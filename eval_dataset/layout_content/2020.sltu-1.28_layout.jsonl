{"layout": 4, "type": "text", "text": "Understanding the sentiment of a comment from a video or an image is an essential task in many applications. Sentiment analysis of a text can be useful for various decision-making processes. One such application is to analyse the popular sentiments of videos on social media based on viewer comments. However, comments from social media do not follow strict rules of grammar, and they contain mixing of more than one language, often written in non-native scripts. Non-availability of annotated code-mixed data for a low-resourced language like Tamil also adds difﬁculty to this problem. To overcome this, we created a gold standard Tamil-English code-switched, sentiment-annotated corpus containing 15,744 comment posts from YouTube. In this paper, we describe the process of creating the corpus and assigning polarities. We present inter-annotator agreement and show the results of sentiment analysis trained on this corpus as a benchmark.

However, an annotated corpus developed for monolingual data cannot deal with code-mixed usage and therefore it fails to yield good results (AlGhamdi et al., 2016; Aguilar et al., 2018) due to mixture of languages at different levels of linguistic analysis.

In a multi-class classiﬁcation setup, micro-average is preferable if there are class imbalances. For instance in our data, we have many more examples of positive classes than other classes. A macro-average will compute the metrics (precision, recall, F-score) independently for each class and then take the average. Thus this metric treats all classes equally and it does not take imbalance into account. A weighted average takes the metrics from each class just like macro but the contribution of each class to the average is weighted by the number of examples available for it.
