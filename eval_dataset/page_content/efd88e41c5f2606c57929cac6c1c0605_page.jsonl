These overarching perspectives are\nbriefly discussed below.\n\nGlobal Change Context\n\nThis assessment follows the model of the 2014 NCA, which\nrecognized that climate change is one of a number of global\nchanges affecting society, the environment, the economy,\nand public health.* While changes in demographics, socio-\neconomic factors, and trends in health status are discussed\nin Chapter 1: Introduction: Climate Change and Human\nHealth, discussion of other global changes, such as land-use\nchange, air and water pollution, and rising consumption of\nresources by a growing and wealthier global population, are\nlimited in this assessment.\n\nComplex Linkages and the Role of Non-Climate\nStressors\n\nMany factors may exacerbate or moderate the impact of cli-\nmate change on human health. For example, a population’s\nvulnerability 1) may be affected by direct climate changes\nor by non-climate factors (such as changes in population,\neconomic development, education, infrastructure, behavior,\ntechnology, and ecosystems); 2) may differ across regions\nand in urban, rural, coastal, and other communities; and 3)\nmay be influenced by individual vulnerability factors such\n\nas age, socioeconomic status, and existing physical and/or\nmental illness or disability. These considerations are summa-\nrized in Chapter 1: Introduction: Climate Change and Human\nHealth and Chapter 9: Populations of Concern. There are\nlimited studies that quantify how climate impacts interact\nwith the factors listed above or how these interactions can\nlead to many other compounding, secondary, or indirect\nhealth effects. However, where possible, this assessment\nidentifies key environmental, institutional, social, and be-\nhavioral influences on health impacts.\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nvill\n\nCumulative, Compounding, or Secondary Impacts\nClimate and health impacts do not occur in isolation and an\nindividual or community could face multiple threats at the\nsame time, at different stages in one’s life, or accumulating\nover the course of one’s life. Some of these impacts, such as\nthe combination of high ozone levels on hot days (see Ch.\n\n3: Air Quality Impacts) or cascading effects during extreme\nevents (see Ch. 4: Extreme Events), have clear links to one\nanother. In other cases, people may be threatened simulta-\nneously by seemingly unconnected risks, such as increased\nexposure to Lyme disease and extreme heat. These impacts\ncan also be compounded by secondary or tertiary impacts,\nsuch as climate change impacts on access to or disruption of\nhealthcare services, damages to infrastructure, or effects on\nthe economy.\n\nSocietal Choices and Adaptive Behavior\n\nEnvironmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are\ntightly coupled, and as a result, climate change impacts can\neither be amplified or reduced by cultural and socioeconom-\nic decisions.? Adaptive capacity ranges from an individual’s\nability to acclimatize to different meteorological conditions\nto a community’s ability to prepare for and recover from\ndamage, injuries, and lives lost due to extreme weather\nevents. Awareness and communication of health threats to\nthe public health community, practitioners, and the pub-\nlic is an important factor in the incidence, diagnosis, and\ntreatment of climate-related health outcomes. Recognition\nof these interactions, together with recognition of multiple\nsources of vulnerability, helps identify what information\ndecision makers need as they manage risks.\n\nInternational Context\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon; the causes and the\nimpacts involve energy-use, economic, and risk-manage-\nment decisions across the globe.’ Impacts, vulnerabilities,\nand opportunities in the United States are related in com-\nplex and interactive ways with changes outside the United\nStates, and vice versa. The health of Americans is affected\nby climate changes and health impacts experienced in other\nparts of the world.\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Human Health in the United States\n", "vlm_text": "Over arching Perspectives \nFive over arching perspectives, derived from decades of  observations, analysis, and experience, have helped to  shape this report: 1) climate change is happening in the  context of other ongoing changes across the United States  and around the globe; 2) there are complex linkages and  important non-climate stressors that affect individual and  community health; 3) many of the health threats described  in this report do not occur in isolation but may be cumula- tive, compounding, or secondary; 4) climate change impacts  can either be amplified or reduced by individual, commu- nity, and societal decisions; and 5) climate change related  impacts, vulnerabilities, and opportunities in the United  States are linked to impacts and changes outside the United  States, and vice versa. These over arching perspectives are  briefly discussed below. \nGlobal Change Context \nThis assessment follows the model of the 2014 NCA, which  recognized that climate change is one of a number of global  changes affecting society, the environment, the economy,  and public health.  While changes in demographics, socio- economic factors, and trends in health status are discussed  in Chapter 1: Introduction: Climate Change and Human  Health, discussion of other global changes, such as land-use  change, air and water pollution, and rising consumption of  resources by a growing and wealthier global population, are  limited in this assessment. \nComplex Linkages and the Role of Non-Climate  Stressors  \nMany factors may exacerbate or moderate the impact of cli- mate change on human health. For example, a population’s  vulnerability 1) may be affected by direct climate changes  or by non-climate factors (such as changes in population,  economic development, education, infrastructure, behavior,  technology, and ecosystems); 2) may differ across regions  and in urban, rural, coastal, and other communities; and 3)  may be influenced by individual vulnerability factors such  as age, socioeconomic status, and existing physical and/or  mental illness or disability. These considerations are summa- rized in Chapter 1: Introduction: Climate Change and Human  Health and Chapter 9: Populations of Concern. There are  limited studies that quantify how climate impacts interact  with the factors listed above or how these interactions can  lead to many other compounding, secondary, or indirect  health effects. However, where possible, this assessment  identifies key environmental, institutional, social, and be- havioral influences on health impacts.  \nCumulative, Compounding, or Secondary Impacts \nClimate and health impacts do not occur in isolation and an  individual or community could face multiple threats at the  same time, at different stages in one’s life, or accumulating  over the course of one’s life. Some of these impacts, such as  the combination of high ozone levels on hot days (see Ch.  3: Air Quality Impacts) or cascading effects during extreme  events (see Ch. 4: Extreme Events), have clear links to one  another. In other cases, people may be threatened simulta- neously by seemingly unconnected risks, such as increased  exposure to Lyme disease and extreme heat. These impacts  can also be compounded by secondary or tertiary impacts,  such as climate change impacts on access to or disruption of  healthcare services, damages to infrastructure, or effects on  the economy.  \nSocietal Choices and Adaptive Behavior \nEnvironmental, cultural, and socioeconomic systems are  tightly coupled, and as a result, climate change impacts can  either be amplified or reduced by cultural and socio eco nom- ic decisions.  Adaptive capacity ranges from an individual’s  ability to acclimatize to different meteorological conditions  to a community’s ability to prepare for and recover from  damage, injuries, and lives lost due to extreme weather  events. Awareness and communication of health threats to  the public health community, practitioners, and the pub- lic is an important factor in the incidence, diagnosis, and  treatment of climate-related health outcomes. Recognition  of these interactions, together with recognition of multiple  sources of vulnerability, helps identify what information  decision makers need as they manage risks. \nInternational Context \nClimate change is a global phenomenon; the causes and the  impacts involve energy-use, economic, and risk-manage- ment decisions across the globe.  Impacts, vulnerabilities,  and opportunities in the United States are related in com- plex and interactive ways with changes outside the United  States, and vice versa. The health of Americans is affected  by climate changes and health impacts experienced in other  parts of the world.  "}
