In  particular, the definition of a refugee codified in article 1(A)(2) of the Refugee Convention and in  EU law has been incorporated into section 3 of the German Asylum Act (Asylgesetz, AsylG).  It  should be noted that German law must be interpreted in line with the requirements set out in the  EU directives, in particular with regard to the constitutional right to asylum, which is not  equivalent to refugee status.

This has caused “significant  repercussions in terms of resources and accommodation logistics, as well as in relation to other  key aspects, including international protection, integration as well as the return of those found  not to be deserving of international protection.” 7  The majority of asylum seekers are nationals of  Sudan, Syria, Eritrea, Somalia, and Libya.  In 2020, Malta and Libya signed a memorandum of  understanding to establish coordination between the two countries to help stop illegal migration.   \nII.  Legislation   \nThe International Protection Act provides the framework for those seeking international  protection and refugee status in Malta. Article 2 of the act defines the term refugee as  \na third country national who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons  of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion,  is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling  to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and  being outside the country of his former habitual residence, as a result of such events is  unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.   \nActs of persecution are defined as   \n(a) acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence;  (b) legal, administrative, police, and/or judicial measures   (c) prosecution or punishment which is disproportionate or discriminatory;  (d) denial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate or discriminatory manner;  (e) prosecution or punishment for refusal to perform military service in a conflict, where  performing military service would include crimes or acts falling within the scope of the  grounds for exclusion as set out in article 12(2);  (f) acts of a gender-specific or child-specific nature.   \nThe events that cause the well-founded fear of persecution may arise after the applicant has left  the country, or be based on acts the applicant has engaged in since they left the country of origin,  unless this is “based on circumstances which the applicant has created by his own decision since  leaving the country of origin.” 12   "}

Accelerated Procedure\n\nIn 2021, to help reduce the backlog, the IPA discontinued applications as implicitly withdrawn\nwhere applicants had missed their calls for an interview or failed to renew a document or\ncomplete a questionnaire.® Malta also prioritized the processing of cases the IPA considered\nprima facie inadmissible or manifestly unfounded,” using an accelerated procedure that does not\nprovide a route for appeal of rejected applications.*” Under the accelerated procedure, once the\nIPA determines that an application is manifestly unfounded, it must be examined within three\nworking days, the applicant must be interviewed, and a decision must be made within this\ntimeframe. While the applicant is not permitted to appeal the decision, IPAT automatically\nexamines and reviews the decision. This must occur within three days.

Accelerated Procedure   \nIn 2021, to help reduce the backlog, the IPA discontinued applications as implicitly withdrawn  where applicants had missed their calls for an interview or failed to renew a document or  complete a questionnaire.  Malta also prioritized the processing of cases the IPA considered  prima facie inadmissible or manifestly unfounded,  using an accelerated procedure that does not  provide a route for appeal of rejected applications.  Under the accelerated procedure, once the  IPA determines that an application is manifestly unfounded, it must be examined within three  working days, the applicant must be interviewed, and a decision must be made within this  timeframe.  While the applicant is not permitted to appeal the decision, IPAT automatically  examines and reviews the decision. This must occur within three days.

According to section 27(2) of the Immigrant and  Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR),  they must appear without delay at the nearest port of  entry for examination. Migrants may also make a claim while already in Canada.   \nThe examination process begins with a primary series of questions by a border security officer  (BSO )  at the port of entry. This officer may refer the migrant to a secondary officer for further  questioning, beginning the “Immigration Secondary” stage of examination.   "}

Should the examination process lead to a  conclusion of admissibility, a refugee claimant will be referred to the Refugee Protection Division  (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) for further processing.

It's noted that it is rare for someone with the right to enter Canada to be referred to Immigration Secondary. If the person is not Canadian, the question helps the BSO determine whether a passport, a visa, or an electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) is required to enter Canada."}

Initial Registration Phase  \nFollowing the termination of the UNHCR’s registration procedure in September 2018,  the first  phase of obtaining international protection has now become the registration of the application for  international protection by a Provincial Directorate of Migration Management (PDMM). PDMMs  are set up in all 81 provinces of Turkey and are organized under and directed by the Presidency.  In practice, an asylum seeker can apply for international protection in two main forms: by  physically appearing in person on the premises of a PDMM, where the asylum seeker may lodge  an application for himself and on behalf of his family members,  or by making the application at  a border point of entry or while under detention after being intercepted for irregular presence. \nAn asylum seeker who wishes to apply for international protection while in the territory of  Turkey must approach the PDMM. While the law does not provide a deadline for making the  application from the date of entry, it must be made “within a reasonable time” to avoid sanctions  for irregular entry and stay, and the reasonableness will be determined on a case-by-case basis.

The Ministry of  Interior Affairs is authorized to determine the border points of entry from which foreigners  subject to the temporary protection regime may enter the country.  Upon entry, the entrants’  persons, their belongings, and vehicles are subjected to search by security forces, and their  personal identification information and date and place of entry are noted in an official report.   The entrants are then in the shortest time possible transferred to police units, which will take the  entrants to the closest “transfer center.” 73  Persons subject to the temporary protection regime who  are already present in the territory and voluntarily apply to the provincial governorate for  temporary protection are directed to transfer centers.  Those who are intercepted before  voluntary application are taken to transfer centers escorted by the police.  Armed persons who  enter the country seeking temporary protection and armed persons who deserted the armed  forces that they were a part of to seek temporary protection are disarmed by security forces upon  entry and are transferred to transfer centers that are different than those hosting civilians.   \nThe RTP foresees that the initial registration of temporary protection applicants is to be done by  the GDMM [now the Presidency] in transfer centers.  However, the RTP provides that the  registration may be done by provincial governorates if the capacity of transfer centers is  insufficient. In practice, it appears that as of 2020, the PDMMs (which are part of the provincial  governorates) are formally tasked with making the initial registration of temporary  protection seekers.    "}

Assessing Credibility   \nThe Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 requires those making a  decision on an asylum claim to take into account the claimant’s credibility and whether the  claimant failed to make an asylum claim in a safe third country.  The interviewer must explore  any issues of the claimant’s credibility, which can be used later when making a balance  assessment on all the evidence.  In cases where there are potentially significant adverse  credibility findings, the interviewer must provide the claimant with the opportunity to explain  or clarify any contradictions or significant inconsistencies in their claim and fill in any areas where  there are gaps or missing information.
