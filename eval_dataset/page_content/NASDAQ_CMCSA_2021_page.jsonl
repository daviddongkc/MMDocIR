We may also be subject to certain broadband-related\ncommitments as a condition of receiving federal or state broadband funding.\n\nBroadband Deployment and Adoption Initiatives\n\nThere have been, and may continue to be, broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of COVID-19 relief\nefforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, that could subsidize other service providers building networks within our footprint or\npotentially could subsidize expansion of our network to new areas. We cannot predict how such funds will be awarded or the impact of these initiatives on\nour businesses.\n\nIn 2021, the FCC launched the federal Emergency Broadband Benefit (“EBB”) program to provide a monthly discount toward broadband service for\neligible low-income households during the COVID-19 pandemic. Congress recently created the Affordability Connectivity Program (“ACP”), a new\nlonger-term program that replaced EBB. We participated in EBB and are participating in ACP. We cannot predict the extent to which eligible households\nwill opt to use their ACP benefit towards our broadband services.\n\nOpen Internet Regulations\n\nVarious forms of Open Internet regulations can significantly affect our broadband services. In 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband\ninternet access service as a Title II “telecommunications service” under the Communications Act and classified it as an “information service” under Title I.\nIn addition, it eliminated its prior “net neutrality” rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content on the internet; impairing or degrading\nlawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (“throttling”); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in\nfavor of an affiliate (“paid or affiliated prioritization”); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging\nconsumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or\ndisadvantaging edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to consumers (“general conduct standard”). The\nFCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and it expressly preempted all state Open\nInternet laws. In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid\nor affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in paid or\naffiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public\ncommitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule.\n\nThe FCC’s 2017 decision was challenged and, in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld the FCC’s decision, including\nthe classification of broadband as a Title I information service and repeal of its prior rules. However, it vacated the FCC’s express preemption of all state\nOpen Internet laws, but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a case-by-case basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy\nor under other theories and precedent on implied preemption.\n\nSeveral states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways, and\nnew state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court. Such attempts by the\nstates to regulate have the potential to create differing and/or conflicting state regulations.\n\nThe FCC under the Biden Administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify it as a\n“telecommunications service,” which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications\nAct. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates, speeds, data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services\nand could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content, applications and service providers, including backbone\ninterconnection arrangements. Any FCC action could impact state Open Internet initiatives and related legal challenges, and also could prompt further\nlitigation. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services.

Congress recently created the Affordability Connectivity Program   $\\left(^{\\ast}\\mathrm{ACP^{\\ast}}\\right)$  ), a new longer-term program that replaced EBB. We participated in EBB and are participating in ACP. We cannot predict the extent to which eligible households will opt to use their ACP benefit towards our broadband services. \nOpen Internet Regulations \nVarious forms of Open Internet regulations can significantly affect our broadband services. In 2017, the FCC reversed its prior classification of broadband internet access service as a Title II “telecommunications service” under the Communications Act and classified it as an “information service” under Title I. In addition, it eliminated its prior “net neutrality” rules prohibiting ISPs from blocking access to lawful content on the internet; impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications or services (“throttling”); prioritizing certain internet traffic in exchange for consideration or in favor of an affiliate (“paid or affiliated prioritization”); and generally prohibiting ISPs from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging consumers’ ability to access and use the lawful internet content, applications, services or devices of their choosing or unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging edge providers’ ability to make lawful content, applications, services, or devices available to consumers (“general conduct standard”). The FCC stated that jurisdiction to regulate ISP conduct would rest at the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and it expressly preempted all state Open Internet laws. In addition, the FCC revised the transparency rule to add a requirement that ISPs disclose any blocking and throttling practices, and any paid or affiliated prioritization practices associated with their broadband offerings. We have disclosed that we do not block, throttle, or engage in paid or affiliated prioritization, and have committed not to block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content. The FTC has authority to enforce these public commitments, and the FCC has authority to enforce compliance with its transparency rule. \nThe FCC’s 2017 decision was challenged and, in 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld the FCC’s decision, including the classification of broadband as a Title I information service and repeal of its prior rules. However, it vacated the FCC’s express preemption of all state Open Internet laws, but noted that state laws may nevertheless be preempted on a case-by-case basis if those regulations conflict with federal law or policy or under other theories and precedent on implied preemption. \nSeveral states have passed or introduced legislation, or have adopted executive orders, that impose Open Internet requirements in a variety of ways, and new state legislation may be introduced and adopted in the future. Certain of these state initiatives have been challenged in court. Such attempts by the states to regulate have the potential to create differing and/or conflicting state regulations. \nThe FCC under the Biden Administration likely will revisit the regulatory classification of broadband internet access service and reclassify it as a “telecommunications service,” which would authorize the FCC to subject it to traditional common carriage regulation under Title II of the Communications Act. Under a Title II framework, the FCC could potentially regulate our customer rates, speeds, data usage thresholds or other terms for internet services and could prohibit or seriously restrict arrangements between us and internet content, applications and service providers, including backbone interconnection arrangements. Any FCC action could impact state Open Internet initiatives and related legal challenges, and also could prompt further litigation. Congress may also consider legislation addressing these regulations and the regulatory framework for broadband internet access services. We cannot predict whether or how the rules might be changed, the impact of potential new legislation, or the outcome of any litigation. \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K "}

We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections\nfor customer proprietary network information related to our voice services.\n\nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For\nexample, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer\ninformation. These enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering\ncontent and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection,\nuse or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and\nonline services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and\nunder.\n\nIn addition, certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing explicit consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective\nstates. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection,\nuse and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to access, delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them.\nMoreover, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when\ncertain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach.\n\nCertain of our businesses are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection\nAct 2018 (“DPA”), which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom,\nrespectively.

In addition, the landscape for music licensing is constantly changing, and music fees we pay are subject to new fee demands and negotiations. We cannot predict how changes to the compulsory copyright license and music licensing will impact the fees that we pay. \nPrivacy and Data Security Regulation \nOur businesses are subject to federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that impose various restrictions and obligations related to privacy and the handling of consumers’ personal information. In the United States, the Communications Act generally restricts cable operators’ nonconsensual collection and disclosure to third parties of cable customers’ personally identifiable information, except for rendering service, conducting legitimate business activities related to the service and responding to legal requests. We are also subject to various state and federal regulations that provide privacy protections for customer proprietary network information related to our voice services. \nThe FTC generally exercises oversight of consumer privacy protections using its enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive acts or practices. For example, the FTC often partners with state attorneys general to enforce transparency requirements regarding the collection and use of consumer information. These enforcement efforts may require ongoing review on our part of new and rapidly evolving technologies and methods for delivering content and advertising to ensure that appropriate notice is given to consumers and consent is obtained where required in connection with the collection, use or sharing of personal information. We are also subject to stringent data security and data retention requirements that apply to website operators and online services directed to children 12 years of age and under, or that knowingly collect or post personal information from children 12 years of age and under. \nIn addition, certain states have enacted detailed laws establishing explicit consumer privacy protections and data security requirements in their respective states. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) gives California residents rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use and sharing of “Personal Information,” as well as rights to access, delete and restrict the sale of certain personal information collected about them. Moreover, all 50 states have security breach notification laws that generally require a business to give notice to consumers and government agencies when certain information has been disclosed to an unauthorized party due to a security breach. \nCertain of our businesses are subject to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the United Kingdom’s Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”), which broadly regulate the processing of personal data collected from individuals in the European Union and United Kingdom, respectively. DPA, GDPR and the Member States’ legislation implementing the GDPR, related rules regulating the privacy of electronic communications services and networks (including “cookie” rules), and various initiatives by regulatory authorities pursuant to these laws affect how we are able to process certain personal data for particular purposes, what we must tell our customers about this processing, and what controls our customers have over such processing. \nPrivacy and data security remained a priority legislative issue in 2021. For example, new laws have been enacted in Virginia and Colorado, which come into effect in 2023 and include many requirements similar to those in the CCPA for companies that collect personal information from consumers in those states. In addition, California voters approved a ballot initiative enacting the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which updates the CCPA and establishes a new California Privacy Protection Agency to oversee implementation and enforcement of the state’s privacy laws. Changes enacted in the CPRA generally go into \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K effect on January 1, 2023, though several aspects of the law remain subject to further rulemaking. Legislation similar to the laws enacted in Virginia and Colorado is under consideration in many other states, and various regulatory authorities are considering rulemakings around privacy and data collection. We cannot predict how these changes to the laws will affect our business, or whether any legislation or proposed rules currently under consideration will be enacted or adopted or what the impact of any such laws or regulations may be on our businesses.

Broadband-deployment funding initiatives at the federal and state level, including as part of\nCOVID-19 relief efforts as well as federal infrastructure legislation enacted in 2021, may result in other service providers deploying new\nsubsidized internet access networks within our footprint. Competition for Cable Communications’ video services consists primarily of DTC\nstreaming and other OTT service providers, DBS providers and telecommunications companies with fiber-based networks. Sky faces competition\nfor its video services from cable and telecommunications providers in its European markets. Our voice and wireless services primarily compete\nwith wireless and wireline telecommunications providers. Many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable\npricing, which has increased competition.\n\n* | NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information\ncontent, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, popular\ncontent (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as\nDTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract\nviewers.\n\nConsolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as\nmay the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive\npricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or\ncooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for\ninternet or wireless phone services.\n\nThe ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our\ncustomers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be\nnegatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience.\n\nChanges in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models.\n\nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the\nnumber of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other\nOTT services, the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal’s television networks decrease,\neven as Cable Communications’ broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and\nwill continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access\ncommunications services, and how much they pay for such content.\n\nFor example, Cable Communications continues to experience net video customer losses. In Europe, more of Sky’s new video customers have recently\nsubscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to NOW, Sky’s DTC streaming service, instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have\nattempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and\nSky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering\nPeacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video\ndistribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models.\n\nThe increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to\nconsumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by\nconsumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such\nas DVR and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In\naddition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and\nquality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s television channels or to Peacock.\n\n23 Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n", "vlm_text": "Below is a summary of the most significant sources of competition; for a more detailed description of the competition facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and refer to the “Competition” discussion within that section. \n• Cable Communications’ and Sky’s broadband services compete primarily against wireline telecommunications companies, including many that are increasing deployment of fiber-based networks, wireless telecommunications companies offering internet services (such as 4G and 5G wireless broadband services), certain electric cooperatives and municipalities in the United States that own and operate their own broadband networks and DBS and newer satellite broadband providers.

Many of our competitors offer customers bundled products and services with favorable pricing, which has increased competition. • NBCUniversal and Sky face substantial and increasing competition from providers of similar types of entertainment, sports, news and information content, as well as from other forms of entertainment and recreational activities. NBCUniversal and Sky must compete to obtain talent, popular content (including sports programming) and other resources required to successfully operate their businesses. This competition has intensified as DTC streaming and other OTT service providers seek to develop high-quality programming and acquire live sports programming to attract viewers. \nConsolidation of, or cooperation between, our competitors, including suppliers and distributors of content, may increase competition in all of these areas, as may the emergence of additional competitors with significant resources, greater efficiencies of scale, fewer regulatory burdens and more competitive pricing and packaging, who are competing with our businesses in all forms of content distribution and production. For example, such consolidation or cooperation may allow competitors to offer free or lower cost streaming services, potentially on an exclusive basis, through unlimited data-usage plans for internet or wireless phone services. \nThe ability of our businesses to compete effectively also depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituencies, including our customers, consumers, advertisers, business partners, employees, investors and government authorities. In addition, our ability to compete will be negatively affected if we do not provide our customers with a satisfactory customer experience. \nChanges in consumer behavior continue to adversely affect our businesses and challenge existing business models. \nDistribution platforms for viewing and purchasing content over the internet have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of competitors that all our businesses face and challenge existing business models. As consumers increasingly turn to DTC streaming and other OTT services, the number of Cable Communications’ video customers and amount of subscriber fees paid to NBCUniversal’s television networks decrease, even as Cable Communications’ broadband services have become more important to consumers. DTC streaming and other OTT services have driven, and will continue to drive, changes in consumer behavior as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and access communications services, and how much they pay for such content. \nFor example, Cable Communications continues to experience net video customer losses. In Europe, more of Sky’s new video customers have recently subscribed, and may continue to subscribe, to NOW, Sky’s DTC streaming service, instead of its traditional DTH video service. Although we have attempted to adapt our video service offerings and enhance our broadband services for changing consumer behaviors, for example, by deploying the X1 and Sky Q platforms, Flex, developing new smart televisions using our global technology platform at Sky and Cable Communications, and by offering Peacock, the continuing trend of content owners delivering their content directly to consumers rather than through, or in addition to, traditional video distribution channels continues to disrupt traditional distribution business models. \nThe increase in DTC streaming and other OTT service providers also has significantly increased the number of entertainment choices available to consumers, which has intensified audience fragmentation and disaggregated the way that content traditionally has been distributed and viewed by consumers. The use of DTC streaming and other OTT services reduce traditional television viewership, and coupled with time-shifting technologies, such as DVR and on demand services, have caused and likely will continue to cause audience ratings declines for our television programming channels. In addition, as more programming providers offer their content directly to consumers through their own apps or platforms, they may reduce the quantity and quality of the programming they license to NBCUniversal or Sky’s television channels or to Peacock. \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K Our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers, and shifting business models could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, businesses and results of operations.

Part of Cable Communications’ programming expenses include payments to certain local broadcast\ntelevision stations in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect\nto continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations.

The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute\ntelevision programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and\ninternational consumer markets.

These incidents include computer hackings, cyber attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, phishing attacks, malicious social engineering, and other malicious activities. Incidents also may be caused inadvertently by us or our third-party vendors, such as process breakdowns and vulnerabilities in security architecture or system design. \nCyber threats and attacks are constantly evolving and are growing in sophistication and frequency, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Some cyber attacks have had, and in the future can have, cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across networks, information systems and other technologies across the world and create latent vulnerabilities in our and third-party vendors’ systems and other technologies. Moreover, as we also obtain certain confidential, proprietary and personal information about our customers, personnel and vendors, and in some cases provide this information to third party vendors who agree to protect it, we face the risk that this information may become compromised through a cyber attack or data breach, misappropriation, misuse, leakage, falsification or accidental release or loss of information.

These\nincreases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers.\n\nWe expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases, although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of\ncontract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\n\nTechnical and Product Support Expenses\n\nExpenses include costs to complete service call and installation activities; costs for network operations, product development, fulfillment and provisioning;\nthe cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the\nnumber of customers receiving service, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\n\nCustomer Service Expenses\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\n\nAdvertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased spending associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings, including\nadvertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics, as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\nFranchise and Other Regulatory Fees\nExpenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities, including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs.\n\nOther Expenses\n\nExpenses primarily include administrative personnel costs; fees paid to third-party channels for which Cable represents the advertising sales efforts; other\nbusiness support costs, including building and office expenses, taxes and billing costs; and bad debt.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense.\n\nCable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\n\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our\nhigher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin was 43.7%, 42.1% and 40.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis.\nAmortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments\nare recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue.\n\nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a\nfilm’s initial release. These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the\ncontent itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical\nperformance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a\nfilm’s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales,\nare revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.\n\nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of\n\n59 Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n", "vlm_text": "required.

Based on this assessment, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our cable franchise rights were higher than the carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not required. \nChanges in market conditions, laws and regulations and key assumptions made in future quantitative assessments, including expected cash flows, competitive factors and discount rates, could negatively impact the results of future impairment testing and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge. \nFilm and Television Content \nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. We have determined that the predominant monetization strategy for the substantial majority of our content is on an individual basis. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. \nOur estimates of ultimate revenue for films generally include revenue from all sources that are expected to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. These estimates are based on the distribution strategy and historical performance of similar content, as well as factors unique to the content itself. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for a film intended for theatrical release is the film’s theatrical performance, as subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of a film has historically exhibited a high correlation to its theatrical performance. Upon a film’s release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets, including from content licensing across multiple platforms and home entertainment sales, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. \nWith respect to television series or other owned television programming, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond its initial license window. Initial estimates of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue attributed to the initial license window. Once it is determined that a television series or other owned television programming can be licensed beyond the initial license window, revenue estimates for these additional windows or platforms, such as U.S. and international syndication, home entertainment, and other distribution platforms, are included in ultimate revenue. Revenue estimates for produced episodes include revenue expected to be earned within 10 years of delivery of the initial episode or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later.

The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal’s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the\ncombination of NBCUniversal’s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock\n(previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal’s television studio production operations\n(previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment.

Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation and classification within the fair value hierarchy. \nNote 2: Segment Information \nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. In 2021, we changed our presentation of segment operating results. We now present our operations for (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications; (2) NBCUniversal in three reportable business segments: Media, Studios and Theme Parks; and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment. The changes reflect a reorganized operating structure in NBCUniversal’s television and streaming businesses and primarily include: (i) the combination of NBCUniversal’s television networks (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the operations of Peacock\n\n (previously reported in Corporate and Other) in the Media segment, and (ii) the presentation of NBCUniversal’s television studio production operations\n\n (previously reported in Cable Networks and Broadcast Television) with the studio operations of Filmed Entertainment in the Studios segment.

{"page": 79, "image_path": "page_images/NASDAQ_CMCSA_2021_79.jpg", "ocr_text": "Table of Contents\n\nComcast Corporation\n\nCable Communications Segment\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of our broadband, video, voice, wireless and other services to residential customers in the United States under the\nXfinity brand, which we market individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate. We also provide these and other services to business customers\nand sell advertising.\n\nResidential\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features\ncustomers receive. Revenue from customers that purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated between the separate services based on the\nrespective stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services.\nSignificant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are\ncombined in a bundle. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over\nthe period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are\ntypically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent\nwith our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and\nwireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize\nrevenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a\nyear. We also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are generally the sales agent in these\narrangements and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within broadband revenue.\n\nUnder the terms of cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue.\nWe generally pass these and other similar fees through to our customers and classify these fees in the respective Cable Communications services revenue\nwith the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses.\n\nBusiness Services\n\nRevenue is generated from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our service offerings for small business\nlocations primarily include broadband services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, and include\ncertain other features specific to businesses. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and other services to meet the needs of\nmedium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators.\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically\nranging from 2 years for small and medium-sized businesses to up to 5 years for larger enterprises. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be\nearned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual business services revenue, of which the substantial\nmajority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers with contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We\nreceive payments based on a billing schedule established in our contracts, which is typically on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions\nare generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\nAdvertising\n\nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements\nwith cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases,\nthe available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some\nmarkets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to\nmultichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales\nforce to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the\nsale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms\nand conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled.\nAdvertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is\nrecognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30\nto 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to\ncustomers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized\nwhen services are provided.\n\n77 Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n", "vlm_text": "Table of Contents \nCable Communications Segment \nRevenue is generated from the sale of our broadband, video, voice, wireless and other services to residential customers in the United States under the Xfinity brand, which we market individually and as bundled services at a discounted rate. We also provide these and other services to business customers and sell advertising. \nResidential \nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Subscription rates and related charges vary according to the services and features customers receive. Revenue from customers that purchase bundled services at a discounted rate is allocated between the separate services based on the respective stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the current prices at which we separately sell the services. Significant judgment is used to determine performance obligations that should be accounted for separately and the allocation of revenue when services are combined in a bundle. Customers are typically billed in advance and pay on a monthly basis. Installation fees are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of benefit to the customer, which is less than a year. While a portion of our customers are subject to contracts for their services, which are typically 1 to 2 years in length, based on our evaluation of the terms of these contracts, we recognize revenue for these services on a basis that is consistent with our customers that are not subject to contracts. Our services generally involve customer premise equipment, such as set-top boxes, cable modems and wireless gateways. The timing and pattern of recognition for customer premise equipment revenue are consistent with those of our services. We recognize revenue from the sale of wireless handsets at the point of sale. Sales commissions are expensed as incurred, as the related period of benefit is less than a year. We also have arrangements to sell certain DTC streaming services to our customers. We have concluded we are generally the sales agent in these arrangements and we record net commission revenue as earned, which is generally as customers are billed on a monthly basis, within broadband revenue. \nUnder the terms of cable franchise agreements, we are generally required to pay the cable franchising authority an amount based on gross video revenue. We generally pass these and other similar fees through to our customers and classify these fees in the respective Cable Communications services revenue with the corresponding costs included in other operating and administrative expenses. \nBusiness Services \nRevenue is generated from subscribers to a variety of our products and services which are offered to businesses. Our service offerings for small business locations primarily include broadband services, as well as voice and video services, that are similar to those provided to residential customers, and include certain other features specific to businesses. We also offer Ethernet network services that connect multiple locations and other services to meet the needs of medium-sized customers and larger enterprises, and we provide cellular backhaul services to mobile network operators. \nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided on a monthly basis. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging from 2 years for small and medium-sized businesses to up to 5 years for larger enterprises. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual business services revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers with contracts may only discontinue service in accordance with the terms of their contracts. We receive payments based on a billing schedule established in our contracts, which is typically on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms. \nAdvertising \nRevenue is generated from the sale of advertising and technology, tools and solutions relating to advertising businesses. As part of distribution agreements with cable networks, we generally receive an allocation of scheduled advertising time that we sell to local, regional and national advertisers. In most cases, the available advertising units are sold by our sales force. We also represent the advertising sales efforts of other multichannel video providers in some markets. Since we are acting as the principal in these arrangements, we record the advertising that is sold in advertising revenue and the fees paid to multichannel video providers in other operating and administrative expenses. In some cases, we work with representation firms as an extension of our sales force to sell a portion of the advertising units allocated to us and record the revenue net of agency commissions. In addition, we generate revenue from the sale of advertising on digital platforms. We enter into advertising arrangements with customers and have determined that a contract exists once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and the timing of airing is scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or viewed within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized in the period in which advertisements are aired or viewed. Payment terms vary by contract, although terms generally require payment within 30 to 60 days from when advertisements are aired or viewed. In addition, we also provide technology, tools, data-driven services and marketplace solutions to customers in the media industry to facilitate advertisers more effectively engaging with their target audiences. Revenue earned in this manner is recognized when services are provided. \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K "}

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and\nresiduals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated\nultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and\nhistorical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on\nestimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the\nlife that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film\nin movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements\ncan take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the\nfilm. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion\nof the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our\ncapitalized film costs and the investor’s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and\nproduction costs. The investor’s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known.\nLicensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and\naccrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either\nowned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent\nthe unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly\nmonetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an\nindividual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation\nof programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type.

Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs are based on anticipated release patterns and distribution strategies, public acceptance and historical results for similar productions. Amortization for content predominantly monetized with other owned or licensed content is recorded based on estimated usage. In determining the method of amortization and estimated life of an acquired film or television library, we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do not capitalize costs related to the distribution of a film in movie theaters or the licensing or sale of a film or television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution. \nWe may enter into cofinancing arrangements with third parties to jointly finance or distribute certain of our film productions. Cofinancing arrangements can take various forms, but in most cases involve the grant of an economic interest in a film to an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor’s interest in the profit or loss of the film is recorded as either a charge or a benefit, respectively, in programming and production costs. The investor’s interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method. \nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast. \nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs. \nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and record an impairment charge to the extent the unamortized costs exceed the fair value. Owned content is assessed either individually or in identified film groups, for content predominantly monetized on an individual basis or with other content, respectively. The substantial majority of our owned content is evaluated for impairment on an individual title basis. Licensed content that is not part of a film group is generally assessed in packages, channels or dayparts. A daypart is an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. Licensed content is tested for impairment primarily on a channel, network or platform basis, with the exception of our broadcast networks and owned local broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented. \nSports Rights \nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative value. Estimated relative value is generally based on the terms of the contract and the nature of and potential revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment. When cash payments, including advanced payments, exceed the relative value of the sports rights delivered, we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content. \nThe table shows \"Income Before Income Taxes\" for the years ended December 31, presented in millions of dollars.

In addition, we have separately committed\nto fund Atairos $45 million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund\nfrom $50 million to $100 million, with at least $40 million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic\ninterests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately 99% of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately 86%\nof any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis.\n\nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance o!\nAtairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies.\nWe therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment.

We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nwe made cash capital contributions totaling $47 million, $383 million and $571 million, respectively, to Atairos. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our\ninvestment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was $4.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively.\n\nHulu and Collateralized Obligation\n\nIn May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the “Hulu Transaction”) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, whereby we\nrelinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. We\nalso acquired our proportionate share of the approximate 10% interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T for approximately $477 million, increasing our\nownership interest to approximately 33% from approximately 30%.\n\nFollowing the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to $1.5 billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded\nwith member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of\nfuture equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of 21%. The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and\ncall provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require\nus to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of $27.5 billion for 100% of the equity of Hulu.\nThe minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately $5.8 billion upon exercise of the put or call.\n\nIn connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our\ncontent license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and we obtained the right, beginning in 2020, to modify certain exclusive content licenses so that\nwe can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reduced license fees.\n\nIn August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of $5.2 billion under a term loan facility\ndue March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our\ninvestment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and\nuntil the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of\namounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our consolidated\nbalance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation”, respectively. The recorded value of our\ninvestment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of December 31, 2021, our collateralized\nobligation had both a carrying value and estimated fair value of $5.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for\ndebt with similar terms and remaining maturities.\n\n87 Comcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n", "vlm_text": "decreased our commitment to fund Atairos from up to   $\\S5$   billion to up to   $\\S4.5$   billion in the aggregate at any one time, subject to certain offsets, with the maximum amount of annual capital calls reduced to  $\\S400$   million, plus certain amounts previously distributed. In addition, we have separately committed to fund Atairos  $\\S45$   million annually for a management fee, subject to certain adjustments. The management company investors have committed to fund from   $\\S50$   million to   $\\S100$   million, with at least   $\\S40$   million to be funded by our former CFO, subject to his continued role with Atairos. Our economic interests do not carry voting rights and obligate us to absorb approximately  $99\\%$   of any losses and they provide us the right to receive approximately   $86\\%$  of any residual returns in Atairos, in either case on a cumulative basis. \nWe have concluded that Atairos is a VIE, that we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Atairos as we have no voting rights and only certain consent rights, and that we are not a related party with our former CFO or the management companies. We therefore do not consolidate Atairos and account for our investment as an equity method investment. Certain distributions retained by Atairos on our behalf are accounted for as advances and classified within other investments. Atairos may pledge our remaining unfunded capital commitment as security to lenders in connection with certain financing arrangements. This has no effect on our funding commitments. There are no other liquidity arrangements, guarantees or other financial commitments between Comcast and Atairos, and therefore our maximum risk of financial loss is our investment balance and our remaining unfunded capital commitment of  $\\S1.5$   billion as of December 31, 2021. \nAtairos follows investment company accounting and records its investments at their fair values each reporting period with the net gains or losses reflected in its statement of operations. We recognize our share of these gains and losses in equity in net income (losses) of investees, net. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made cash capital contributions totaling   $\\S47$   million,   $\\S383$   million and  $\\S571$   million, respectively, to Atairos. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our investment, inclusive of advances classified within other investments, was  $\\S4.7$   billion and   $\\S3.9$   billion, respectively. \nHulu and Collateralized Obligation \nIn May 2019, we entered into a series of agreements (the “Hulu Transaction”) with The Walt Disney Company and certain of its subsidiaries, whereby we relinquished our board seats and substantially all voting rights associated with our investment in Hulu, and Disney assumed full operational control. We also acquired our proportionate share of the approximate   $10\\%$   interest in Hulu previously held by AT&T for approximately   $\\S477$   million, increasing our ownership interest to approximately  $33\\%$   from approximately   $30\\%$  . \nFollowing the Hulu Transaction, future capital calls are limited to   $\\S1.5$   billion in the aggregate each year, with any excess funding requirements funded with member loans. We have the right, but not the obligation, to fund our proportionate share of these capital calls, and if we elect not to fund our share of future equity capital calls, our ownership interest will be diluted, subject to an ownership floor of  $21\\%$  . The Hulu Transaction agreements include put and call provisions regarding our ownership interest in Hulu, pursuant to which, as early as January 2024, we can require Disney to buy, and Disney can require us to sell our interest, in either case, for fair value at that future time subject to a minimum equity value of   $\\S27.5$   billion for   $100\\%$   of the equity of Hulu. The minimum total equity value and ownership floor guarantee minimum proceeds of approximately  $\\S5.8$   billion upon exercise of the put or call. \nIn connection with the Hulu Transaction, we agreed to extend certain licenses of NBCUniversal content until late 2024. We can terminate most of our content license agreements with Hulu beginning in 2022, and we obtained the right, beginning in 2020, to modify certain exclusive content licenses so that we can exhibit the content on our platforms in return for reduced license fees. \nIn August 2019, we entered into a financing arrangement with a syndicate of banks whereby we received proceeds of  $\\S5.2$   billion under a term loan facility due March 2024. The principal amount of the term loan is secured by the proceeds guaranteed by Disney under the put/call provisions related to our investment in Hulu. The proceeds from the put/call provisions are available only for the repayment of the term loan and are not available to us unless and until the bank lenders are fully paid under the term loan provisions. The bank lenders have no rights to proceeds from the put/call provisions in excess of amounts owed under the term loan. As a result of this transaction, we now present our investment in Hulu and the term loan separately in our consolidated balance sheet in the captions “investment securing collateralized obligation” and “collateralized obligation”, respectively. The recorded value of our investment reflects our historical cost in applying the equity method, and as a result, is less than its fair value. As of December 31, 2021, our collateralized obligation had both a carrying value and estimated fair value of  $\\S5.2$   billion. The estimated fair value was based on Level 2 inputs that use interest rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K "}

We do not amortize our\ncable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory,\ncontractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows.

A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment\nresults in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the\nfair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves\nsignificant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA\ngenerated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other\nindefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated\nfair value and the carrying value of the assets.

We also capitalize costs associated with arrangements that constitute the purchase of, or convey a\nlicense to, software licenses. We generally amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and\ntraining costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs\nand amortize them over the life of the associated hardware.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating\nresults, trends or other determinants of fair value.

Our cable franchise rights represent the values we attributed to agreements with state and local authorities that allow access to homes and businesses in cable service areas acquired in business combinations. We do not amortize our cable franchise rights because we have determined that they meet the definition of indefinite-lived intangible assets since there are no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the period over which these rights will contribute to our cash flows. We reassess this determination periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. The purchase of spectrum rights is presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows. \nWe assess the recoverability of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. Our three Cable Communications divisions represent the unit of account we use to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights. We evaluate the unit of account used to test for impairment of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur to ensure impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise rights and other indefinite-lived intangible assets primarily based on a discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment. When analyzing the fair values indicated under the discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information. If the fair value of our cable franchise rights or other indefinite-lived intangible assets were less than the carrying amount, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the assets. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. We did not recognize any material impairment charges in any of the periods presented.   \nThe table appears to present financial data over a period of five years, from 2022 to 2026. The figures are in millions of dollars, as indicated above the table. For each year, the corresponding monetary amount is listed next to it:\n- 2022: $5,140 million\n- 2023: $4,513 million\n- 2024: $3,737 million\n- 2025: $2,996 million\n- 2026: $2,403 million\n\nThe table shows a decreasing trend in the values from 2022 to 2026.\nFinite-lived intangible assets are subject to amortization and consist primarily of customer relationships acquired in business combinations, software, trade names and intellectual property rights. Our finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life or the term of the associated agreement. \nWe capitalize direct development costs associated with internal-use software, including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees devoting time to these software projects. We also capitalize costs associated with arrangements that constitute the purchase of, or convey a license to, software licenses. We generally amortize them on a straight-line basis over a period not to exceed five years. We expense maintenance and training costs, as well as costs incurred during the preliminary stage of a project, as they are incurred. We capitalize initial operating system software costs and amortize them over the life of the associated hardware. \nWe evaluate the recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is based on the cash flows generated by the underlying asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of amortization expense. \nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K "}

The ZONES are issued in denominations of one ZONES and integral multiples thereof. \nInterest \nWe make quarterly interest payments in an amount equal to   $\\S0.4082$   per ZONES, or   $2.0\\%$   per year of the original principal amount, plus the amount of any quarterly cash dividend paid on the reference shares attributable to each ZONES. Holders of the ZONES are not expected to receive interest attributable to any cash dividend on the reference shares for this payment period because Sprint has never paid a cash dividend on its Sprint PCS stock. \nInterest on the ZONES accrues from the issue date of the ZONES. We pay this interest quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2000, but subject to our right to defer quarterly \npayments of interest. We also distribute, as additional interest on the ZONES, any property, including cash (other than any quarterly cash dividend), distributed on or with respect to the reference shares (other than publicly traded equity securities, which will themselves become reference shares). If the additional interest on the reference shares includes publicly traded securities (other than equity securities), we will distribute those securities. We will not, however, distribute fractional units of securities. We will pay cash instead of distributing the fractional units. Otherwise, we will distribute the fair market value of any property comprising additional interest as determined in good faith by our board of directors. We will distribute any additional interest to holders of the ZONES on the 20th business day after it is distributed on the reference shares. The record date for any distribution of additional interest is the 10th business day after the date any cash or property is distributed on the reference shares. \nIf extraordinary dividends on the reference shares are paid, the contingent principal amount will be reduced on a quarterly basis to the extent necessary so that the yield to the date of computation (including all interest payments other than those attributable to regular periodic cash "}

Changes in the contingent\nprincipal amount will not affect the amount of the quarterly interest payments.\n\nIf interest or additional interest is payable on a date that is not a business day (as defined at the end of this paragraph),\npayment will be made on the next business day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of this delay). However, if\nthe next business day is in the next calendar year, payment of interest will be made on the preceding business day.

If we terminate a deferral period and subsequently\nelect to defer quarterly interest payments, we will again be subject to the 20 consecutive quarterly period limitation.\n\nWe will not, however, be subject to the 20 consecutive quarterly period limitation on deferral if, as a result of a tender\noffer, an exchange offer, a business combination or otherwise, all reference shares cease to be outstanding, and we subsequently\nelect to defer quarterly payments of interest on the ZONES.\n\nAny deferral of interest payments cannot extend, however, beyond the maturity date of the ZONES. We can never defer\ndistributions of additional interest.\n\nfl\n\nwe defer quarterly payments of interest, the contingent principal amount of the ZONES will increase by the amount of\nthe deferred quarterly payments of interest, plus accrued interest thereon at an annual rate of 2.0%, compounded quarterly, and\nthe early exchange ratio will be 100% for the quarter following each deferral of a payment of quarterly interest. Once we have\npaid all deferred quarterly interest, plus accrued interest thereon, together with the quarterly interest payment for the current\nquarterly interest payment period, the contingent principal amount will reduce by the amount of that payment of deferred\nquarterly interest plus accrued interest thereon, the early exchange ratio will decrease to 95% and we can again defer quarterly\ninterest payments as described above. Instead of accruing cash interest on the ZONES during a quarterly deferral period, so long\nas the current market value of the reference shares exceeds the original principal amount of the ZONES, we may at our option,\nbut are not obligated to, increase the number of reference shares attributable to each ZONES by an annual rate of 2.0%. If we\nelect to make this increase, we will be deemed current on that quarterly payment of interest and will not increase the contingent\nprincipal amount, although the early exchange ratio will remain at 100% only for the five business days immediately following\nthe scheduled quarterly interest payment date related to the deferral. After that five day period, the early exchange ratio will\ndecrease to 95%. At the time we give notice that we intend to defer a quarterly payment of interest, we must elect to either accrue\ncash interest on the ZONES for that quarterly interest period or increase the number of reference shares attributable to the\nZONES, each as described above.\n\nIf we elect to defer interest on the ZONES in any particular quarter, we will give the trustee notice.
