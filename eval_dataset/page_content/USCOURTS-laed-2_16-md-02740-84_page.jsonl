ASC Industries, as it is unclear whether the 90-day period has\n\ncommenced.\n\n22 Generally, it is unclear whether counsel for the deceased plaintiffs may even oppose\nSanofi’s Motion (or otherwise file on behalf of the decedent). However, since counsel in this\nMDL have, at the direction of this Court, historically filed suggestions of death and motions\nto substitute (as they are likely the first parties to be apprised of the death of their clients)\nthe Court will consider the Oppositions. District courts disagree as whether an attorney for\na deceased plaintiff may file a suggestion of death on behalf of the deceased plaintiff. As\nJudge Duval in the Eastern District explained, “[i]t has been held that the attorney for the\ndeceased party may not make the suggestion of death since he is not himself a party to the\naction and, since his authority to represent the deceased terminates on the death, he is not a\n‘representative of the deceased party’ of the sort contemplated in the rule.” Behler v. Nautical\nOffshore, No. 03-1681, 2004 WL 2491612, at *1 (E.D. La. 2004) (quoting 7C WRIGHT, MILLER,\nKANE, & MARCUS, FED. PRAC. AND PROC. § 1955 at 545 (3d ed., April 2023 update)). Other\ndistrict courts have held the opposite. See, e.g., Jones v. Inlet Marina, Inc., 204 F.R.D. 238,\n240 (E.D. N.Y. Nov. 30, 2001) (noting that it “is permissible for the former attorney of the\ndecedent to file the suggestion of death, even though the attorney-client relationship ceased”).\nNotably, the MDL court in In re Aredia & Zometa issued a case management order requiring\ncounsel for the deceased plaintiffs to file a suggestion of death within 60 days of the death of\nthe plaintiff. No. 3:06-md-01760 (M.D. Tenn. July 28, 2006), ECF No. 89, 103. The order also\nmandated that the 90-day time period run from the initial filing of the suggestion of death—\nthereby modifying the deadline under Sampson. See id.\n\nThis Court agrees that, in the MDL context, counsel for the decedents should bear the\nburden of filing suggestions of death and locating representatives for the deceased, given the\nsheer number of cases and the need to streamline proceedings. Notably, at the July 11, 2023\nShow Cause Hearing, this Court ordered counsel for several deceased plaintiffs to file\nsuggestions of death and/or motions for substitution; counsel often responded that counsel\nwas in contact with the decedent’s heirs.

Brennan, the Fifth Circuit held that Rule 4 service on the executrix of\nan estate was required to grant a motion for substitution, even if the executrix had notice of\nthe motion for substitution. Sampson, 780 F.3d at 682 (citing Ransom, 437 F.2d at 519).\nHowever, with regard to whether service of the notice of the defendant’s death was ever\nperfected, the Ransom court simply stated that the defendant’s attorney suggested the\ndefendant’s death on the record. Sampson, 780 F.3d at 682-83 (citing Ransom, 437 F.2d at\n515). In distinguishing Ransom from the case before them, the Sampson court explained that\nwhile “the Ransom court seemed to accept that the deceased-defendant’s attorney properly\nsuggested the defendant's death, the issue of what constituted proper service for the notice\nof death was not before the court.” Id. The Sampson court also chastised the district court for\nmaking an “inferential leap” by way of assuming, (absent any evidence in the record), that\nno representative of the deceased defendant's estate was in existence when the suggestion\nwas filed, and therefore personal service was not required to trigger Rule 25’s 90-day time\nperiod.\n\n26 Likewise, no nonparties made an appearance to oppose Sanofi’s Motion.\n\n27 Rec.
