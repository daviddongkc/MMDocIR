We machine and assemble some  of the components used in our machines, engines and power  generation units and to support our after-market dealer parts  sales. We also purchase various goods and services used  in production, logistics, offices and product development  processes. We maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet  our global facilities’ production needs while building long-term  supplier relationships and leveraging enterprise spend. We  expect our suppliers to maintain, at all times, industry-leading  levels of quality and the ability to timely deliver raw materials  and component products for our machine and engine products.  However, in some cases, increases in demand or supply chain  disruptions have led to parts and components constraints across  some products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers  to protect our intellectual property and processes to monitor and  mitigate risks of the supply base causing a business disruption.  The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, the ability  to increase or decrease production levels, business continuity,  quality and delivery. \nPatents and Trademarks \nWe own a number of patents and trademarks, which have been  obtained over a period of years and relate to the products we  manufacture and the services we provide. These patents and  trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our business.  We do not regard our business as being dependent upon any single  patent or group of patents. \nOrder Backlog \nThe dollar amount of backlog believed to be firm was approximately   $\\S23.1$   billion at December 31, 2021 and  $\\S\\,14.2$   billion at December  31, 2020. Compared with year-end 2020, the order backlog  increased across the three primary segments, with the largest  increase in Energy & Transportation. Of the total backlog at  December 31, 2021, approximately  $\\S4.3$   billion was not expected  to be filled in 2022.  "}

Efforts\nto combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and\naccess to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally.\nCOVID 19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact\naround the world, prompting governments and businesses to\ntake unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have\nincluded travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place\norders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may\ncontinue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations\n\nHistorical information -\n\ne view/download on-line at www.Caterpillar.com/historical\n\nand the operations of our customers, dealers and suppliers.\nAlthough certain restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures\nand potential future measures.

The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly\nincreased economic and customer demand uncertainty, has\ncaused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere and has\ned to volatility in customer demand for the Company's products\nand services and caused supply chain disruptions. Economic\nuncertainties could continue to affect customer demand for the\nCompany's products and services, the value of the equipment\ninanced or leased, the demand for financing and the financial\ncondition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.\n\nContinued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration and\nersistent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect\nour business.

In  addition, the statements in this section and other sections of this  Form 10-K, including in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, ”  include “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined in  the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve  uncertainties that could significantly impact results. Forward-looking  statements give current expectations or forecasts of future events  about the company or our outlook.  You can identify forward-looking  statements by the fact they do not relate to historical or current facts  and by the use of words such as “believe, ” “expect, ” “estimate, ” \n\n “anticipate, ” “will be, ” “should, ” “plan, ” “forecast, ” “target, ” “guide, ” \n\n “project, ” “intend, ” “could” and similar words or expressions. \nForward-looking statements are based on assumptions and on  known risks and uncertainties. Although we believe we have  been prudent in our assumptions, any or all of our forward-looking  statements may prove to be inaccurate, and we can make  no guarantees about our future performance. Should known  or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize or underlying  assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could materially differ  from past results and/or those anticipated, estimated or projected. \nWe undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking  statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or  otherwise.  Y ou should, however, consult any subsequent disclosures  we make in our filings with the SEC on Form 10-Q or Form 8-K. \nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties  and assumptions that we believe are material to our business.  In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the  following are some of the important factors that, individually or  in the aggregate, we believe could make our actual results differ  materially from those described in any forward-looking statements.  It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result,  you should not consider the following factors to be a complete  discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions. \nRISKS RELATED TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic could materially adversely affect our business,  results of operations and/or financial condition. \nCOVID-19 was identified in late 2019 and spread globally. Efforts  to combat the virus have been complicated by viral variants and  access to, and acceptance and effectiveness of, vaccines globally.  COVID 19 has had, and continues to have, a significant impact  around the world, prompting governments and businesses to  take unprecedented measures in response. Such measures have  included travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place  orders and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may  continue to impact all or portions of our workforce and operations  \nHistorical information - \nz  view/download on-line at www.Caterpillar.com/historical \nand the operations of our customers, dealers and suppliers.  Although certain restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic  have eased, uncertainty continues to exist regarding such measures  and potential future measures. Current material and component  shortages, logistics constraints and labor inefficiencies have limited  and could continue to limit our ability to meet customer demand,  which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results  of operations and/or financial condition.  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused a global recession and the  sustainability of the economic recovery observed in 2021  remains unclear. The COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly  increased economic and customer demand uncertainty, has  caused inflationary pressure in the U.S. and elsewhere and has  led to volatility in customer demand for the Company’s products  and services and caused supply chain disruptions. Economic  uncertainties could continue to affect customer demand for the  Company’s products and services, the value of the equipment  financed or leased, the demand for financing and the financial  condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers. \nContinued uncertainties related to the magnitude, duration and  persistent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect  our business. These uncertainties include, among other things:  the duration and impact of the resurgence in COVID-19 cases in  any country, state, or region; the emergence, contagiousness,  and threat of new and different strains of the virus; the availability,  acceptance, and effectiveness of vaccines; prolonged reduction  or closure of the Company’s operations; disruptions in the supply  chain; labor inefficiencies; increased logistics costs; the impact of  the pandemic on the Company’s customers and dealers; the impact  of disruptions in the global capital markets and/or declines in our  financial performance or credit ratings, which could impact the  Company’s ability to obtain funding in the future; and the impact of  the pandemic on customer demand for our products and services as  discussed above. All of these factors could materially and adversely  affect our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. \nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s  financial and operational results will be determined by the length of  time that the pandemic continues, its effect on the demand for the  Company’s products and services and the supply chain, as well as  the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the  pandemic. The overall magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and  the continued fluidity of the situation could materially and adversely  impact our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. \nMACROECONOMIC RISKS \nOur business and the industries we serve are highly sensitive to global  and regional economic conditions. \nOur results of operations are materially affected by economic  conditions globally and regionally and in the particular industries  we serve. The demand for our products and services tends to be  cyclical and can be significantly reduced in periods of economic  weakness characterized by lower levels of government and business  investment, lower levels of business confidence, lower corporate  earnings, high real interest rates, lower credit activity or tighter  credit conditions, perceived or actual industry overcapacity, higher  unemployment and lower consumer spending. A prolonged period  of economic weakness may also result in increased expenses due  to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill  and asset impairment charges. Economic conditions vary across  regions and countries, and demand for our products and services  generally increases in those regions and countries experiencing  economic growth and investment. Slower economic growth or a  change in the global mix of regions and countries experiencing  economic growth and investment could have an adverse effect on  our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The credit worthiness of each customer and the  rate of delinquencies, repossessions and net losses on customer  obligations are directly impacted by several factors, including  relevant industry and economic conditions, the availability of capital,  the experience and expertise of the customer’s management team,  commodity prices, political events and the sustained value of the  underlying collateral. Any increase in delinquencies, repossessions  and net losses on customer obligations could have a material  adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our earnings and cash flows.  Cat Financial evaluates and adjusts its allowance for credit losses  related to past due and non-performing receivables on a regular  basis. However, adverse economic conditions or other factors that  might cause deterioration of the financial health of its customers  could change the timing and level of payments received and  necessitate an increase in Cat Financial’s estimated losses, which  could also have a material adverse effect on Cat Financial’s and our  earnings and cash flows. \nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations affect our results of operations. \nWe conduct operations in many countries involving transactions  denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to  currency-exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are  denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn  revenues. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had, and  will continue to have, an impact on our results as expressed in  U.S. dollars. There can be no assurance that currency exchange  rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations,  financial condition and cash flows. While the use of currency  hedging instruments may provide us with protection from  adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these  instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result  from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition,  our outlooks do not assume fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates from the date of  our outlooks could cause our actual results to differ materially  from those anticipated in any outlooks and adversely impact our  business, results of operations and financial condition.  \nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls  and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to  convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and  other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located  in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency  devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in  the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. \nRestrictive covenants in our debt agreements could limit our financial  and operating flexibility. \nWe maintain a number of credit facilities to support general  corporate purposes (facilities) and have issued debt securities  to manage liquidity and fund operations (debt securities). The  agreements relating to a number of the facilities and the debt  securities contain certain restrictive covenants applicable to us  and certain subsidiaries, including Cat Financial. These covenants  include maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth (defined as  the consolidated shareholder’s equity including preferred stock but  excluding the pension and other post-retirement benefits balance  within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)), limitations  on the incurrence of liens and certain restrictions on consolidation  and merger. Cat Financial has also agreed under certain of these  agreements not to exceed a certain leverage ratio (consolidated  debt to consolidated net worth, calculated (1) on a monthly basis  as the average of the leverage ratios determined on the last day of  each of the six preceding calendar months and (2) at each December  31), to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (profit excluding  income taxes, interest expense and net gain/(loss) from interest rate  derivatives to interest expense, calculated at the end of each calendar  quarter for the rolling four quarter period then most recently ended)  and not to terminate, amend or modify its support agreement with us. \nA breach of one or more of the covenants could result in adverse  consequences that could negatively impact our business, results  of operations and financial condition. These consequences may  include the acceleration of amounts outstanding under certain of the  facilities, triggering of an obligation to redeem certain debt securities,  termination of existing unused commitments by our lenders, refusal  by our lenders to extend further credit under one or more of the  facilities or to enter into new facilities or the lowering or modification  of our credit ratings or those of one or more of our subsidiaries. \nSustained increases in funding obligations under our pension plans  may impair our liquidity or financial condition. \nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for our  employees, which impose on us certain funding obligations. In  determining our future payment obligations under the plans, we  assume certain rates of return on the plan assets and a certain  level of future benefit payments. Significant adverse changes in  credit or capital markets could result in actual rates of return being  materially lower than projected and result in increased contribution  requirements. We expect to make contributions to our pension plans  in the future, and may be required to make contributions that could  be material. We may fund contributions through the use of cash on  hand, the proceeds of borrowings, shares of our common stock  or a combination of the foregoing, as permitted by applicable law.  These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations  under the plans, and as a result, adversely affect our business and  overall financial condition. \nLEGAL & REGULATORY RISKS \nOur global operations are subject to a wide-range of trade and  anti-corruption laws and regulations. \nDue to the international scope of our operations, we are subject  to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and  regulations. These include U.S. regulations issued by Customs  and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the  Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense  Trade  Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the  counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or  actual violations may subject us to increased government scrutiny,  investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability  to import or export our products or to provide services outside the  United States. Furthermore, embargoes and sanctions imposed  by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting sales  to specific persons or countries or based on product classification  may expose us to potential criminal and civil sanctions. We cannot  predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements  to which our operations might be subject.

The\nincrease was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable\nprice realization. Mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of\npension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plans, a\nlower effective tax rate, favorable impacts from foreign currency\nexchange (gains) losses and lower restructuring expenses were\nmostly offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher\nselling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and\ndevelopment (R&D) expenses.\n\nFourth-quarter 2021 sales and revenues were $13.798 billion, up\n$2.563 billion, or 23 percent, from $11.235 billion in the fourth\nquarter of 2020.

The increase was primarily due to higher  sales volume ,  driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and  services   and the impact from changes in  dealer inventories , along with  favorable  price realization . Profit per share was  $\\Updownarrow\\uparrow\\uparrow.83$  compared with profit per share of  $\\S5.46$   in 2020. Profit was   $\\S6.489$   billion in 2021, compared with  $\\S2.998$   billion in 2020. The  increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and favorable  price realization. Mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of  pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB)  plans, a  lower effective tax rate, favorable impacts from foreign  currency   exchange (gains) losses and lower restructuring expenses were  mostly offset by unfavorable  manufacturing costs  and higher  selling, general and administrative (SG&A) and research and  development (R&D) expenses. \nFourth-quarter 2021 sales and revenues were  $\\mathbb{S}13.798$   billion, up   $\\Updownarrow2.563$   billion, or 23 percent, from   $\\S\\uparrow\\uparrow.235$   billion in the fourth  quarter of 2020.

Fourth-quarter 2021 profit was  $\\mathbb{S}2.120$   billion, compared with   $\\Updownarrow780$   million in the fourth quarter of 2020. \nResponse to COVID-19 and Global Business Conditions: \nWe continue to monitor a variety of external factors including  the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic around the world  and have implemented safeguards in our facilities to protect  team members in line with local governmental requirements and  guidance from health authorities.  \n\nOperations continue to be impacted by a variety of external factors  including the pandemic, supply chain disruptions and associated  cost and labor pressures. Areas of particular focus include certain  components, transportation and raw materials. Transportation  shortages have resulted in delays and increased costs. In addition,  our suppliers are dealing with availability issues and freight delays,  which leads to delays of production in our facilities. We continue  to develop and modify contingency plans to minimize supply  chain challenges that may impact our ability to meet increasing  customer demand. To help mitigate supply chain challenges, we  have proactively redirected components and altered our assembly  processes. We continue to assess the environment and are taking  appropriate price actions in response to rising costs. We will  continue to monitor the situation as conditions remain fluid and  evolve, but we expect these challenges to continue this year. \nNotes: \nz  Glossary of terms included on pages 30-31; first occurrence of  terms shown in bold italics. z  Information on non-GAAP financial measures is included on  page 38. z  Some amounts within this report are rounded to the millions or  billions and may not add.

The decrease  from 2020 was primarily related to changes in the geographic  mix of profits from a tax perspective. \nThe provision for income taxes for the fourth quarter of 2021 also  included the following: \no\t A tax benefit of   $\\oint\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow$   million for the change from the  third-quarter estimated annual tax rate of 25 percent,  compared to a  $\\S96$   million benefit for the reduction in the  annual effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.  o\t A tax charge of  $\\S\\uparrow\\S0$   million related to  $\\S833$   million of pension  and OPEB mark-to-market gains in the fourth quarter of 2021,  compared to a  $\\S92$   million tax benefit related to  $\\S438$   million  of mark-to-market losses in the fourth quarter of 2020. o\t A tax benefit of   $\\S40$   million in the fourth quarter of 2021  primarily related to recognition of U.S. capital losses  compared to  $\\S28$   million in the fourth quarter of 2020 for  the settlement of stock-based compensation awards with  associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP  compensation expense.  \nConstruction Industries \nConstruction Industries’ total sales were  $\\S5.736$   billion in the  fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of  $\\Updownarrow228$   billion, or 27 percent,  compared with  $\\Updownarrow4.508$   billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The  increase was due to higher sales volume, driven by the impact from  changes in dealer inventories and higher end-user demand, along  with favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories more  during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter  of 2021. \nz  In North America, sales increased due to higher sales volume and  favorable price realization. Higher sales volume was driven by the  impact from changes in dealer inventories as dealers decreased  inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during  the fourth quarter of 2021. \nz  Sales increased in Latin America primarily due to higher sales  volume and favorable price realization. Higher sales volume was  \ndriven by higher end-user demand and the impact from changes  in dealer inventories. Dealers increased inventories during the  fourth quarter of 2021, compared to a decrease during the fourth  quarter of 2020. z  In EAME, sales increased due to higher sales volume from higher  end-user demand and the impact of changes in dealer inventories.  Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of  2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021. z  Sales decreased in Asia/Pacific primarily due to lower sales  volume, partially offset by favorable price realization. Decreased  sales volume reflected lower end-user demand, partially offset  by the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Lower sales  in China, driven by lower end-user demand, were partially  offset by higher sales across most of the rest of the region.  Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020,  compared to an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021. \nConstruction Industries’ profit was  $\\mathbb{S}788$   million in the fourth quarter  of 2021, an increase of  $\\mathbb{S}\\substack{\\uparrow58}$   million, or 25 percent, compared with   $\\S630$   million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher manufacturing  costs and SG&A/R&D expenses were more than offset by  higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Increased  manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden,  primarily freight, as well as higher material costs. \nThe increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was driven by higher  short-term incentive compensation expense. \nConstruction Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was \n\n 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with \n\n 14.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. \nResource Industries \nResource Industries’ total sales were   $\\Updownarrow2.762$   billion in the fourth  quarter of 2021, an increase of  $\\S582$   million, or 27 percent,  compared with  $\\S2.180$   billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The  increase was primarily due to higher sales volume, driven by  higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts, and  favorable price realization. End-user demand was higher in mining  as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. \nResource Industries’ profit was  $\\S305$   million in the fourth quarter  of 2021, an increase of  $\\S32$   million, or 12 percent, compared with   $\\mathbb{S}273$   million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing  costs and SG&A/R&D expenses were more than offset by  higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable  manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden,  primarily freight, and material costs. \nThe increase in SG&A/R&D expenses was driven by investments  aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher short-term  incentive compensation expense. \nResource Industries’ profit as a percent of total sales was \n\n 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with \n\n 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.

The increase was primarily due  to higher profit in 2021 adjusted for non-cash items, which included  higher accruals for short-term incentive compensation. In addition,  lower payments for short-term incentive compensation favorably  impacted cash flow. Partially offsetting these items were increased  working capital requirements. Within working capital, changes in  inventory and accounts receivable unfavorably impacted cash flow  but were partially offset by favorable changes in accounts payable  and accrued expenses. \nNet cash used for investing activities in 2021 was  $\\S\\uparrow.23$   billion,  compared with net cash used of  $\\S\\uparrow.34$   billion in 2020. The change  was primarily due to increased activity related to intercompany  lending with Financial Products, mostly offset by increased  investments in securities. During 2021, we invested  $\\Updownarrow\\!1.19$   billion in  bank time deposits with varying maturity dates within one year and  received proceeds from time deposits that matured of  $\\S225$   million.

In addition, we repurchased  $\\Updownarrow2.67$   billion of Caterpillar  common stock in 2021 compared to  $\\Updownarrow\\!1.13$  .13 billion in 2020. \nWhile our short-term priorities for the use of cash may vary  from time to time as business needs and conditions dictate, our  long-term cash deployment strategy is focused on the following  priorities. Our top priority is to maintain a strong financial position  in support of a Mid-A rating. Next, we intend to fund operational  requirements and commitments.  Then, we intend to fund priorities  that profitably grow the company and return capital to shareholders  through dividend growth and share repurchases. Additional  information on cash deployment is as follows: \nStrong financial position  — Our top priority is to maintain a  strong financial position in support of a mid-A rating. We track a  diverse group of financial metrics that focus on liquidity, leverage,  cash flow and margins which align with our cash deployment  actions and the various methodologies used by the major credit  rating agencies. \nOperational excellence and commitments  — Capital  expenditures were   $\\Updownarrow\\uparrow.\\uparrow3$   billion during 2021, compared to   $\\S994$   million in 2020.

By comparison, we  made  $\\S262$   million of contributions to our OPEB plans in 2020.  We expect to make approximately  $\\mathbb{S}357$   million of contributions  to our pension and OPEB plans in 2022.  \nFund strategic growth initiatives and return capital to  shareholders  — We intend to utilize our liquidity and debt  capacity to fund targeted investments that drive long-term  profitable growth focused in the areas of expanded offerings  and services, including acquisitions. \nand available for financing activities including debt repayments,  dividends and share repurchases. We define ME&T free cash  flow as cash from ME&T operations excluding discretionary  pension and other postretirement benefit plan contributions less  capital expenditures. A goal of our capital allocation strategy is  to return substantially all ME&T free cash flow to shareholders  over time in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while  maintaining our mid-A rating.  \nOur share repurchase plans are subject to the company’s cash  deployment priorities and are evaluated on an ongoing basis  considering the financial condition of the company and the  economic outlook, corporate cash flow, the company’s liquidity  needs and the health and stability of global credit markets. The  timing and amount of future repurchases may vary depending  on market conditions and investing priorities.

The more\nsignificant estimates include: residual values for leased assets, fair\nvalues for goodwill impairment tests, warranty liability, reserves\nfor product liability and insurance losses, postretirement benefits,\npost-sale discounts, credit losses and income taxes. We have\nincorporated many years of data into the determination of each of\nthese estimates and we have not historically experienced significant\nadjustments. We review these assumptions at least annually with\nthe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Following are the\nmethods and assumptions used in determining our estimates and\nan indication of the risks inherent in each.\n\nResidual values for leased assets — We determine the residual\nvalue of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated\nend-of-term market value. We estimate the residual value of leased\nequipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of\nfactors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past\nremarketing experience and any known significant market/\nproduct trends. We also consider the following critical factors in\nour residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand,\ntotal expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application,\nlocation, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees\nand contractual customer purchase options.\n\nUpon termination of the lease, the equipment is either purchased\nby the lessee or sold to a third party, in which case we may record\nagain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual\nvalue and the sale price.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For\noperating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense\nreflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a\nstraight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value\nadjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the\nremaining lease term.\n\nWe evaluate the carrying value of equipment on operating leases\nfor potential impairment when we determine a triggering event\nhas occurred. When a triggering event occurs, we perform a test\nfor recoverability by comparing projected undiscounted future\ncash flows to the carrying value of the equipment on operating\nleases. If the test for recoverability identifies a possible impairment,\nwe measure the fair value of the equipment on operating leases\nin accordance with the fair value measurement framework. We\nrecognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the\ncarrying value of the equipment on operating leases exceeds its\nestimated fair value.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the aggregate residual value of equipment\non operating leases was $1.87 billion. Without consideration of\nother factors such as third-party residual guarantees or contractual\ncustomer purchase options, a 10 percent non-temporary decrease\nin the market value of our equipment subject to operating leases\nwould reduce residual value estimates and result in the recognition\nof approximately $85 million of additional annual depreciation\nexpense.\n\nFair values for goodwill impairment tests —- We test goodwill for\nimpairment annually, at the reporting unit level, and whenever\nevents or circumstances make it more likely than not that an\nimpairment may have occurred, such as a significant adverse\nchange in the business climate or a decision to sell all or a portion\nof a reporting unit. We perform our annual goodwill impairment\ntest as of October 1 and monitor for interim triggering events on\nan ongoing basis.\n\nCATERPILLAR 2021 Form 10-«\n\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative\nassessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we\nchoose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the\nfair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further\nevaluation is necessary. For reporting units where we perform the\nquantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of\neach reporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income\napproach based on the present value of discounted cash flows, to\nthe respective carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we do not\nconsider the goodwill impaired. If the carrying value is higher than\nthe fair value, we recognize the difference as an impairment loss.\n\nFor reporting units where we perform a quantitative goodwill\nimpairment test, the process requires valuation of the respective\nreporting unit, which we primarily determine using an income\napproach based on a discounted five year forecasted cash flow\nwith a yearfive residual value. We compute the residual value using\nthe constant growth method, which values the forecasted cash\nflows in perpetuity. The assumptions about future cash flows and\ngrowth rates are based on each reporting unit's long-term forecast\nand are subject to review and approval by senior management. A\nreporting unit’s discount rate is a risk-adjusted weighted average\ncost of capital, which we believe approximates the rate from a\nmarket participant's perspective. The estimated fair value could\nbe impacted by changes in market conditions, interest rates,\ngrowth rates, tax rates, costs, pricing and capital expenditures. We\ncategorize the fair value determination as Level 3 in the fair value\nhierarchy due to its use of internal projections and unobservable\nmeasurement inputs.\n\nWe completed our annual assessment of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of 2021 and determined that there was no impairment\nof goodwill. Caterpillar’s market capitalization has remained\nsignificantly above the net book value of the Company.\n\nAn unfavorable change in our expectations for the financial\nperformance of our reporting units, particularly long-term growth\nand profitability, would reduce the fair value of our reporting\nunits. The demand for our equipment and related parts is highly\ncyclical and significantly impacted by commodity prices, although\nthe impact may vary by reporting unit. The energy and mining\nindustries are major users of our products, including the mineral\nextraction, oil and natural gas industries. Decisions to purchase our\nproducts are dependent upon the performance of those industries,\nwhich in turn are dependent in part on commodity prices. Lower\ncommodity prices or industry specific circumstances that have\na negative impact to the valuation assumptions may reduce the\nfair value of our reporting units. Should such events occur and\nit becomes more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value\nhas fallen below its carrying value, we will perform an interim\ngoodwill impairment test(s), in addition to the annual impairment\ntest. Future impairment tests may result in a goodwill impairment,\ndepending on the outcome of the quantitative impairment test.\nWe would report a goodwill impairment as a non-cash charge to\nearnings.\n\nWarranty liability - At the time we recognize a sale, we record\nestimated future warranty costs. We determine the warranty\nliability by applying historical claim rate experience to the current\nfield population and dealer inventory. Generally, we base historical\nclaim rates on actual warranty experience for each product by\nmachine model/engine size by customer or dealer location (inside\nor outside North America). We develop specific rates for each\nproduct shipment month and update them monthly based on\nactual warranty claim experience. Warranty costs may differ from\nthose estimated if actual claim rates are higher or lower than our\nhistorical rates.\n", "vlm_text": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  accepted accounting principles requires management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts.

Last year, similar assumptions\nand calculations yielded a minimal impact to 2021 pre-tax earnings.\n\nFor our Financial Products operations, we use interest rate derivative\ninstruments primarily to meet our match-funding objectives and\nstrategies. We have a match-funding policy that addresses the\ninterest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fixed or floating\nrate and duration) of our debt portfolio with the interest rate profile\nof our finance receivable portfolio within a predetermined range on\nan ongoing basis. In connection with that policy, we use interest\nrate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match\n\n38 CATERPILLAR 2021 Form 10-x\n\nassets within the finance receivable portfolio. Match funding\nreduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest\nrates move.\n\nn order to properly manage sensitivity to changes in interest rates,\nFinancial Products measures the potential impact of different\ninterest rate assumptions on pre-tax earnings. All on-balance sheet\nositions, including derivative financial instruments, are included in\nthe analysis. The primary assumptions included in the analysis are\nthat there are no new fixed rate assets or liabilities, the proportion\nof fixed rate debt to fixed rate assets remains unchanged and the\nevel of floating rate assets and debt remain constant. An analysis\nof the December 31, 2021 balance sheet, using these assumptions,\nestimates the impact of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained\nadverse change in interest rates to have a minimal impact on 2022\nre-tax earnings. Last year, similar assumptions and calculations\nyielded a minimal impact to 2021 pre-tax earnings.\n\nThis analysis does not necessarily represent our current outlook\nof future market interest rate movement, nor does it consider any\nactions management could undertake in response to changes in\ninterest rates. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that actual\nresults would be consistent with the results of our estimate.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nWe provide the following definitions for the non-GAAP financial\nmeasures used in this report. These non-GAAP financial measures\nhave no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and\ntherefore are unlikely to be comparable to the calculation of similar\nmeasures for other companies. Management does not intend\nthese items to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the\nrelated GAAP measures.\n\nWe believe it is important to separately quantify the profit impact\nof two significant items in order for our results to be meaningfu\nto our readers. These items consist of (i) pension and OPEB\nmark-to-market (gains) losses resulting from plan remeasurements\nand (ii) restructuring (income) costs, which were incurred to\ngenerate longerterm benefits. We do not consider these items\nindicative of earnings from ongoing business activities an\nbelieve the non-GAAP measures will provide investors with usefu\nperspective on underlying business results and trends and aid with\nassessing our period-overperiod results. In addition, we provide a\ncalculation of ME&T free cash flow as we believe it is an important\nmeasure for investors to determine the cash generation available\nfor financing activities including debt repayments, dividends an\nshare repurchases.\n\nReconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparabl\nGAAP measures are as follows:\n\nie\n", "vlm_text": "\nIn managing foreign currency risk for our Financial Products  operations, our objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting  from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency  balance sheet positions and future transactions denominated  in foreign currencies.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and\nExchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the\nconsolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures\nincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our\naudits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the\noverall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control  over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the  Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the  period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in  our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021,  based on criteria established in  Internal Control - Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the COSO. \nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over  financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying  Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated  financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm  registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with  respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to  error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the  consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures  included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our  audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the  overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an  understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating  the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other  procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance  of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide  reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with  generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with  authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection  of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections  of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in  conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements  that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that  $\\mathrm{(i)}$   relates to accounts or disclosures that are  material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The  communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole,  and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the  accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

This proposal is based on the IRS examination team’s application\nof the “substance-overform” or “assignment-of-income” judicial doctrines. As described by management, the Company is vigorously\ncontesting the proposed increases to tax and penalties for these years of approximately $2.3 billion, as management believes that the\n\nrelevant transactions complied with applicable tax laws and did not violate judicial doctrines. As disclosed by management, the\n\nurchase\n\nof parts by CSARL from unrelated parties and the subsequent sale of those parts to unrelated dealers outside the U.S. have substantial\nlegal, commercial, and economic consequences for the parties involved.

Financial\nProducts’ information relates to the financing to customers\nand dealers for the purchase and lease of Caterpillar and other\nequipment.\n\nWe sell our products primarily under the brands “Caterpillar,” “CAT,”\ndesign versions of “CAT” and “Caterpillar” “EMD,” “FG Wilson,”\n“Mak,” “MWM,\" “Perkins,” “Progress Rail)” “SEM” and “Solar\nTurbines.”\n\nWe conduct operations in our ME&T line of business under highly\ncompetitive conditions, including intense price competition.\nWe place great emphasis on the high quality and performance\nof our products and our dealers’ service support. Although no\none competitor is believed to produce all of the same types of\nequipment that we do, there are numerous companies, large and\nsmall, which compete with us in the sale of each of our products.\n\nWe distribute our machines principally through a worldwide\norganization of dealers (dealer network), 44 located in the United\nStates and 116 located outside the United States, serving 193\ncountries. We sell reciprocating engines principally through the\ndealer network and to other manufacturers for use in products.\nWe also sell some of the reciprocating engines manufactured by our\nsubsidiary Perkins Engines Company Limited through its worldwide\nnetwork of 90 distributors covering 171 countries. We sell the FG\nWilson branded electric power generation systems through its\nworldwide network of 110 distributors covering 109 countries. We\nalso sell some of the large, medium speed reciprocating engines\nunder the Mak brand through a worldwide network of 20 distributors\ncovering 130 countries. Our dealers do not deal exclusively with\nour products; however, in most cases sales and servicing of our\nproducts are the dealers’ principal business. We sell some products,\nprimarily turbines and locomotives, to end customers through sales\nforces employed by the company. At times, these employees are\nassisted by independent sales representatives.\n\nThe Financial Products line of business also conducts operations\nunder highly competitive conditions. Financing for users of\nCaterpillar products is available through a variety of competitive\nsources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing\ncompanies.

For VIEs, we assess whether we are\nthe primary beneficiary as prescribed by the accounting guidance\non the consolidation of VIEs. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is\nthe party that has both the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the entity’s economic performance and the\nobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. See Note 21 for further\niscussion on a consolidated VIE.\n\nCat Financial has end-user customers that are VIEs of which we are\nnot the primary beneficiary. Although we have provided financial\nsupport to these entities and therefore have a variable interest, we\njo not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly\nimpact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to\nloss from our involvement with these VIEs is limited to the credit\nrisk inherently present in the financial support that we have\nprovided. These risks were evaluated and reflected in our financial\nstatements as part of our overall portfolio of finance receivables\nand related allowance for credit losses.\n\nWe include shipping and handling costs in Cost of goods sold in\nStatement 1.

Foreign currency translation\n\nThe functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated\nsubsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of\nour Financial Products consolidated subsidiaries is the respective\nlocal currency. We include gains and losses resulting from the\nremeasurement of foreign currency amounts to the functional\ncurrency in Other income (expense) in Statement 1. We include\ngains and losses resulting from translating assets and liabilities\nfrom the functional currency to U.S. dollars in Accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) in Statement 3.\n\nF. Derivative financial instruments\n\nOur earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and\ncommodity prices. Our Risk Management Policy (policy) allows\nfor the use of derivative financial instruments to prudently manage\nforeign currency exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price\nexposures. Our policy specifies that derivatives are not to be used\nfor speculative purposes. Derivatives that we use are primarily\nforeign currency forward, option and cross currency contracts,\ninterest rate contracts and commodity forward and option\ncontracts. All derivatives are recorded at fair value. See Note 4 for\nmore information.\n\nG. Income taxes\n\nWe determine the provision for income taxes using the asset and\nliability approach taking into account guidance related to uncertain\ntax positions. Tax laws require items to be included in tax filings\nat different times than the items are reflected in the financial\nstatements. We recognize a current liability for the estimated taxes\npayable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future\ntax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts\nof assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. We adjust deferred\ntaxes for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. We record\nvaluation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more\nlikely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. See Note 6 for\nfurther discussion.\n\nH. Goodwill\n\nFor acquisitions accounted for as a business combination,\ngoodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value\nof the net assets acquired. We are required to test goodwill\nfor impairment, at the reporting unit level, annually and when\nevents or circumstances make it more likely than not that an\n\n54 CATERPILLAR’ 2021 For 10-k\n\nimpairment may have occurred. A reporting unit is an operating\nsegment or one level below an operating segment (referred to\nas a component) to which goodwill is assigned when initially\nrecorded. We assign goodwill to reporting units based on our\nintegration plans and the expected synergies resulting from the\nacquisition. Because Caterpillar is a highly integrated company,\nthe businesses we acquire are sometimes combined with or\nintegrated into existing reporting units. When changes occur in\nthe composition of our operating segments or reporting units,\nwe reassign goodwill to the affected reporting units based on\ntheir relative fair values.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1\nand monitor for interim triggering events on an ongoing basis.\nWe review goodwill for impairment utilizing either a qualitative\nassessment or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we\nchoose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine\nthe fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value,\nno further evaluation is necessary. For reporting units where\nwe perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we\ncompare the fair value of each reporting unit, which we primarily\njetermine using an income approach based on the present value\nof discounted cash flows, to the respective carrying value, which\nincludes goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds\nits carrying value, we do not consider the goodwill impaired.\nthe carrying value is higher than the fair value, we would\nrecognize the difference as an impairment loss. See Note 10\nfor further details.\n\nI. Estimates in financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica requires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates\ninclude: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill\nimpairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product liability\nand insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts,\ncredit losses and income taxes.\n\nJ. New accounting guidance\n\nA. Adoption of new accounting standards\n\nReference rate reform (Accounting Standards Update\n(ASU) 2020-04) — In March 2020, the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance to\nease the potential burden in accounting for reference\nrate reform related activities that impact debt, leases,\nderivatives and other contracts. The guidance is optional\nand may be elected over time as reference rate reform\nactivities occur between March 12, 2020 through\nDecember 31, 2022. In January 2021, we elected to adopt\noptional expedients impacting our derivative instruments.\nIn addition, in October 2021, we elected to adopt optional\nexpedients for contract modifications. Our adoption of the\noptional expedients did not have a material impact on our\nfinancial statements.\n", "vlm_text": "\nE.\t Foreign currency translation \nThe functional currency for most of our ME&T consolidated  subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for most of  our Financial Products consolidated subsidiaries is the respective  local currency.

If the carrying value is higher than the fair value, we would  recognize the difference as an impairment loss. See Note 10  for further details. \nI.\t Estimates in financial statements \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of  America requires management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect reported amounts. The more significant estimates  include: residual values for leased assets; fair values for goodwill  impairment tests; warranty liability and reserves for product liability  and insurance losses, postretirement benefits, post-sale discounts,  credit losses and income taxes. \nJ.\t New accounting guidance \nA.  Adoption of new accounting standards \nReference rate reform  (Accounting Standards Update  (ASU) 2020-04) – In March 2020, the Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) issued accounting guidance to  ease the potential burden in accounting for reference  rate reform related activities that impact debt, leases,  derivatives and other contracts. The guidance is optional  and may be elected over time as reference rate reform  activities occur between March 12, 2020 through  December 31, 2022. In January 2021, we elected to adopt  optional expedients impacting our derivative instruments.  In addition, in October 2021, we elected to adopt optional  expedients for contract modifications. Our adoption of the  optional expedients did not have a material impact on our  financial statements. "}

Sales and revenue recognition\n\nA. Sales of Machinery, Energy & Transportation\n\nWe recognize sales of ME&T when all th\nsatisfied: (i) a contract with an in\n\ne following criteria are\n\nlependently owned and operated\n\ndealer or an end user exists which has commercial substance; (ii)\n\nit is probable we will collect the amount cl\nend user; and (iii) we have completed our\n\narged to the dealer or\nperformance obligation\n\nExcept for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale\nof our products. We estimate replacement part returns based on\nhistorical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents\nour right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned.\nWe also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in\n\nwhereby the dealer or end user has obtained control of the product.\nA contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and\n\nStatement 3 for the refund we expect to\n\npay for returned parts.\n\nIf actual replacement part returns differ from those estimated,\n\naccept a purchase order under a dealer sai\n\nles agreement, or once\n\nwe enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not\n\nprobable, the sale is deferred an\n\nnot recognized until collection is\n\nprobable or payment is received.

Our invoice terms for end user sales are established by the\nresponsible business unit. Payments from dealers are due shortly\nafter the time of sale. When we make a sale to a dealer, the dealer\nis responsible for payment even if the product is not sold to an\nend user. Dealers and end users must make payment within the\n\nestablished invoice terms to avoid potentia\n\ninterest costs. Interest\n\nOur remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the\nremanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related\nproducts. In this business, we inspect, clean and remanufacture used\nengines and related components (core). In connection with the sale\nof our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that\nis repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified\ntime period. Caterpillar owns and has title to the cores when they\nare returned from dealers. The rebuilt engine or component (the\ncore plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product\nto dealers and end users. We recognize revenue pursuant to the\nsame transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above. At\nthe time of sale, we recognize the deposit in Other current liabilities\nin Statement 3, and we recognize the core to be returned as an\nasset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3\nat the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience\nwith usable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay\nthe deposit and relieve the liability. We then transfer the returned\ncore asset into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited\n(i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the\nspecified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost\nof the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively.\n\nWe provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs.\nWe have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of\nour products. The most common dealer programs provide a discount\nwhen the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. Generally, we\nestimate the cost of these discounts for each product by model by\ngeographic region based on historical experience and known changes\nin merchandising programs. We report the cost of these discounts\nas a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the\nproduct sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve\nin Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on\nunits sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, we report\nthe difference as a change in the transaction price.\n\nat or above prevailing market rates may be charged on any past due\nbalance, and generally our practice is to not forgive this interest. In\naddition, Cat Financial provides wholesale inventory financing for a\ndealer's purchase of inventory. Wholesale inventory receivables have\nvarying payment terms. We include wholesale inventory receivables\nin Receivables — trade and other and Long-term receivables — trade\nand other in Statement 3.

During 2021, we\nrecognized $903 million of revenue that was recorded as a contract\niability at the beginning of 2021. During 2020, we recognized $1,012\nmillion of revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the\neginning of 2020.\n\nWe have elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of\nrevenue to be recognized under a contract with a dealer or end user\nor the effects of time value of money when the timing difference\netween receipt of payment and recognition of revenue is less\nthan one year.\n\nCATERPILLAR’ 2021 Form 10-k\n\n55\n", "vlm_text": "2020-01 2020-08 2021-01 \nDescription \nInvestments - Equity securities, equity method and joint ventures and derivatives and hedging Codification improvements - Receivables - Nonrefundable fees and other costs Reference rate reform - Scope \nB.  Accounting standards issued but not yet adopted \nWe consider the applicability and impact of all ASUs.

A contract with commercial substance exists once we receive and  accept a purchase order under a dealer sales agreement, or once  we enter into a contract with an end user. If collectibility is not  probable, the sale is deferred and not recognized until collection is  probable or payment is received. Control of our products typically  transfers when title and risk of ownership of the product has  transferred to the dealer or end user. Typically, where product is  produced and sold in the same country, title and risk of ownership  transfer when we ship the product. Products that are exported  from a country for sale typically transfer title and risk of ownership  at the border of the destination country.  \nOur remanufacturing operations are primarily focused on the  remanufacture of Cat engines and components and rail related  products. In this business, we inspect, clean and remanufacture used  engines and related components (core). In connection with the sale  of our remanufactured product to dealers, we collect a deposit that  is repaid if the dealer returns an acceptable core within a specified  time period.

The rebuilt engine or component (the  core plus any new content) is then sold as a remanufactured product  to dealers and end users. We recognize revenue pursuant to the  same transfer of control criteria as ME&T sales noted above. At  the time of sale, we recognize the deposit in Other current liabilities  in Statement 3, and we recognize the core to be returned as an  asset in Prepaid expenses and other current assets in Statement 3  at the estimated replacement cost (based on historical experience  with usable cores). Upon receipt of an acceptable core, we repay  the deposit and relieve the liability. We then transfer the returned  core asset into inventory. In the event that the deposit is forfeited  (i.e., upon failure by the dealer to return an acceptable core in the  specified time period), we recognize the core deposit and the cost  of the core in Sales and Cost of goods sold, respectively. \nWe provide discounts to dealers through merchandising programs.  We have numerous programs that are designed to promote the sale of  our products.  The most common dealer programs provide a discount  when the dealer sells a product to a targeted end user. Generally, we  estimate the cost of these discounts for each product by model by  geographic region based on historical experience and known changes  in merchandising programs. We report the cost of these discounts  as a reduction to the transaction price when we recognize the  product sale. We accrue a corresponding post-sale discount reserve  in Statement 3, which represents discounts we expect to pay on  units sold. If discounts paid differ from those estimated, we report  the difference as a change in the transaction price. \nExcept for replacement parts, no right of return exists on the sale  of our products. We estimate replacement part returns based on  historical experience and recognize a parts return asset in Prepaid  expenses and other current assets in Statement 3, which represents  our right to recover replacement parts we expect will be returned.  We also recognize a refund liability in Other current liabilities in  Statement 3 for the refund we expect to pay for returned parts.

In  addition, Cat Financial provides wholesale inventory financing for a  dealer’s purchase of inventory. Wholesale inventory receivables have  varying payment terms. We include wholesale inventory receivables  in Receivables – trade and other and Long-term receivables – trade  and other in Statement 3. See Note 7 for further information.  We recognize trade receivables from dealers and end users in  Receivables - trade and other and Long-term receivables trade and  other in Statement 3. Trade receivables from dealers and end users  were  $\\mathbb{S7,267}$  ,267 million,  $^{\\S6,310}$   million and  $\\mathbb{S7648}$  ,648 million as of December  31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Our allowance for credit losses is not significant. \nWe invoice in advance of recognizing the sale of certain products.  We recognize advanced customer payments as a contract liability  in Customer advances and Other liabilities in Statement 3.

Stock-based compensation\n\nOur stock-based compensation plans primarily provide for the\ngranting of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and\nperformance-based restricted stock units (PRSUs) to Officers and\nother key employees, as well as non-employee Directors. Stock\noptions permit a holder to buy Caterpillar stock at the stock's price\nwhen the option was granted. RSUs are agreements to issue\nshares of Caterpillar stock at the time of vesting.

Our objective is to minimize the cost of borrowed funds.  Our policy allows us to enter into fixed-to-floating interest rate  contracts and forward rate agreements to meet that objective.  We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as fair value  hedges at inception of the contract, and we designate certain  forward rate agreements as cash flow hedges at inception of the  contract. \n\nFinancial Products operations has a match-funding policy that  addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile  (fixed or floating rate and duration) of Cat Financial’s debt portfolio  with the interest rate profile of our receivables portfolio within  predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis. In connection with  that policy, we use interest rate derivative instruments to modify  the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio.  This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between  interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless  of which direction interest rates move. \nOur policy allows us to use fixed-to-floating, floating-to-fixed and  floating-to-floating interest rate contracts to meet the match-funding  objective. We designate fixed-to-floating interest rate contracts as  fair value hedges to protect debt against changes in fair value due  to changes in the benchmark interest rate. We designate most  floating-to-fixed interest rate contracts as cash flow hedges to  protect against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the  benchmark interest rate. \nWe have, at certain times, liquidated fixed-to-floating and floating-to- fixed interest rate contracts at both ME&T and Financial Products.  We amortize the gains or losses associated with these contracts  at the time of liquidation into earnings over the original term of the  previously designated hedged item. \nC.\t Commodity price risk \nCommodity price movements create a degree of risk by affecting  the price we must pay for certain raw materials. Our policy is to use  commodity forward and option contracts to manage the commodity  risk and reduce the cost of purchased materials. \nOur ME&T operations purchase base and precious metals  embedded in the components we purchase from suppliers. Our  suppliers pass on to us price changes in the commodity portion of  the component cost. In addition, we are subject to price changes  on energy products such as natural gas and diesel fuel purchased  for operational use. \nOur objective is to minimize volatility in the price of these  commodities. Our policy allows us to enter into commodity forward  and option contracts to lock in the purchase price of a portion of  these commodities within a five-year horizon. All such commodity  forward and option contracts are undesignated. "}

Allowance for credit losses\n\nPortfolio segments\n\nA portfolio segment is the level at which Cat Financial develops a\nsystematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit\nlosses. Cat Financial's portfolio segments and related methods for\nestimating expected credit losses are as follows:\n\nCustomer\n\nCat Financial provides loans and finance leases to end-user\ncustomers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used\nCaterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use,\nthe majority of which operate in construction-related industries. Cat\nFinancial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation\nfacilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate\nCaterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial's\ncustomer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 50 months\nwith an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n\nCat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed\nequipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on\nthe financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with\ncertain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts\nfail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally\ncan repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal\nrequirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or\nthrough third-party auctions.\n\nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to\nits customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models\nutilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default\nbased on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions\nand reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and\nindustry-specific economic factors.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Cat Financial’s\nforecasts for the markets in which it operates reflected a general\nimprovement in economic conditions, which had deteriorated due\nto the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from a growing economy,\nimproved unemployment rates and a decrease in delinquencies.\nThe company believes the economic forecasts employed represent\nreasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to\nlong-term trends.\n\nDealer\n\nCat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form\nof wholesale financing plans. Cat Financial’s wholesale financing\nlans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new\nCaterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and\nunsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of\nsecured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\n\nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer\ninance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration\nof current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable\norecasts.\n\nn general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not\nistorically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses\nased on changes in economic conditions due to its close working\nrelationships with the dealers and their financial strength.

Cat Financial’s portfolio segments and related methods for  estimating expected credit losses are as follows: \nCustomer \nCat Financial provides loans and finance leases to end-user  customers primarily for the purpose of financing new and used  Caterpillar machinery, engines and equipment for commercial use,  the majority of which operate in construction-related industries. Cat  Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation  facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate  Caterpillar products. The average original term of Cat Financial’s  customer finance receivable portfolio was approximately 50 months  with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of  December 31, 2021. \nCat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed  equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on  the financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with  certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial’s collection efforts  fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally  can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal  requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or  through third-party auctions. \nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to  its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models  utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default  based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and  industry-specific economic factors. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Cat Financial’s  forecasts for the markets in which it operates reflected a general  improvement in economic conditions, which had deteriorated due  to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from a growing economy,  improved unemployment rates and a decrease in delinquencies.  The company believes the economic forecasts employed represent  reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to  long-term trends. \nDealer \nCat Financial provides financing to Caterpillar dealers in the form  of wholesale financing plans. Cat Financial’s wholesale financing  plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new  Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and  unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of  secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers. \nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses for dealer  finance receivables based on historical loss rates with consideration  of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable  forecasts. \nIn general, Cat Financial’s Dealer portfolio segment has not  historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses  based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working  relationships with the dealers and their financial strength.  Therefore,  Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during  the year ended December 31, 2021. \nClasses of finance receivables \nCat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class  of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information  (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have  the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for  assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial’s classes, which  align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows: \nz  North America  - Finance receivables originated in the  United States and Canada. "}

Our defined benefit pension plans provide a benefit  based on years of service and/or the employee’s average earnings  near retirement. Our defined contribution plans allow employees  to contribute a portion of their salary to help save for retirement,  and in most cases, we provide a matching contribution.  The benefit  obligation related to our non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are  for employees located primarily in Europe, Japan and Brazil.

This rate represents 3 percent general inflation plus 2 percent  additional health care inflation. \nC.\t Expected contributions and benefit payments \nThe following table presents information about expected contributions and benefit payments for pension and other postretirement benefit  plans: \nThe table provides a breakdown of expected employer contributions and expected benefit payments from 2022 to 2031, expressed in millions of dollars.\n\n**Expected Employer Contributions for 2022:**\n- U.S. Pension Benefits: $46 million\n- Non-U.S. Pension Benefits: $55 million\n- Other Postretirement Benefits: $256 million\n\n**Expected Benefit Payments:**\n- **U.S. Pension Benefits:**\n  - 2022: $1,035 million\n  - 2023: $1,020 million\n  - 2024: $1,020 million\n  - 2025: $1,020 million\n  - 2026: $1,020 million\n  - 2027-2031: $4,960 million\n  - Total: $10,075 million\n\n- **Non-U.S. Pension Benefits:**\n  - 2022: $210 million\n  - 2023: $175 million\n  - 2024: $180 million\n  - 2025: $185 million\n  - 2026: $195 million\n  - 2027-2031: $1,045 million\n  - Total: $1,990 million\n\n- **Other Postretirement Benefits:**\n  - 2022: $275 million\n  - 2023: $270 million\n  - 2024: $265 million\n  - 2025: $260 million\n  - 2026: $260 million\n  - 2027-2031: $1,250 million\n  - Total: $2,580 million\n\n**Expected Medicare Part D Subsidy:**\n- 2022: $7 million\n- 2023: $7 million\n- 2024: $7 million\n- 2025: $7 million\n- 2026: $6 million\n- 2027-2031: $26 million\n- Total: $60 million\nThe above table reflects the total expected employer contributions  and expected benefits to be paid from the plan or from company  assets and does not include the participants’ share of the cost.  The  expected benefit payments for our other postretirement benefits  include payments for prescription drug benefits. The above table  also includes Medicare Part D subsidy amounts expected to be  received by the company which will offset other postretirement  benefit payments. \nD.\t Plan assets \nIn general, our strategy for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pensions  includes ongoing alignment of our investments to our liabilities, while  reducing risk in our portfolio. The current U.S. pension target asset  allocation is 85 percent fixed income and 15 percent equities. We will  revise this target allocation periodically to ensure it reflects our overall  objectives.  The non-U.S. pension weighted-average target allocations  are 82 percent fixed income, 10 percent equities, 5 percent real estate  and 3 percent other. The target allocations for each plan vary based  upon local statutory requirements, demographics of plan participants  and funded status. We primarily invest the non-U.S. plan assets in  non-U.S. securities. \nOur target allocation for the other postretirement benefit plans is 70  percent equities and 30 percent fixed income. \nWe rebalance the U.S. plans to within the appropriate target asset  allocation ranges on a monthly basis. The frequency of rebalancing  for the non-U.S. plans varies depending on the plan. As a result of our  diversification strategies, there are no significant concentrations of  risk within the portfolio of investments. \n\nWe permit the use of certain derivative instruments where appropriate  and necessary for achieving overall investment policy objectives. The  plans do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. \nThe accounting guidance on fair value measurements specifies  a fair value hierarchy based upon the observability of inputs used  in valuation techniques (Level 1, 2 and 3). Certain assets that  are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share  (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified  in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 18 for a discussion of the  fair value hierarchy. \nWe determine fair values as follows: \nz  Equity securities are primarily based on valuations for identical  instruments in active markets. z  Fixed income securities are primarily based upon models that  take into consideration such market-based factors as recent  sales, risk-free yield curves and prices of similarly rated bonds. z  Real estate is stated at the fund’s net asset value or at appraised  value. z  Cash, short-term instruments and other are based on the carrying  amount, which approximates fair value, or the fund’s net asset  value.

These investments have a maturity of less than one year and are  recorded at amortized costs, which approximate fair value.  \nIn addition, Insurance Services has an equity investment in a real  estate investment trust (REIT) which is recorded at fair value based  on the net asset value (NAV) of the investment and is not classified  within the fair value hierarchy. \nSee Note 11 for additional information on our investments in debt  and equity securities. \nDerivative financial instruments \nThe fair value of interest rate contracts is primarily based on a  standard industry accepted valuation model that utilizes the  appropriate market-based forward swap curves and zero-coupon  interest rates to determine discounted cash flows.  The fair value of  foreign currency and commodity forward, option and cross currency  contracts is based on standard industry accepted valuation models  that discount cash flows resulting from the differential between the  contract price and the market-based forward rate. \nSee Note 4 for additional information.

The company generally enters  into International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master  netting agreements within ME&T and Financial Products that  permit the net settlement of amounts owed under their respective  derivative contracts. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of  nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains  that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received  cash payment.

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales- type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered  to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat  Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating  or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending  on the characteristics of the lease. For tax purposes, Cat Financial is  considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may  include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the  end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.  \nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial’s leased equipment  based on its estimated end-of-term market value. We estimate the  residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease  based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market  sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant  market/product trends. We also consider the following critical  factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size  and demand, total expected hours of usage, machine configuration,  application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual  guarantees and contractual customer purchase options. \n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values. For  operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense  reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a  straight-line basis. For finance leases, we recognize residual value  adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the  remaining lease term. \nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables  (sales-type and direct finance leases).  \nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating  leases was as follows: \nThe table presents financial data in millions of dollars for equipment leased to others as of December 31 for the years 2021 and 2020. \n\n- **Equipment leased to others - at original cost**: \n  - 2021: $5,733 million\n  - 2020: $6,077 million\n\n- **Less: Accumulated depreciation**: \n  - 2021: $(1,870) million\n  - 2020: $(2,035) million\n\n- **Equipment leased to others - net**: \n  - 2021: $3,863 million\n  - 2020: $4,042 million\nThe table presents financial data related to revenues generated from finance and operating leases.

Headquartered near Fort Worth,  Texas, SPM Oil & Gas produces a full line of pumps, flow iron,  consumable parts, wellhead and pressure control products that  are offered via an extensive global network of service centers.  This  acquisition, included in the Energy & Transportation segment, is  consistent with our strategy of providing our customers expanded  offerings and services which will now be one of the broadest in  the well service industry. The purchase price, net of  $\\S22$   million of  acquired cash, was approximately   $\\S359$   million. \nWe financed the transaction with available cash. Tangible assets  as of the acquisition date were  $\\S520$   million, recorded at their fair  values, and primarily included cash of  $\\S22$   million, receivables  of   $\\mathbb{S}\\,\\mathbb{106}$   million, inventories of  $\\mathbb{S}\\,\\uparrow\\,59$   million, leased assets of   $\\mathbb{S}\\,\\mathbb{105}$   million, and property, plant, and equipment of  $\\S\\uparrow\\uparrow\\uparrow$   million.  Finite-lived intangible assets acquired of  $\\S23$   million included  developed technology and trade names and will be amortized on  a straight-line basis over a weighted-average amortization period  of approximately 8 years. Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition  date were  $\\S\\uparrow\\S2$   million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily  included lease liabilities of   $\\S\\,105$   million and accounts payable of   $\\S33$   million. Goodwill of  $\\S30$   million represented the excess of the  consideration transferred over the net assets acquired.
