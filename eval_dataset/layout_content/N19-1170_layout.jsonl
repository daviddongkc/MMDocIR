Through our evaluation, we showed that a good conversa- tion is about balance – controlling for the right level of repetition, speciﬁcity and question-asking is important for overall quality. We also found that conversational aspects such as interestingness, listening, and inquisitiveness are all important – though optimizing these can introduce a trade-off against certain types of errors (such as repetitive, disﬂuent, or nonsensical output). Secondly, multi- turn evaluation is essential to study what makes a good conversation – multiple turns are required to reveal issues such as repetition, consistency, and question-asking frequency. Lastly, what do we mean by ‘good’? Although humanness and engag- ingness are both commonly used as overall qual- ity metrics, the two are very different. While our models achieved close-to-human scores on engag- ingness, they failed to get close on humanness – showing that a chatbot need not be human-like to be enjoyable. This striking result also demon- strates the importance of measuring more than one quality metric when evaluating dialogue agents.

Each model or control technique is assessed across several dimensions: Avoiding Repetition, Engage, Fluency, Humanness, Inquisitive, Interesting, Listening, and Make Sense. The values for each metric appear to be mean scores with standard deviations given as ± values.\n\nA few observations and highlights:\n- The \"Human\" model generally scores highest or among the highest across metrics, particularly in Humanness, Interesting, and Listening.\n- Greedy Search and Beam Search have lower scores compared to the Human model, especially in metrics such as Engage, Humanness, and Interesting.\n- Among the model control techniques, several specific models (e.g., \"Specificity-controlled WD 4\") are marked with an asterisk (*), possibly indicating a baseline or noteworthy variant within each category.\n- Question control CT 0 has notably high Engage scores, while Specificity-controlled WD variants (some marked with an asterisk) show balanced scores across the board.\n- The models aim to achieve different objectives, such as minimizing repetition or improving engagement, and the table serves to compare their effectiveness quantitatively."}
