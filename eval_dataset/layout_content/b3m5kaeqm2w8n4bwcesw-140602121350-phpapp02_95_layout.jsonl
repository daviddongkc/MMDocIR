It likely includes information about different types of UV rays such as UVA, UVB, and UVC, and explains their respective effects on the skin. The infographic is designed to illustrate how these ultraviolet rays from the sun impact human skin, with likely a focus on aspects such as skin damage or the potential for causing skin cancer. The image also appears to have sections possibly indicating the wavelengths of each type of UV ray and might include a diagram of the sun emitting these rays toward Earth."}
