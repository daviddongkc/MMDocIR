The purpose of the report – the intended  audience for which was not only the Secretary of State, but also  the State Department, the American public, and international  readers of various stripes – was not to discover new principles  as much as to restate and clarify confusion regarding older  ones that had been lost to what Abraham Lincoln referred to  “the silent artillery of time.” In other words, the report would  be “a return to basics,” but supplemented with fresh and  penetrating insights.

The State and USAID request is for   $\\S27.6$   billion to support all core programs; no OCO funding \n is requested. The Department of State-managed accounts sum  to   $\\S11.7$   billion or 42 percent of the total request. \nI mpact   of  COVID-19 \nIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  global pandemic, the Department of State has taken decisive  action to inform and safeguard U.S. citizens overseas, protect  the homeland, advance the Administration’s commitment to  building global health security capacity for this and future  outbreaks, and reduce the impact for U.S. companies and  supply chains overseas. As of June 2020, the Department \n had coordinated the repatriations of 100,000 American  citizens as part of the U.S. Government’s efforts to combat  COVID-19 and protect American citizens abroad.  \nResources were mobilized to support these efforts. The  Department’s 2020 funding provided for Diplomatic  Engagement included  $\\S588$   million in cumulative  supplemental funding appropriated for COVID-19 \n response. The   $\\S588$   million in 2020 supplemental funding  was provided to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the  coronavirus pandemic. These funds were used to provide  critical support to American citizens overseas and maintain  consular operations in light of declining visa and passport  revenues, and increase the Department’s global capacity for  medical response, diagnosis, treatment, and evacuations.

Individual SoAs from Ambassadors  assigned overseas and Assistant Secretaries in Washington, D.C.  serve as the primary basis for the Department’s FMFIA SoA  issued by the Secretary. The SoAs are based on information  gathered from various sources including managers’ personal  knowledge of day-to-day operations and existing controls,  management program reviews, and other management-initiated  evaluations. In addition, the Office of Inspector General, the  Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction,  \nand the Government Accountability Office conduct reviews,  audits, inspections, and investigations that are considered by  management. \nThe Senior Assessment Team (SAT) provided oversight during  2020 for the internal controls over reporting program in place  to meet Appendix A to OMB Circular A-123 requirements.  The SAT reports to the MCSC and is comprised of 14 senior  executives from bureaus that have significant responsibilities  relative to the Department’s financial resources, processes, and  reporting. The SAT also includes executives from the Office  of the Legal Adviser and the Office of Inspector General  (non-voting). The Department employs a risk-based approach  in evaluating internal controls over reporting on a multi-year  rotating basis, which has proven to be efficient. Due to the  broad knowledge of management involved with the Appendix  A assessment, along with the extensive work performed by the  Office of Management Controls, the Department evaluated  issues on a detailed level.  \nThe Department’s management controls program is designed  to ensure full compliance with the goals, objectives, and  \nThe image is a flowchart illustrating the FMFIA (Federal Managers' Financial Integrity Act) Annual Assurance Process.

The  Constitution translates the universal promise of fundamental  rights belonging to all persons into the distinctive positive law  of the American republic. \nAccording to the Preamble, the Constitution’s aims are manifold:  “We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more  perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility,  provide for the common defence, promote the general  Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and  our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for  the United States of America.” In seven austere articles, the  original Constitution – the drafting and ratification of which  were themselves extraordinary acts of self-government sets  forth institutional arrangements that enabled the people to  rule themselves while respecting freedom and equality. \nThe primary means by which the Constitution enables the people  to secure those blessings is through the structure it gives to, and  the limitations it imposes on, government. Limited government is  crucial to the protection of unalienable rights because majorities  are inclined to impair individual freedom, and public officials are  prone to putting their private preferences and partisan ambitions  ahead of the public interest. This is not to deny the capacity for  public-spirited action on the part of the people or public officials,  but to recognize the need for institutional safeguards for rights  because of the unreliability of high-minded motives. Nor is it to  overlook that, within its limits, government must act energetically  and effectively to secure rights. \nThis image is a historical painting depicting three men in colonial-era clothing. They appear to be engaged in discussion, with one seated and holding a document. The setting suggests a formal or important meeting.

A political society that  destroys the possibility of either loses its legitimacy. \nFor the founders, property refers not only to physical goods and  the fruit of one’s labor but also encompasses life, liberty, and  the pursuit of happiness. They assumed, following philosopher  John Locke, that the protection of property rights benefits all  by increasing the incentive for producing goods and delivering  services desired by others.  \nThe benefits of property rights, though, are not only pecuniary.  Protection of property rights is also central to the effective  exercise of positive rights and to the pursuit of happiness in  family, community, and worship. Without the ability to maintain  control over one’s labor, goods, land, home, and other material  possessions, neither can one enjoy individual rights, nor can  society build a common life. Moreover, the choices we make  about what and how to produce, exchange, distribute, and  consume can be tightly bound up with the kinds of human  beings we wish to become. Not least, the right of private  property sustains a sphere generally off limits to government, a  sphere in which individuals, their families, and the communities  they form can pursue happiness in peace and prosperity. \nThe importance that the founders attached to private property  only compounds the affront to unalienable rights involved at  America’s founding in treating fellow human beings as property.  It also explains why many abolitionists thought that owning prop­ erty was a necessary element of emancipation: only by becoming  property-owning citizens could former slaves exercise economic  independence and so fully enjoy their unalienable rights. \nRespect for unalienable rights requires forthright acknowledge­ ment of not only where the United States has fallen short of its  principles but also special recognition of the sin of slavery – an  institution as old as human civilization and our nation’s deepest  violation of unalienable rights. The legally protected and institu­ tionally entrenched slavery that disfigured the United States at  its birth reduced fellow human beings to property to be bought,  sold, and used as a means for their owners’ benefit.

In contemplating slavery  in his Notes on the State of Virginia, he wrote, “I tremble for my  country when I reflect that God is just.” Nevertheless, it would  take a grievous civil war, costing more American lives by far than  any other conflict in the nation’s history, to enable the federal  government to declare slavery unlawful. It would take another  century of struggle to incorporate into the laws of the land  protections to guarantee African Americans their civil and political  rights. Our nation still works to secure, in its laws and culture,  the respect for all persons our founding convictions require. \nIt has been the work of Americans down through the generations  to understand that unalienable rights, realized in part in the privi­ leges and protections of citizenship, apply to all persons without  qualification. Far from a repudiation of, this progress in under­ standing represents fidelity to, the nation’s founding principles. "}

We identified domestic construction projects that were substantially\ncomplete prior to FY 2020 but that continued to be tracked in the CIP account. The\nDepartment does not have clear policies regarding the accounting treatment of domestic\nconstruction projects or processes to monitor the status of domestic construction projects.\nThe untimely transfer of completed domestic construction projects resulted in\nmisstatements in the Department’s asset and expense balances.\n\nIn addition to construction projects for property that the Department owns, under some\ncircumstances the Department pays for the renovation or improvement of facilities that\nare occupied by the Department but that are owned or leased by the General Services\nAdministration (GSA). The Department’s policies require the capitalization of major real\nproperty renovations or leasehold improvements of $1 million or more. We obtained a list\nof ongoing domestic construction projects and found that the costs for each project was\nbeing recorded as operating expenses by the Department, rather than CIP. However, we\ndetermined that several of the projects had estimated costs that met the capitalization\nthreshold. The Department does not have a policy specific to the accounting treatment for\nimprovements to domestic real property under occupancy agreements, such as with GSA.\nWithout a policy, the Department may not appropriately and consistently account for\ndomestic real property transactions, thus understating assets and overstating operating\nexpenses in the Department’s financial statements.\n\ne Leases — The Department manages approximately 17,800 real property leases throughout\nthe world. The majority of the Department’s leases are short-term operating leases. The\nDepartment must disclose the future minimum lease payments (FMLP) related to the\nDepartment’s operating lease obligations in the notes related to the financial statements.\nWe found numerous recorded lease terms that did not agree with supporting\ndocumentation and errors in the Department’s FMLP calculations. The Department’s\nprocesses to record lease information and to ensure the accuracy of FMLP calculations\nwere not always effective. The errors resulted in misstatements in the Department’s notes\nrelated to the financial statements.\n\ne Personal Property — The Department uses several non-integrated systems to track,\nmanage, and record personal property transactions, which are periodically merged or\nreconciled with the financial management system to centrally account for the acquisition,\ndisposal, and transfer of personal property. We identified a significant number of\npersonal property transactions from prior years that were not recorded in the correct fiscal\nyear. In addition, we found that the acquisition value for numerous tested items could not\nbe supported or was incorrect. Furthermore, we found that the gain or loss recorded for\nsome personal property disposals was not recorded properly.

We identified domestic construction projects that were substantially  complete prior to FY 2020 but that continued to be tracked in the CIP account. The  Department does not have clear policies regarding the accounting treatment of domestic  construction projects or processes to monitor the status of domestic construction projects.  The untimely transfer of completed domestic construction projects resulted in  misstatements in the Department’s asset and expense balances. \nIn addition to construction projects for property that the Department owns, under some  circumstances the Department pays for the renovation or improvement of facilities that  are occupied by the Department but that are owned or leased by the General Services  Administration (GSA). The Department’s policies require the capitalization of major real  property renovations or leasehold improvements of   $\\mathbb{S}1$   million or more. We obtained a list  of ongoing domestic construction projects and found that the costs for each project was being recorded as operating expenses by the Department, rather than CIP. However, we determined that several of the projects had estimated costs that met the capitalization  threshold. The Department does not have a policy specific to the accounting treatment for  improvements to domestic real property under occupancy agreements, such as with GSA. Without a policy, the Department may not appropriately and consistently account for  domestic real property transactions, thus understating assets and overstating operating  expenses in the Department’s financial statements.  \n\n \n• Leases – The Department manages approximately 17,800 real property leases throughout the world. The majority of the Department’s leases are short-term operating leases. The Department must disclose the future minimum lease payments (FMLP) related to the Department’s operating lease obligations in the notes related to the financial statements. We found numerous recorded lease terms that did not agree with supporting documentation and errors in the Department’s FMLP calculations. The Department’s processes to record lease information and to ensure the accuracy of FMLP calculations were not always effective. The errors resulted in misstatements in the Department’s notes related to the financial statements.\n\n \n• Personal Property – The Department uses several non-integrated systems to track, manage, and record personal property transactions, which are periodically merged or reconciled with the financial management system to centrally account for the acquisition, disposal, and transfer of personal property. We identified a significant number of personal property transactions from prior years that were not recorded in the correct fiscal year. In addition, we found that the acquisition value for numerous tested items could not be supported or was incorrect. Furthermore, we found that the gain or loss recorded for some personal property disposals was not recorded properly. The Department’s internal control structure did not ensure that personal property acquisitions and disposals were recorded in a complete, timely, and accurate manner. In addition, the Department’s monitoring activities were not effective to ensure proper financial reporting for personal property. The errors resulted in misstatements to the Department’s financial statements. The lack of effective control may result in the loss of accountability for asset custodianship, which could lead to undetected theft or waste. "}

The Department provided approximately  $\\S G2$   million for  the year ended September 30, 2020. \nB. Basis of Presentation and Accounting \nThe statements are prepared as required by the Chief Financial  Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, as amended by the Government  Management Reform Act of 1994. They are presented in  accordance with the form and content requirements of the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136,  Financial Reporting Requirements , revised. \nThe statements have been prepared from the Department’s  books and records, and are in accordance with the  Department’s Accounting Policies (the significant policies  are summarized in this Note). The Department’s Accounting  Policies follow U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) for Federal entities, as prescribed by the Federal  Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB). FASAB’s  SFFAS No. 34,  The Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles, Including the Application of Standards Issued by the  Financial Accounting Standards Board , incorporates the GAAP  hierarchy into FASAB’s authoritative literature. \nThroughout the financial statements and notes, certain  assets, liabilities, earned revenue, and costs have been  classified as intra governmental, which is defined as  transactions made between two reporting entities  within the Federal Government. \nTransactions are recorded on both an accrual and budgetary  basis. Under the accrual method of accounting, revenues  are recognized when earned and expenses are recognized  when incurred without regard to receipt or payment of cash.  Budgetary accounting principles, on the other hand, are  designed to facilitate compliance with legal requirements  and controls over the use of Federal funds. \nAccounting standards require all reporting entities to  disclose that accounting standards allow certain presentations  and disclosures to be modified, if needed, to prevent the  disclosure of classified information. \nThe image shows a conference room setup with two people sitting at a table. One of them is participating in a virtual call, visible on a screen showing multiple participants. The setting includes a U.S. flag and several chairs. The caption indicates that Secretary Pompeo is delivering remarks virtually to the Global Business Alliance in Washington, D.C., on September 10, 2020.\nC. Revenues and Other Financing Sources  \nAs a component of the Government-wide reporting entity,  the Department is subject to the Federal budget process,  which involves appropriations that are provided annually  and appropriations that are provided on a permanent  basis. The financial transactions that are supported by  budgetary resources, which include appropriations, are  generally the same transactions reflected in agency and  the Government-wide financial reports. \nThe reporting entity’s budgetary resources reflect past  congressional action and enable the entity to incur budgetary  obligations, but they do not reflect assets to the Government  as a whole. Budgetary obligations are legal obligations for  goods, services, or amounts to be paid based on statutory  provisions. After budgetary obligations are incurred,  Treasury will make disbursements to liquidate the budgetary  obligations and finance those disbursements in the same  way it finances all disbursements, using some combination  of receipts, other inflows, and borrowing from the public  if there is a budget deficit.

The estimated useful lives for real property are  as follows: \nThe table lists asset categories alongside their estimated useful life:\n\n- **Land Improvements**: 30 years\n- **Buildings and Structures**: 10 to 50 years\n- **Assets Under Capital Lease**: Lease term or 30 years\n- **Leasehold Improvements**: Lesser of lease term or 10 years\nPersonal Property \nPersonal property consists of several asset categories  including aircraft, vehicles, security equipment,  communication equipment, automated data processing  (ADP) equipment, reproduction equipment, and software.  The Department holds title to these assets, some of which  are operated in unusual conditions, as described below. \nThe Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement (INL) uses aircraft to help eradicate and  stop the flow of illegal drugs. To accomplish its mission, INL  maintains an aircraft fleet that is one of the largest Federal,  nonmilitary fleets. Most of the aircraft are under direct INL  air wing management. However, a number of aircraft are  managed by host-countries. The Department holds title  to most of the aircraft under these programs and requires  \ncongressional notification to transfer title for any aircraft to  foreign governments. INL contracts with firms to provide  maintenance support depending on whether the aircraft are  INL air wing managed or host-country managed. INL air  wing managed aircraft are maintained to Federal Aviation  Administration standards that involve routine inspection, \n as well as scheduled maintenance and replacements of certain  parts after given hours of use. Host-country managed aircraft  are maintained to host-country requirements. \nThe Department also maintains a large vehicle fleet that  operates overseas. Many vehicles require armoring for  security reasons. For some locations, large utility vehicles  are used instead of conventional sedans. In addition, the  Department contracts with firms to provide support in  strife-torn areas, such as Iraq and Afghanistan. Contractor  support includes the purchase and operation of armored  vehicles. Under the terms of the contracts, the Department  has title to the contractor-held vehicles. \nPersonal property and equipment with an acquisition  cost of  $\\S25{,}000$   or more, and a useful life of two or more  years, is capitalized at cost. Additionally, all vehicles are  capitalized, as well as internal use software with cost of   $\\S500{,}000$   or more. Except for contractor-held vehicles  in Iraq and Afghanistan, depreciation is calculated on a  straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated life and begins  when the property is placed into service. Contractor-held  vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to the harsh operating  conditions, are depreciated on a double-declining balance  basis. The estimated useful lives for personal property are  as follows:  \nThe table lists asset categories and their estimated useful life. \n\n- **Aircraft:**\n  - INL air wing managed: 10 years\n  - Host-country managed: 5 years\n\n- **Vehicles:**\n  - Department managed: 3 to 6 years\n  - Contractor-held in Iraq and Afghanistan: 2 ½ years\n\n- **Security Equipment:** 3 to 15 years\n\n- **Communication Equipment:** 3 to 20 years\n\n- **ADP Equipment:** 3 to 6 years\n\n- **Reproduction Equipment:** 3 to 15 years\n\n- **Internal Use Software:** Estimated useful life or 5 years"}

Funds from Dedicated Collections \nFunds from Dedicated Collections are financed by specifically  identified revenues, often supplemented by other financing  sources, which remain available over time. These specifically  identified revenues and other financing sources are required  by statute to be used for designated activities or purposes  and must be accounted for separately from the Government’s  general revenues. Additional information is disclosed in  Notes 3 and 13. \nU. Net Position \nThe Department’s net position contains the following  components: \nUnexpended Appropriations:  Unexpended appropriations  is the sum of undelivered orders and unobligated balances.  Undelivered orders represent the amount of obligations  incurred for goods or services ordered, but not yet received.  An unobligated balance is the amount available after  deducting cumulative obligations from total budgetary  resources. As obligations for goods or services are incurred,  the available balance is reduced. \nCumulative Results of Operations:  The cumulative results  of operations include the accumulated difference between  revenues and financing sources less expenses since inception  and donations.\n \nNet position of funds from dedicated collections is separately  disclosed. See Note 13.  \nV. Foreign Currency \nAccounting records for the Department are maintained in  U.S. dollars, while a significant amount of the Department’s  overseas expenditures are in foreign currencies. For account­ ing purposes, overseas obligations and disbursements are  recorded in U.S. dollars based on the rate of exchange as of  the date of the transaction. Foreign currency payments are  made by the U.S. Disbursing Office. \n\nW. Fiduciary Activities \nFiduciary activities are the collection or receipt, and the  management, protection, accounting, investment, and  disposition by the Federal Government of cash or other  assets in which non-Federal individuals or entities have  an ownership interest that the Federal Government must  uphold. The Department’s fiduciary activities are not  recognized on the principal financial statements, but are  reported on schedules as a note to the financial statements.  The Department’s fiduciary activities include receiving  contributions from donors for the purpose of providing  compensation for certain claims within the scope of an  established agreement, investment of contributions into  Treasury securities, and disbursement of contributions  received within the scope of the established agreement.  See Note 18.  \nX. Use of Estimates \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity  with GAAP requires management to make estimates and  assumptions, and exercise judgment that affects the reported  amounts of assets, liabilities, net position, and disclosure of  contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues, financing sources,  expenses, and obligations incurred during the reporting  period. These estimates are based on management’s best  knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions  the Department may take in the future, and various other  assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the  circumstances. Due to the size and complexity of many of \n the Department’s programs, the estimates are subject to a  wide range of variables, including assumptions on future  economic and financial events. Accordingly, actual results  could differ from those estimates. \nY. Comparative Data \nCertain 2019 amounts have been reclassified to conform  to the 2020 presentation. The Consolidated Statement  of Net Cost presentation has been updated to report by  strategic goal for 2020 and 2019. "}

The FSRDS and the FSPS are defined-benefit, single-\nemployer plans. FSRDS was originally established in 1924;\nFSPS in 1986. The FSRDS is a single-benefit retirement plan.\nRetirees receive a monthly annuity from FSRDS for the rest\nof their lives. FSPS provides benefits from three sources: a\nbasic benefit (annuity) from FSPS, Social Security, and the\nThrift Savings Plan.\n\nThe Department’s financial statements present the Pension\nActuarial Liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and\nDisability Program (the “Plan”) as the actuarial present value\nof projected plan benefits, as required by the SFFAS No. 33,\nPensions, Other Retirement Benefits, and other Post Employment\nBenefits: Reporting the Gains and Losses from Changes in\nAssumptions and Selecting Discount Rates and Valuation\n\nDates.

Total projected service is used to determine\neligibility for retirement benefits. The value of voluntary,\ninvoluntary, and deferred retirement benefits is based on\nprojected service and assumed salary increases. The value of\nbenefits for disabled employees or survivors of employees\nis determined by multiplying the benefit the employee or\nsurvivor would receive on the date of disability or death,\nby a ratio of service at the valuation date to projected\n\nservice at the time of disability or death.\n\nThe Pension Actuarial Liability is calculated by applying\nactuarial assumptions to adjust the projected plan benefits\nto reflect the discounted time value of money and the\nprobability of payment (by means of decrements such as\ndeath, disability, withdrawal or retirement) between the\nvaluation date and the expected date of payment. The Plan\nuses the aggregate entry age normal actuarial cost method,\nwhereby the present value of projected benefits for each\nemployee is allocated on a level basis (such as a constant\npercentage of salary) over the employee's service between\nentry age and assumed exit age. The portion of the\npresent value allocated to each year is referred to as\n\nthe normal cost.\n\nThe table below presents the normal costs for 2020 and 2019.\n\nNormal Cost: 2020 2019\nFSRDS 41.07% 37.36%\nFSPS 32.18% 29.78%\n\nActuarial assumptions are based on the presumption that the\nPlan will continue.

FSN employees  participate in a variety of plans established by the Department  in each country based upon prevailing compensation practices  in the host country. The table below summarizes the liability  associated with these plans   (dollars in millions) . \nThe table presents data on after-employment benefit liabilities for Foreign Service Officers and Foreign Service Nationals for the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2019.\n\n1. **Foreign Service Officers:**\n   - \"Foreign Service Retirement and Disability Fund\" liability was $25,014 for 2020 and $23,401 for 2019.\n\n2. **Foreign Service Nationals:**\n   - \"Defined Contribution Fund\" liability was $273 for 2020 and $247 for 2019.\n   - \"Defined Benefit Plans\" liability was $19 for 2020 and $48 for 2019.\n   - \"Lump Sum Retirement and Voluntary Severance\" liability was $593 for 2020 and $463 for 2019.\n   - The total FSN (Foreign Service Nationals) liability was $885 for 2020 and $758 for 2019.\n\n3. **Total After-Employment Benefit Liability:**\n   - The total liability for all categories combined was $25,899 for 2020 and $24,159 for 2019.\nForeign Service Retirement \n and Disability Fund \nThe FSRDF finances the operations of the FSRDS and the  FSPS. The FSRDS and the FSPS are defined-benefit, single- employer plans. FSRDS was originally established in 1924;  FSPS in 1986. The FSRDS is a single-benefit retirement plan.  Retirees receive a monthly annuity from FSRDS for the rest  of their lives. FSPS provides benefits from three sources: a  basic benefit (annuity) from FSPS, Social Security, and the  Thrift Savings Plan. \nThe Department’s financial statements present the Pension  Actuarial Liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and  Disability Program (the “Plan”) as the actuarial present value  of projected plan benefits, as required by the SFFAS No. 33,  Pensions, Other Retirement Benefits, and other Post Employment  Benefits: Reporting the Gains and Losses from Changes in  Assumptions and Selecting Discount Rates and Valuation  Dates . The Pension Actuarial Liability represents the future  periodic payments provided for current employee and retired  Plan participants, less the future employee and employing  Federal agency contributions, stated in current dollars. \n\nFuture periodic payments include benefits expected to  be paid to (1) retired or terminated employees or their  beneficiaries; (2) beneficiaries of employees who have died;  and (3) present employees or their beneficiaries, including  refunds of employee contributions as specified by Plan  provisions. Total projected service is used to determine  eligibility for retirement benefits. The value of voluntary,  involuntary, and deferred retirement benefits is based on  projected service and assumed salary increases. The value of  benefits for disabled employees or survivors of employees  is determined by multiplying the benefit the employee or  survivor would receive on the date of disability or death,  by a ratio of service at the valuation date to projected  service at the time of disability or death. \nThe Pension Actuarial Liability is calculated by applying  actuarial assumptions to adjust the projected plan benefits  to reflect the discounted time value of money and the  probability of payment (by means of decrements such as  death, disability, withdrawal or retirement) between the  valuation date and the expected date of payment. The Plan  uses the aggregate entry age normal actuarial cost method,  whereby the present value of projected benefits for each  employee is allocated on a level basis (such as a constant  percentage of salary) over the employee’s service between  entry age and assumed exit age. The portion of the \n present value allocated to each year is referred to as \n the normal cost. \nThe table below presents the normal costs for 2020 and 2019. \nThe table displays the normal costs for FSRDS and FSPS for the years 2019 and 2020. \n\n- For FSRDS:\n  - 2020: 41.07%\n  - 2019: 37.36%\n\n- For FSPS:\n  - 2020: 32.18%\n  - 2019: 29.78%\nActuarial assumptions are based on the presumption that the  Plan will continue. If the Plan terminates, different actuarial  assumptions and other factors might be applicable for  determining the actuarial present value of accumulated plan  benefits. The assumption changes arise in connection with  the annual valuation and follow the guidelines of SFFAS  No. 33. The following table presents the calculation of the  combined FSRDS and FSPS Pension Actuarial Liability  and  the assumptions used in computing it for the year ended  September 30, 2020 and 2019  (dollars in millions) .

It tracks the following:\n\n- **Benefit obligations beginning of year**: \n  - 2020: $415\n  - 2019: $439\n\n- **Service Cost**: \n  - 2020: $7\n  - 2019: $6\n\n- **Interest Cost**: \n  - 2020: $31\n  - 2019: $29\n\n- **Other**: \n  - 2020: $9\n  - 2019: $(59)\n\n- **Benefit obligations end of year**: \n  - 2020: $462\n  - 2019: $415\nThe table presents information on the changes in plan assets over the years 2019 and 2020. It details the fair value of plan assets at the beginning and end of each year, the return on plan assets, the contributions minus benefits paid, and other factors affecting the plan assets. Additionally, it provides the net defined benefit liability for each year.\n\nHere’s a summary of the table's contents:\n\n1. **Fair value of plan assets beginning of year:**\n   - 2020: $376\n   - 2019: $364\n\n2. **Return on plan assets:**\n   - 2020: $25\n   - 2019: $24\n\n3. **Contributions less Benefits Paid:**\n   - 2020: $23\n   - 2019: $7\n\n4. **Other:**\n   - 2020: $21\n   - 2019: ($19)\n\n5. **Fair value of plan assets end of year:**\n   - 2020: $445\n   - 2019: $376\n\n6. **Net Defined Benefit Liability:**\n   - 2020: $17\n   - 2019: $39\nThe table shows the percentage distribution of different financial assets for the years 2020 and 2019. Here are the details:\n\n- **Insurance Policies**: 32% in 2020, 34% in 2019\n- **Equity Securities**: 41% in 2020, 40% in 2019\n- **Money Market and Cash**: 4% in both 2020 and 2019\n- **Debt Securities**: 23% in 2020, 22% in 2019\n\nThe total for each year sums up to 100%.\nThe principal actuarial assumptions used for 2020 and 2019  for the Germany and UK plans are presented below: \nThe table shows \"Actuarial Assumptions\" for 2020 and 2019, detailing:\n\n- **Discount Rate**: 2.75% – 4.60% for both years\n- **Salary Increase Rate**: 2.25% – 4.10% for both years\n- **Pension Increase Rate**: 1.75% – 3.10% for both years\nRetirement and Voluntary Severance \n Lump Sum Payments  \nIn 74 countries, FSN employees are provided a lump-sum  separation payment when they resign, retire, or otherwise  separate through no fault of their own. The amount of the  payment is generally based on length of service, rate of  pay at the time of separation, and the type of separation.  As of September 30, 2020, approximately 24,000 FSNs  participate in such plans. \nThe cost method used for the valuation of the liabilities  associated with these plans is the Projected Unit Credit   actuarial cost method. The participant’s benefit is first  determined using both their projected service and salary  at the retirement date. The projected benefit is then  multiplied by the ratio of current service to projected service  at retirement in order to determine an allocated benefit.  The Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for the entire plan  is calculated as the sum of the individual PBO amounts for  each active member. Further, this calculation requires certain  actuarial assumptions be made, such as voluntary withdraws,  assumed retirement age, death and disability, as well as  economic assumptions. For economic assumptions, available  market data was scarce for many of the countries where  eligible posts are located. Due to the lack of creditable global  market data, an approach consistent with that used for the  September 30, 2020, FSRDF valuations under SFFAS No. 33  was adopted. Using this approach, the economic assumptions  used for the Retirement and Voluntary Severance Lump Sum  Payment liability as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, are: \nThis table compares the discount rate, rate of inflation, and salary increase for the years 2020 and 2019.

The Department will continue to  dedicate resources to this important initiative in 2021. \nD ebt  M anagement \nOutstanding debt from non-Federal sources (net of allowance)  increased from  $\\S59.7$   million at September 30, 2019 to   $\\S79.3$   million at September 30, 2020. Direct Loans, IBWC,  and Administrative Loans increased by  $\\S22.4$   million while  Civil Monetary Penalties and Passport non-sufficient funds  decreased by   $\\S2.8$   million at September 30, 2020, resulting  in an increase overall to the non-Federal source figures. \nNon-Federal receivables consist of debts owed to the Inter­ national Boundary and Water Commission, Civil Monetary  Fund, and amounts owed for repatriation loans, medical  costs, travel advances, and other miscellaneous receivables. \nThe Department uses installment agreements, salary offset,  and restrictions on passports as tools to collect its receivables.  \nIt also receives collections through its cross-servicing agreement  with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury). In 1998, the  Department entered into a cross-servicing agreement with  Treasury for collections of delinquent receivables. In accordance  with the agreement and the Debt Collection Improvement Act  of 1996 (Public Law No. 104-134), the Department referred   $\\S3.8$   million to Treasury for cross-servicing in 2020. Of the  current and past debts referred to Treasury,  $\\S1.9$   million was  collected in 2020. \nThe table shows information from 2018 to 2020 about accounts, amounts referred, and amounts collected. Here's a breakdown:\n\n**Number of Accounts**\n- 2020: 2,512\n- 2019: 2,823\n- 2018: 1,377\n\n**Amounts Referred (in millions of dollars)**\n- 2020: $3.8 million\n- 2019: $2.7 million\n- 2018: $4.3 million\n\n**Amounts Collected (in millions of dollars)**\n- 2020: $1.9 million\n- 2019: $1.6 million\n- 2018: $1.6 million\nE lectronic  P ayments \nFor 2020, the Department disbursed over 4 million  payments and 99.3 percent of them were processed through  Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). For overseas operations,  the EFT percentage increased from a 2019 percentage of  99.01 percent to a 2020 percentage of 99.36 which is a  major accomplishment given the complexities of banking  operations in some foreign countries. Domestic operations  EFT percentage remained constant at 99.3 percent from  2019 to 2020. \nThe image shows two men standing side by side in a formal setting.

Items in the Register of Culturally Significant  Property category are classified as multi-use heritage assets  due to their use in general government operations. \nD iplomatic  R eception  R ooms  C ollection \nIn 1961, the State Department’s Office of Fine Arts began the  privately-funded Americana Project to remodel and redecorate  the 42 Diplomatic Reception Rooms – including the offices of  the Secretary of State – on the seventh and eighth floors of the  Harry S Truman Building. The Secretary of State, the President,  and Senior Government Officials use the rooms for official  functions promoting American values through diplomacy.  The rooms reflect American art and architecture from the time  of our country’s founding and its formative years,   $1740-1840$  .  The rooms also contain one of the most important collections of  early Americana in the nation, with over 5,000 objects, including  museum-quality furniture, rugs, paintings, and silver. These  items have been acquired through donations or purchases funded  through gifts from private citizens, foundations, and corporations.  No tax dollars have been used to acquire or maintain the  collection. There are three public tours each day. \nThe image shows the Seoul Old American Legation, built in 1883. It is a well-preserved example of traditional Korean residential architecture and is currently used as a guest house. This building symbolizes the long history of Korean-American friendship. The architecture features classic Korean design elements and is surrounded by greenery."}
