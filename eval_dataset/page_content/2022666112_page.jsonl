CD Pharma (2020)  \nOn January 31, 2018, the Danish Competition Council found that Swedish pharmaceutical  distributor CD Pharma AB had misused its dominant position in violation of TFEU article 102  (and   $\\S~11$   of the Danish Competition Act), when it increased the price of Syntocinon (injection  substance   $10\\mathrm{IE/ml})$  ) from Danish Kroner (DKK) 45 to DK 945 (from about   $\\mathrm{US}\\Phi6.28$   to about  US\\$132.06) between April 28, 2014, and October 26, 2014. This was an increase in price of more  than   $2{,}000\\%$  .  In addition, the price was also substantially (between   $100\\%$   to   $8{,}400\\%$  ) higher in  Denmark than in other countries where CD Pharma AB was distributing the Syntocinon drug.  On November 29, 2018, the Competition Appeals Council affirmed the Competition Council’s  decision.  On appeal, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court affirmed the previous decision,  holding that CD Pharma had violated TFEU article 102 and  $\\S\\,11$   of the Danish Competition Act.   Following the court decision, the case has been referred to the Danish State Prosecutor for Serious  Economic and International Crime for further adjudication.   "}

The  Commission imposed a total fine of 427.7 million euros (about US\\$581.8 million at the time),  divided into 331 million euros for Servier, 13.97 million euros for Niche/Unichem, 17.16 million  euros for Matrix, 15.57 million euros for Teva, 10 million euros for Krka, and 40 million euros  for Lupin.   \nOn December 12, 2018, the General Court annulled part of the Commission’s decision, but  confirmed that the agreements between Servier and the generic companies constituted  restrictions of competition by object under article 101 of the TFEU.  However, it reduced the fine  imposed on Servier in respect of the agreement concluded with Matrix by  $30\\%$   and annulled the  fine imposed on Servier on the basis of article 102 TFEU, thereby reducing the total fine for Servier  to 228.32 million euros (about   $\\mathrm{US}\\S259.18$   million at the time).  It completely annulled the fines  imposed on Servier and Krka in respect of that agreement.  In February 2019, Servier further  appealed the decision of the General Court to the CJEU.  The appeal is still pending. The  Advocate General delivered his opinion on July 14, 2022.  He recommended annulling part of  the judgment and dismissing the remainder of the appeal, in particular annulling the fine  imposed on Servier in respect of the Lupin agreement.   "}

This strategy caused generic  versions of Durogesic to arrive on the market several months later than they would otherwise.   \nOn March 6, 2009, Ratiopharm, a pharmaceutical company specializing in generics, sent a letter  to the Competition Authority alleging that Janssen-Cilag was engaging in anticompetitive  behavior.  This letter prompted the Competition Authority to investigate these allegations.  \nThe Competition Authority found that Janssen-Cilag, and its parent company Johnson & Johnson,  had violated article L.420-2 of the French Commercial Code and article 102 of the TFEU, which  both prohibit abuses of market dominance.  In addition to the 25 million euro fine already  mentioned, the Competition Authority ordered the defendants to publish a notice in two leading  medical daily periodicals ( Le Quotidien du Médecin  and  Le Quotidien du Pharmacien ) to inform  readers of the case and its outcome.   \nD.

Such anti-competitive practices were: (i) requiring  pharmaceutical companies in at least some Districts of the State of West Bengal to have  their new stockists obtain a prior Stock Availability Information (SAI)/ No Objection  Certificate (NOC) from BCDA before the supply of drugs could be commenced to them;  (ii) collecting monetary considerations from the prospective stockists against the issuance  of SAI to them, through its District Committees; and (iii) requiring promotion cum  distributor agents of pharma companies to obtain Product Availability Information (PAI)  from BCDA after payment of monetary considerations to it in the form of donations, to  start marketing drugs of their respective pharma companies in the State of West Bengal.  Further, the Commission found that pharmaceutical companies, namely Alkem and  Macleods had an anti-competitive agreement with BCDA whereby these companies, after  issuing the offer letter of stockistship to prospective stockists, demanded from them  SAI/NOC/Approval Letter/Circulation Letter from BCDA, before supplies of drugs  could be commenced to them. For their such conduct, the Commission found Alkem and  Macleods liable for contravention of the provisions of Section 3(1) of the Act and their  various officials have also been found liable by the Commission for such conduct in terms  of Section 48 of the Act.

It  ensures the proper operation of all markets in the interest of Spain’s consumers and corporations  through its authority to issue fines for anticompetitive practices.   \nII.  Cases \nA.  Merck Sharp & Dohme \nIn October 2022, the CNMC imposed a fine of more than 38.9 million euros on the pharmaceutical  company Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) for abuse of a dominant position.  The decision is based  on the fact that the subsidiary of the American pharmaceutical company in Spain filed legal  appeals to hinder the entry of another company into the national market for combined hormonal  contraceptives of the vaginal ring type, a product over which MSD had a monopoly.  The  company may appeal the CNMC’s decision to the National High Court.   \nMSD enjoyed a monopoly from 2002 to 2018 on the first vaginal ring in Spain because it was the  owner of the patent that protected the Nuvaring contraceptive.  A competitor company, Insud  Pharma, developed an alternative ring and began marketing it in June 2017 under the name  Ornibel.  Among other actions, MSD invoked its patent rights. Alleging reasons of urgency, the  company requested that Mercantile Court No. 5 of Barcelona carry out a fact-checking procedure  and then issue an injunction against the manufacture and sale of the Ornibel ring in Spain. As  allowed under Spain’s patent law, the court did so even though Insud Pharma had not been  afforded a hearing.   \nThe CNMC decision concluded that the purpose of these legal actions was not to assert MSD’s  patent rights but rather to suppress competition by a new product entering the market for as long  as possible.  Insud Pharma was unable to resume Ornibel’s production until the mercantile court  lifted the injunction in December 2017.  Because the only factory that produced its rings was  located in Spain, the stoppage affected distribution and sale of the product in all the countries  where it had begun to be marketed, affecting competition in various countries of the European  Union (EU).

It is empowered to  undertake investigations to determine if there has been anticompetitive behavior and to take  enforcement action, such as requiring parties to modify or terminate anticompetitive agreements  or conduct, and imposing fines of up to   $10\\%$   of a company’s worldwide turnover.  When the  CMA calculates a financial penalty, it is required to take a number of factors into account, such  as the seriousness and duration of the infringement and the desirability of deterring  such conduct.    \nThe CMA may also disqualify corporate directors where it determines they knew or should have  known that their company was infringing competition laws and their  conduct makes them unfit  to be in control of the management.  In order to disqualify a director, the CMA must apply to the  court under section 9A of the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.  The CMA is also  able to accept a disqualification undertaking voluntarily offered from directors themselves  instead of undertaking court proceedings.  The CMA typically accepts disqualification  undertakings from directors,  and in addition to avoiding litigation, such undertakings normally  result in the CMA reducing the time period of the disqualification.    \nCompetition law in England and Wales also permits private actions for damages, which the  courts have stated “play an important role in competition law, alongside public enforcement, in  strengthening the working of the competition rules and discouraging anti-competitive  agreements and practices.” 8    "}

The Competition Bureau regularly opens  investigations into the corporate practices of pharmaceutical companies but in general enters into  consent agreements or issues recommendations. This was the case in the Competition Bureau’s  review of the acquisition of Allergan plc by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in 2016.  In 2022,  the Competition Bureau also closed two investigations into “anticompetitive patent litigation  settlement agreements,” as the evidence suggested that the agreements did not breach the  Competition Act.  Other notices of consent agreements or closed investigation are available on  the Competition Bureau’s website.   \nWith respect to current enforcement trends, law firm Blakes explained:  \nThe [Competition] Bureau has initiated a number of inquiries in the pharmaceutical  industry related to alleged attempts to limit entry or expansion by the producers of  generics or biosimilars. In particular, these inquiries have involved allegations that  innovative pharmaceutical companies have engaged in various strategies to restrict entry  and expansion by generic and biosimilar producers. The [Competition] Bureau continues  to express keen interest in bringing such cases to ensure Canadian consumers have access  to generic and biosimilar medicines, and the Commissioner [of Competition] has warned  the pharmaceutical industry that any further alleged refusals to supply samples of brand- name drugs to generic manufacturers will not be tolerated.   \nIn March 2021, the Competition Bureau joined an international working group that will  \nexamine a variety of issues related to mergers in the pharmaceutical industry, including  potential updates and expansion of current theories of harm, the evaluation of the full  "}
