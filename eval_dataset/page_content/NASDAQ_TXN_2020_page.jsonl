Business\n\nWe design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations\nbegan in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or\nsales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report\nthe results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2020, we generated $14.46 billion of revenue.\n\nFor decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through\nsemiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each\ngeneration became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of\ncustomers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications,\nparticularly in industrial and automotive markets.\n\nFor many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will\nown the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a\ncompany that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor.

Business  \nWe design and make semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Our operations  began in 1930, and we are incorporated in Delaware. With headquarters in Dallas, Texas, we have design, manufacturing or  sales operations in more than 30 countries. Our two reportable segments are Analog and Embedded Processing, and we report  the results of our remaining business activities in Other. In 2020, we generated  $\\S14.46$   billion of revenue.  \nFor decades, we have operated with a passion to create a better world by making electronics more affordable through  semiconductors. We were pioneers in the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors and then to integrated circuits. As each  generation became more reliable, more affordable and lower in power, semiconductors were used by a growing number of  customers and markets. This passion is alive today as we help our customers develop electronics and new applications,  particularly in industrial and automotive markets.  \nFor many years, we have run our business with three overarching ambitions in mind. First, we will act like owners who will  own the company for decades. Second, we will adapt and succeed in a world that is ever changing. And third, we will be a  company that we are personally proud to be a part of and that we would want as our neighbor.

As a result, we face\nsignificant global competition from dozens of large and small companies, including both broad-based suppliers and niche\nsuppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies, particularly in Asia.\n\nWe believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factors, including the\nbreadth of a company’s product line, the strength and reach of its channels to market, technological innovation, product\ndevelopment execution, technical support, customer service, quality, reliability, price and manufacturing capacity and\ncapabilities. In addition, manufacturing process and package technologies that provide differentiated levels of performance\nand a structural cost advantage are competitive factors for our analog products, and customers’ prior investments in software\ndevelopment is a competitive factor for our embedded processing products.\n\nMarket cycle\n\nThe “semiconductor cycle” refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventories. The\nsemiconductor market historically has been characterized by periods of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and/or\ninsufficient manufacturing capacity, followed by periods of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and/or excess\nmanufacturing capacity. These are typically referred to as upturns and downturns in the semiconductor cycle. A semiconductor\ncycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing\nfacilities.\n\nWe employ several strategies which have many benefits, including dampening the effect of the semiconductor cycle on TI.\nAs an example, we are focused on building closer direct relationships with customers. When it comes to market cycles, these\nrelationships provide improved insight into customer demand and allow us to more accurately and efficiently manage factory\nloadings and inventory levels, which lead to more stable lead times and higher product availability. Finally, we focus our\nresources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets.

Risk factors\n\nYou should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings. These risk\nfactors are intended to highlight certain factors that may affect our financial condition and results of operations and are not\nmeant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to TI, a company with broad international operations. Like many\ncompanies, we are susceptible to a potential downturn associated with macroeconomic weakness, which may affect our\nperformance and the performance of our customers. Similarly, the price of our securities is subject to volatility due to\nfluctuations in general market conditions, actual financial results that do not meet our and/or the investment community’s\nexpectations, changes in our and/or the investment community’s expectations for our future results, dividends or share\nrepurchases, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\n\nRisks related to our business and industry\n\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition is uncertain.\n\nThe global spread of the novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and the\ncoronavirus disease, COVID-19, has created significant uncertainty and economic disruption, both near-term and potentially\nlong-term. We have modified, and might further modify, our business practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nrelated third-party responses, including from government authorities and our suppliers, customers and distributors, and the\neconomic and social ramifications of the disease and societal responses across the markets in which TI operates. The extent\nto which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect our business, results of operation and financial condition is difficult\nto predict and depends on numerous evolving factors including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; government, social,\nbusiness and other actions that have been and will be taken in response to the pandemic; and the effect of the pandemic on\nshort- and long-term general economic conditions. We might experience short- or long-term constrained supply or volatility\nin customer demand, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results in future periods.\n\nOur global operations subject us to risks associated with domestic or international political, social, economic or\nother conditions.\n\nWe have facilities in more than 30 countries. About 90% of our revenue comes from shipments to locations outside the\n\nUnited States; shipments of products to China-based customers represent about 20% of our revenue. Certain countries where\nwe operate have experienced, and other countries may experience, trade tension that affects global trade and macroeconomic\nconditions through the enactment of tariffs, import or export restrictions, trade embargoes and sanctions, restrictions on cross-\nborder investment and other trade barriers. Trade tensions impact our ability to deliver products and product support into China,\ncause Chinese customers to seek alternate suppliers and could otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n\nWe are exposed to political, social and economic conditions, security risks, terrorism or other hostile acts, health conditions\nand epidemics, labor conditions, and possible disruptions in transportation, communications and information technology\nnetworks of the various countries in which we operate. In addition, our global operations expose us to periods when the U.S.\ndollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non-U.S. currencies in which we transact business. The remeasurement of\nnon-U.S. dollar transactions can have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe face substantial competition that requires us to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressures.\n\nWe face intense technological and pricing competition in the markets in which we operate. We expect this competition will\ncontinue to increase from large competitors and from small competitors serving niche markets, and also from emerging\ncompanies, particularly in Asia, that sell products into the same markets in which we operate. For example, we may face\nincreased competition as a result of China actively promoting and reshaping its domestic semiconductor industry through\npolicy changes and investment. These actions, in conjunction with trade tensions, may restrict us from participating in the\nChina market or may prevent us from competing effectively. Certain competitors possess sufficient financial, technical and\nmanagement resources to develop and market products that may compete favorably against our products, and consolidation\namong our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively. The price and product development pressures that result\nfrom competition may lead to reduced profit margins and lost business opportunities in the event that we are unable to match\nthe price declines or cost efficiencies, or meet the technological, product, support, software or manufacturing advancements\nof our competitors.\n\n2020 FORM 10-K * PAGE 8\n", "vlm_text": "You should read the following risk factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and other of our filings  with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and in materials incorporated by reference into these filings.

Any      of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and reputation.  \nOur results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if a customer or a distributor suffers a  loss with respect to our inventory.  \nWe have consignment inventory programs in place for some of our largest customers and distributors. If a customer or  distributor were to experience a loss with respect to TI-consigned inventory, our results of operations and financial condition  would be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer, distributor or insurer, or  if our recovery is delayed.  \nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by distributors’ promotion of competing product lines or our  distributors’ financial performance.  \nIn 2020, about half of our revenue was generated from sales of our products through distributors. Our distributors carry  competing product lines, and our sales could be affected if semiconductor distributors promote competing products over our  products. Moreover, our results of operations could be affected if our distributors suffer financial difficulties that result in their  inability to pay amounts owed to us. Disputes with current or former distributors could be disruptive or harmful to our business.  "}

Negative values are represented with parentheses. The absence of contextual information makes it difficult to determine the exact nature of the data in this table.\nThe table contains a set of numbers arranged in a 3x3 grid above a horizontal line, and a single row of numbers below the line. The numbers are a mix of positive and negative values, with negative numbers indicated by parentheses. The numbers above the line are:\n\n- Top row: (649), (847), (1,131)\n- Middle row: 4, 30, 9\n- Bottom row: (5,786), (3,444), (5,641)\n- Below the line: (36), 32, (23)\n\nThe final row, below a horizontal line, contains: (922), (1,920), (78)\n\nThis layout suggests a possible financial or accounting context with positive values typically representing gains or revenues, and the negative values (in parentheses) representing losses, expenses, or liabilities.\nThe table appears to have numerical data organized in rows and columns. Each cell contains a number, and some numbers are enclosed in parentheses, which typically indicates negative values in financial statements or other tabular data contexts. The table consists of three columns and eight rows, with no header or labels to explain the contents further. Without additional context or captions, it is unclear what these numbers specifically represent.\nThe table contains numerical data organized in three columns and three rows. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n1. **First Row**: Contains the numbers 670, (1), and 782.\n2. **Second Row**: Contains the numbers 2,437, 2,438, and 1,656.\n3. **Third Row**: Contains monetary values: $3,107, $2,437, and $2,438.\n\nThe numbers and monetary values are aligned under each column but without any captions or labels to define what they represent.\nSee accompanying notes.

We\nhave a variety of types of contracts with our customers and distributors. In determining whether a contract exists, we evaluate\nthe terms of the arrangement, the relationship with the customer or distributor and their ability to pay.\n\nWe recognize revenue from sales of our products, including sales to our distributors, when control is transferred. Control is\nconsidered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required,\nwhen the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to\nthe customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is\ngenerally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the\nproducts.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time,\nwhen the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and\ntransfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to\npay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we\nretain control over the products’ disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount\nmethodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally\ninclude adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentives. The length of time between invoicing and\npayment is not significant under any of our payment terms. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from\nthe timing of invoicing, we have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component.\n\nIn addition, we record an allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable that we estimate may not be collected. We monitor\ncollectability of accounts receivable primarily through review of accounts receivable aging. When collection is at risk, we\nassess the impact on amounts recorded for credit losses and, if necessary, record a charge in the period such determination is\nmade.\n\nWe recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in\ncost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\nAdvertising costs\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $28 million, $30 million and $34 million\nin 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\nIncome taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the\ncurrent year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized\nin the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of\nthe deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n2020 FORM 10-K * PAGE 31\n", "vlm_text": "Basis of presentation  \nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States (GAAP).

Stock compensation  \nWe have stock options outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. The option price per share may not be less  than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. The options have a 10-year term, generally vest ratably  over four years and continue to vest after the option recipient retires.  \nWe also have RSUs outstanding to participants under long-term incentive plans. Each RSU represents the right to receive one  share of TI common stock, issued on the vesting date, which is generally four years after the date of grant. RSUs continue to  vest after the recipient retires. Holders of RSUs receive an annual cash payment equivalent to the dividends paid on our  common stock.  \nWe have options and RSUs outstanding to non-employee directors under director compensation plans. The plans generally  provide for annual grants of stock options and RSUs, a one-time grant of RSUs to each new non-employee director and the  issuance of TI common stock upon the distribution of stock units credited to director deferred compensation accounts.  \nWe also have an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) under which options are offered to all eligible employees in amounts  based on a percentage of the employee’s compensation, subject to a cap. Under the plan, the option price per share is   $85\\%$   of  the fair market value on the exercise date.  \nThe table provides financial data for the years ending December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Effective April 1, 2016, the TI common  stock fund was frozen to new contributions or transfers into the fund.  \nOur aggregate expense for the U.S. defined contribution plans was \\$61 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018.  \nThe defined benefit pension plans include employees still accruing benefits, as well as employees and participants who no  longer accrue service-related benefits, but instead, may participate in the enhanced defined contribution plan. Benefits under   the qualified defined benefit pension plan are determined using a formula based on years of service and the highest five  consecutive years of compensation. We intend to contribute amounts to this plan to meet the minimum funding requirements    of applicable local laws and regulations, plus such additional amounts as we deem appropriate. The non-qualified defined  benefit plans are unfunded and closed to new participants.  \nU.S. retiree health care benefit plan  \nU.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements are offered medical coverage during retirement. We make a contribution  toward the cost of those retiree medical benefits for certain retirees and their dependents. The contribution rates are based upon  various factors, the most important of which are an employee’s date of hire, date of retirement, years of service and eligibility  for Medicare benefits. The balance of the cost is borne by the plan’s participants. Employees hired after January 1, 2001, are  responsible for the full cost of their medical benefits during retirement.  \nNon-U.S. retirement plans  \nWe provide retirement coverage for non-U.S. employees, as required by local laws or to the extent we deem appropriate,  through a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Retirement benefits are generally based on an employee’s  years of service and compensation. Funding requirements are determined on an individual country and plan basis and are  subject to local country practices and market circumstances.  \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as a result of employees’ elections, TI’s non-U.S. defined contribution plans held TI  common stock valued at  $\\S36$   million and  $\\S28$   million, respectively.

In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds\nis selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide\ncash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of\nreturn of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality\nbonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield\ncurve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a\npresent value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For\ncountries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate.\n\nAssumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset\nclass and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses\nof the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of\nthe plans’ investments.

There are three categories detailed in the table: U.S. Defined Benefit, U.S. Retiree Health Care, and Non-U.S. Defined Benefit. \n\n1. **Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations:**\n   - **Discount Rate:**\n     - U.S. Defined Benefit: 2.81% (2020), 3.62% (2019)\n     - U.S. Retiree Health Care: 2.74% (2020), 3.63% (2019)\n     - Non-U.S. Defined Benefit: 1.31% (2020), 1.46% (2019)\n   - **Long-term Pay Progression:**\n     - U.S. Defined Benefit: 3.70% (2020), 3.30% (2019)\n     - U.S. Retiree Health Care: Not applicable (both years)\n     - Non-U.S. Defined Benefit: 3.15% (2020), 3.06% (2019)\n\n2. **Weighted Average Assumptions Used to Determine Net Periodic Benefit Cost:**\n   - **Discount Rate:**\n     - U.S. Defined Benefit: 3.42% (2020), 4.35% (2019)\n     - U.S. Retiree Health Care: 3.63% (2020), 4.30% (2019)\n     - Non-U.S. Defined Benefit: 1.46% (2020), 1.85% (2019)\n   - **Long-term Rate of Return on Plan Assets:**\n     - U.S. Defined Benefit: 4.00% (2020), 4.90% (2019)\n     - U.S. Retiree Health Care: 3.50% (2020), 4.40% (2019)\n     - Non-U.S. Defined Benefit: 2.93% (2020), 3.62% (2019)\n   - **Long-term Pay Progression:**\n     - U.S. Defined Benefit: 3.30% (both years)\n     - U.S. Retiree Health Care: Not applicable (both years)\n     - Non-U.S. Defined Benefit: 3.06% (2020), 3.03% (2019) \n\nThe data indicates that discount rates, long-term pay progression, and long-term rates of return on plan assets have shown variation across different years and benefit categories.\nWe utilize a variety of methods to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in  the country in which the benefit plan operates. In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds  is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds. The selected portfolio is designed to provide  cash flows sufficient to pay the plan’s expected benefit payments when due. The resulting discount rate reflects the rate of  return of the selected portfolio of bonds. For our non-U.S. locations with a sufficient number of actively traded high-quality  bonds, an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flows from the defined benefit plans are discounted against a yield  curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high-quality corporate bonds available in each country. In this manner, a  present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value. For  countries that lack a sufficient corporate bond market, a government bond index is used to establish the discount rate.  \nAssumptions for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are based on future expectations for returns for each asset  class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing. We adjust the results for the payment of reasonable expenses  of the plan from plan assets. We believe our assumptions are appropriate based on the investment mix and long-term nature of  the plans’ investments. Assumptions used for the non-U.S. defined benefit plans reflect the different economic environments  within the various countries.  "}

We believe this  approach ensures that ESG issues are overseen by the Committee with the appropriate focus. For example, climate-related  issues are reviewed with the Audit Committee by the worldwide environmental, safety and health director. The GSR  Committee also oversees ESG matters in connection with its responsibility to review public issues of interest to company  stakeholders. Management also provides updates to the GSR Committee at least annually on shareholder policies and proposals  regarding ESG matters that are relevant to the company.  \nDirector compensation  \nThe GSR Committee has responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations to the board on compensation for non- employee directors, with the board making the final determination. The committee has no authority to delegate its responsibility  regarding director compensation. In carrying out this responsibility, it is supported by TI’s Human Resources organization. The  CEO, the senior vice president responsible for Human Resources and the Secretary review the recommendations made to the  committee. The CEO also votes, as a member of the board, on the compensation of non-employee directors.  \nThe compensation arrangements in 2020 for the non-employee directors were:  \nx   Annual retainer of  $\\mathbb{S}110{,}000$   for board and committee service.  x   Additional annual retainer of   $\\S35{,}000$   for service as the lead director.  x   Additional annual retainer of   $\\mathbb{S}30{,}000$   for service as chair of the Audit Committee;  $\\mathbb{S20,000}$   for service as chair of the  Compensation Committee; and  $\\mathbb{S}20{,}000$   for service as chair of the GSR Committee.  x   Annual grant of a 10-year option to purchase TI common stock pursuant to the terms of the Texas Instruments 2018  Director Compensation Plan (Director Plan), which was approved by stockholders in April 2018. The grant date value  is approximately   $\\mathbb{S}100{,}000$  , determined using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model (subject to the board’s ability to  adjust the grant downward). These non-qualified options become exercisable in four equal annual installments  beginning on the first anniversary of the grant and also will become fully exercisable in the event of termination of  service following a change in control (as defined in the Director Plan) of TI. If a director’s service terminates due to  death, disability or ineligibility to stand for re-election under the company’s by-laws, or after the director has  completed eight years of service, then all outstanding options held by the director shall continue to become exercisable  in accordance with their terms. If a director’s service terminates for any other reason, all outstanding options held by  the director shall be exercisable for 30 days after the date of termination, but only to the extent such options were  exercisable on the date of termination.  x   Annual grant of restricted stock units pursuant to the Director Plan with a grant date value of   $\\mathbb{S}100{,}000$   (subject to the  board’s ability to adjust the grant downward).

The director may  defer settlement of the restricted stock units at his or her election. Upon settlement, the director will receive one share  of TI common stock for each restricted stock unit.

Please see Notes 1 and 2 to the summary compensation table for  information about how grant date fair value was calculated.  \nThe “Total” for Mr. Lizardi for 2020 was higher than 2019 primarily due to higher equity awards in 2020, reflecting an effort to  align with the projected market range for similarly situated executives in our comparator group. The “Total” for Mr. Ilan was  higher primarily due to higher equity awards and bonus in 2020. Mr. Ilan assumed chief operating officer responsibilities in  August 2020.  "}

Templeton and Flessner chose to have their benefits frozen. The other named executive officers joined the company\nafter 1997 and are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code (IRC) imposes certain limits on the retirement benefits that may be provided under a qualified plan.\nTo maintain the desired level of benefits, we have non-qualified defined benefit pension plans for participants in the qualified\npension plan. Under the non-qualified plans, participants receive benefits that would ordinarily be paid under the qualified\npension plan but for the limitations under the IRC. For additional information about the defined benefit plans, please see “2020\npension benefits.”\n\nIn general, if an employee who participates in the pension plan (including an employee whose benefits are frozen as described\nabove) dies after having met the requirements for normal or early retirement, his or her beneficiary will receive a benefit equal\nto the lump-sum amount that the participant would have received if he or she had retired before death. Having already reached\nthe age of 55 and at least 20 years of employment, Mr. Templeton is eligible for early retirement under the pension plans.\n\nAll employees who are not accruing benefits in the qualified pension plan are eligible to participate in a defined contribution\nplan that provides employer matching contributions. All named executive officers participate or participated until their\nretirement. This plan provides for (i) a fixed employer contribution plus an employer matching contribution for employees\nhired on or before December 31, 2003 or (ii) an employer matching contribution for employees hired after December 31, 2003.\n\nThe committee considers the potential effect on the executives’ retirement benefits when it sets salary and performance bonus\nlevels.\n\nDeferred compensation\n\nAny U.S. employee whose base salary and management responsibility exceed a certain level may defer the receipt of a portion\nof his or her salary, bonus and profit sharing. Rules of the U.S. Department of Labor require that this plan be limited to a select\ngroup of management or highly compensated employees. The plan allows employees to defer the receipt of their compensation\nin a tax-efficient manner. Eligible employees include, but are not limited to, the executive officers. We have the plan to be\ncompetitive with the benefits packages offered by other companies.\n\nThe executive officers’ deferred compensation account balances are unsecured and all amounts remain part of the company’s\noperating assets. The value of the deferred amounts tracks the performance of investment alternatives selected by the\nparticipant. These alternatives are identical to those offered to participants in the defined contribution plans described above.\nThe company does not guarantee any minimum return on the amounts deferred. In accordance with SEC rules, no earnings on\ndeferred compensation are shown in the summary compensation table for 2020 because no “above market” rates were earned\non deferred amounts in that year.\n\nEmployee stock purchase plan\n\nWe have an employee stock purchase plan. Under the plan, which our shareholders approved, all employees in the U.S. and\ncertain other countries may purchase a limited number of shares of the company’s common stock at a 15 percent discount.

This “change in the actuarial value” is the  difference between the 2019 and 2020 present value of the pension benefit accumulated as of year-end by the named  executive officer, assuming that benefit is not paid until age 65. Mr. Templeton’s and Mr. Flessner’s benefits under the  company’s pension plans were frozen as of December 31, 1997. Messrs.

These provisions are intended to strengthen retention and provide a reasonable remedy to TI in case of  competition, solicitation of our employees or disclosure of our confidential information.  \nOptions become fully vested if the grantee is involuntarily terminated from employment with TI (other than for cause) within  24 months after a change in control of TI. “Change in control” is defined as provided in the Texas Instruments 2009 Long- Term Incentive Plan and occurs upon (i) acquisition of more than  $50\\%$   of the voting stock or at least  $80\\%$   of the assets of TI or  (ii) change of a majority of the board of directors in a 12-month period unless a majority of the directors then in office endorsed  the appointment or election of the new directors (“Plan definition”). These terms are intended to reduce employee uncertainty  and distraction in the period leading up to a change in control, if such an event were to occur.   \nStock awards  \nThe “Stock Awards” column in the table of outstanding equity awards at fiscal year-end 2020 are RSU awards. Each RSU  represents the right to receive one share of TI common stock on a stated date (the “vesting date”) unless the award is terminated  earlier under terms summarized below. In general, the vesting date is approximately four years after the grant date. Each RSU  includes the right to receive dividend equivalents, which are paid annually in cash at a rate equal to the amount paid to  stockholders in dividends.  \nThe table outlines three scenarios regarding the vesting and issuance of shares upon employment termination.\n\n1. **Employment Termination Due to Death or Permanent Disability or at Least Six Months after Grant When Retirement Eligible**:\n   - In this scenario, vesting continues, and shares are paid at the scheduled vesting date.\n\n2. **Employment Termination For Cause**:\n   - In this case, the grant is canceled, and no shares are issued.\n\n3. **Other Circumstances of Employment Termination**:\n   - For these circumstances, the grant is canceled as well, and no shares are issued."}

Participants are eligible for early retirement at 55 years of age with 20 years of employment or 60 years of age with\nfive years of employment. As of December 31, 2020, Mr. Templeton was eligible for early retirement.\n\nParticipants may request payment of accrued benefits at termination or any time thereafter. Participants may choose a lump-\nsum payment or one of six forms of annuity. In order of largest to smallest periodic payment, the forms of annuity are (i) single\nlife annuity, (ii) 5-year certain and life annuity, (iii) 10-year certain and life annuity, (iv) joint and 50% survivor annuity,\n\n(v) joint and 75% survivor annuity and (vi) joint and 100% survivor annuity. Participants who do not request payment will\nbegin to receive benefits in April of the year after reaching the age of 72 in the form of annuity required under the IRC.\n\nThe pension formula for the qualified plan is intended to provide a participant with an annual retirement benefit equal to\n\n1.5 percent multiplied by the product of (i) years of credited service and (ii) the average of the five highest consecutive years of\nthe participant’s base salary plus bonus up to a limit imposed by the IRS, less a percentage (based on the participant’s year of\nbirth, when the participant elects to retire and the participant’s years of service with TI) of the amount of compensation on\nwhich the participant’s Social Security benefit is based.\n\nIf an individual takes early retirement and chooses to begin receiving an annual retirement benefit at that time, such benefit is\nreduced by an early retirement factor. As a result, the annual benefit is lower than the one the participant would have received\nat age 65.\n\nParticipants whose employment terminates due to disability may choose to receive their accrued benefits at any time prior to\nage 65. Alternatively, the participant may choose to defer receipt of the accrued benefit until reaching age 65 and then take a\ndisability benefit. The disability benefit paid at age 65 is based on salary and bonus, years of credited service the participant\n\nwould have accrued to age 65 had the participant not become disabled, and disabled status.\n\nThe benefit payable in the event of death is based on salary and bonus, years of credited service and age at the time of death,\nand may be in the form of a lump sum or annuity at the election of the beneficiary.

For such amounts, “change in control” is defined as (i) acquisition of   $20\\%$   percent of TI common stock other  than through a transaction approved by the board of directors, or (ii) change of a majority of the board of directors in a 24- month period unless a majority of the directors then in office have elected or nominated the new directors. For all amounts  accrued under this plan, if a sale of substantially all of the assets of the company occurred, the present value of the individual’s  benefit would be distributed in a lump sum as soon as reasonably practicable following the sale of assets. For amounts under  Plan II, no distribution of benefits is triggered by a change in control.  \nTI Employees Survivor Benefit Plan  \nTI’s qualified and non-qualified pension plans provide that upon the death of a retirement-eligible employee, the employee’s  beneficiary receives a payment equal to half of the benefit to which the employee would have been entitled under the pension  plans had the employee retired instead of died. We have a survivor benefit plan that pays the beneficiary a lump sum that, when  added to the reduced amounts the beneficiary receives under the pension plans, equals the benefit the employee would have  been entitled to receive had the employee retired instead of died. Because Mr. Templeton was eligible for early retirement as of  December 31, 2020, his beneficiaries would be eligible for benefits under the survivor benefit plan if he were to die.  \n2020 non-qualified deferred compensation \nThe following table shows contributions to each named executive officer’s deferred compensation account in 2020 and the  aggregate amount of his deferred compensation as of December 31, 2020. \n\n \nThe table presents financial data related to contributions, earnings, withdrawals/distributions, and balances for various individuals during the last fiscal year (FY). Here's a breakdown of the columns in the table:\n\n1. **Name**: Lists the names of the individuals.\n2. **Executive Contributions in Last FY ($)**: Shows the amount each executive contributed during the last fiscal year.\n3. **Registrant Contributions in Last FY ($)**: Indicates the contributions made by the registrant for each individual in the last fiscal year.\n4. **Aggregate Earnings in Last FY ($)**: Displays the total earnings for each person in the last fiscal year.\n5. **Aggregate Withdrawals/Distributions ($)**: Provides the total withdrawals or distributions for each person.\n6. **Aggregate Balance at Last FYE ($)**: Represents the total balance at the end of the last fiscal year for each individual.\n\nEach row corresponds to a different person, detailing their financial contributions, earnings, withdrawals, and balance for the specified period.\n(1)  Amounts shown for Messrs. Templeton and Ilan include a portion of their salary and bonus paid in 2020; for Messrs.  Lizardi, Flessner and Kozanian include a portion of their bonus paid in 2020; and for Mr. Anderskouv include a portion  of his salary paid in 2020.  \n\n \n(2)  Company matching contributions pursuant to the defined contribution plan. These amounts are included in the “All  Other Compensation” column of the 2020 summary compensation table.  "}

Too many Board of\nDirectors have found ways to keep marginal directors on the Board who fail to obtain even a minimal 51%-vote when they are\nthe only candidate.\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted written consent in 2019 after 45%- support (less than a\nmajority vote) for a written consent shareholder proposal.\n\nA shareholder right to act by written consent might be a way to motive some of our poorer performing directors. For instance\nCarrie Cox and Todd Bluedorn each received more than 297 million against votes at our 2019 annual meeting. This compares\nunfavorably to the only 2 million against votes that Martin Craighead received.\n\nIt is also important to adopt written consent to make up for loss of the right of shareholders to an in- person annual shareholder\nmeeting.\n\nWith the near universal use of internet annual shareholder meetings starting in 2020 shareholders no longer have the right to\ndiscuss concerns with other shareholders and with their directors at a shareholder meeting which can now be an internet\nmeeting which is an inferior format to a Zoom meeting.\n\nShareholders are also severely restricted in making their views known at internet shareholder meetings because all critical\nquestions and comments can be screened out at an internet meeting. For instance Goodyear management hit the mute button\nright in the middle of a formal shareholder proposal presentation at its 2020 shareholder meeting due to a well-deserved critical\nstatement that Goodyear management did not want to hear.\n\nPlease vote yes:\nShareholder Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4\n\nThe board of directors recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal for the following reasons:\n\ne Written consent shortcuts debate on key company decisions and can disenfranchise stockholders. Delaware law\nand SEC rules provide a meeting framework that promotes informed and deliberate engagement among a company’s\nstockholders. Action by written consent ignores that framework. When stockholders are asked to take action at a\nmeeting, those soliciting votes are obligated to provide materials that inform the stockholder of the actions to be\nconsidered and the consequences of any outcomes. That obligation is not required of written consent solicitations, with\nthe result that stockholders could be requested to take action without all necessary information and without appropriate\ntime to deliberate. Written consent further disenfranchises stockholders by eliminating the requirement that all\nstockholders participate in key corporate decisions. Because only some stockholders need be solicited for their\nconsent, others lose the opportunity to engage on the requested action.\n\ne Stockholders already have several methods through which they can influence company practices without acting\nby written consent. Primarily, our annual stockholder meeting provides an opportunity for stockholders to provide\ndirect feedback by voting on director nominees, executive compensation, auditor selection and other matters that come\nbefore the meeting, or to ask questions of management. If stockholders make the board or management aware of\nevents warranting stockholder action between annual meetings, the by-laws permit the Chairman, CEO, or Secretary to\ncall a special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may also bring specific items of business before the company and\nother stockholders by submitting proposals for inclusion in the company’s proxy materials to be voted on at the\nmeeting, or to be voted on at the meeting without being included in company proxy materials. Company by-laws also\nallow stockholders to nominate directors at the meeting or using proxy access.\n\n2021 PROXY STATEMENT * PAGE 46\n", "vlm_text": "Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent.

Too many Board of  Directors have found ways to keep marginal directors on the Board who fail to obtain even a minimal  $51\\%$  -vote when they are  the only candidate.  \nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) said it adopted written consent in 2019 after   $45\\%$  - support (less than a  majority vote) for a written consent shareholder proposal.  \nA shareholder right to act by written consent might be a way to motive some of our poorer performing directors. For instance  Carrie Cox and Todd Bluedorn each received more than 297 million against votes at our 2019 annual meeting. This compares  unfavorably to the only 2 million against votes that Martin Craighead received.  \nIt is also important to adopt written consent to make up for loss of the right of shareholders to an in- person annual shareholder  meeting.  \nWith the near universal use of internet annual shareholder meetings starting in 2020 shareholders no longer have the right to  discuss concerns with other shareholders and with their directors at a shareholder meeting which can now be an internet  meeting which is an inferior format to a Zoom meeting.  \nShareholders are also severely restricted in making their views known at internet shareholder meetings because all critical  questions and comments can be screened out at an internet meeting. For instance Goodyear management hit the mute button  right in the middle of a formal shareholder proposal presentation at its 2020 shareholder meeting due to a well-deserved critical  statement that Goodyear management did not want to hear.  \nPlease vote yes:  Shareholder Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4  \nThe board of directors recommends a vote “AGAINST” this proposal for the following reasons:  \nx   Written consent shortcuts debate on key company decisions and can disenfranchise stockholders.  Delaware law  and SEC rules provide a meeting framework that promotes informed and deliberate engagement among a company’s  stockholders. Action by written consent ignores that framework. When stockholders are asked to take action at a  meeting, those soliciting votes are obligated to provide materials that inform the stockholder of the actions to be  considered and the consequences of any outcomes. That obligation is not required of written consent solicitations, with  the result that stockholders could be requested to take action without all necessary information and without appropriate  time to deliberate. Written consent further disenfranchises stockholders by eliminating the requirement that all  stockholders participate in key corporate decisions. Because only some stockholders need be solicited for their  consent, others lose the opportunity to engage on the requested action.     x   Stockholders already have several methods through which they can influence company practices without acting  by written consent.  Primarily, our annual stockholder meeting provides an opportunity for stockholders to provide  direct feedback by voting on director nominees, executive compensation, auditor selection and other matters that come  before the meeting, or to ask questions of management. If stockholders make the board or management aware of  events warranting stockholder action between annual meetings, the by-laws permit the Chairman, CEO, or Secretary to  call a special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may also bring specific items of business before the company and  other stockholders by submitting proposals for inclusion in the company’s proxy materials to be voted on at the  meeting, or to be voted on at the meeting without being included in company proxy materials. Company by-laws also  allow stockholders to nominate directors at the meeting or using proxy access.      "}
