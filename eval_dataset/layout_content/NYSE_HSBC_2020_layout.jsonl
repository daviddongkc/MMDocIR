Net insurance premium income  of  $\\S10.1$  bn was  $\\S0.5$  bn lower  than in 2019, reflecting lower new business volumes, particularly  in France and Hong Kong, partly offset by lower reinsurance  arrangements in Hong Kong. Other operating income  of  $\\S0.5$  bn decreased by  $\\S2.4$  bn  compared with 2019, primarily due to lower favourable changes in  PVIF compared with 2019 (down  $\\mathbb{S}1.4\\mathsf{b n})$   and also the non- recurrence of a  $\\S0.8\\mathsf{b r}$   dilution gain in 2019 following the merger  of The Saudi British Bank (‘SABB’) with Alawwal bank in Saudi  Arabia. The change in PVIF included a reduction of   $\\S0.8$  bn due to  assumption changes and experience variances, mainly in Hong  Kong and France due to the effect of interest rate changes on the  valuation of liabilities under insurance contracts. In addition, the  value of new business written fell by   $\\S0.4\\mathsf{b n}$  , primarily in Hong  Kong, as sales volumes decreased. The reduction also reflected the non-recurrence of 2019 gains  recognised in Argentina and Mexico.  Net insurance claims and benefits paid and movement in  liabilities to policyholders  was  $\\S2.3\\mathsf{b r}$   lower, primarily due to  lower returns on financial assets supporting contracts where the  policyholder is subject to part or all of the investment risk.

The ECL charge in 2020 reflected a significant increase in stage 1  and stage 2 allowances, notably in the first half of the year, to  reflect the deterioration in the forward economic outlook globally  as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak. The economic outlook  stabilised in the second half of 2020 and as a result stage 1 and  stage 2 allowances were broadly unchanged at 31 December  2020, compared with 30 June 2020.

These\nconsiderations include stressed scenarios that\nreflect the increasing uncertainty that the global\nCovid-19 outbreak has had on HSBC's operations,\nas well as considering potential impacts from other\ntop and emerging risks, and the related impact on\nprofitability, capital and liquidity.\n\nGoodwill and other non-financial assets\nimpairment\n\nDuring the year, management tested for impairment\ngoodwill and other non-financial assets. Key\njudgements in this area relate to long-term growth\nrates, discount factors and what cash flows to\ninclude for each cash-generating unit tested, both in\nterms of compliance with the accounting standards\nand reasonableness of the forecast. During the\nyear, the Group recognised $1.3bn impairment in\nrelation to non-financial assets, following which a\ndetailed analysis of various balance sheet amounts\nwas initiated.\n\nAssociates (Bank of Communications Co.,\nLimited and The Saudi British Bank)\n\nDuring the year, management performed the\nimpairment review of HSBC's investment in Bank of\nCommunications Co., Ltd (‘BoCom’) and The Saudi\nBritish Bank (‘SABB’). The impairment reviews are\ncomplex and require significant judgements, such\nas projected future cash flows, discount rate, and\nregulatory capital assumptions.\n\nLegal proceedings and regulatory matters\n\nManagement has used judgement in relation to the\nrecognition and measurement of provisions, as well\nas the existence of contingent liabilities for legal\nand regulatory matters, including, for example, an\nFCA investigation into HSBC Bank's and HSBC UK\nBank's compliance with the UK money laundering\nregulations and financial crime systems and\ncontrols requirements.\n\nValuation of defined benefit pension\nobligations\n\nThe valuation of defined benefit pension obligations\ninvolves highly judgemental inputs and\nassumptions, of which the most sensitive are the\ndiscount rate, pension payments and deferred\npensions, inflation rate and changes in mortality.\n\nValuation of financial instruments\n\nDue to the volatile market conditions in 2020,\nmanagement refined its approach to valuing\nGroup's investment portfolio. In addition, as losses\nwere incurred on the novation of certain derivative\nportfolios, management considered whether fair\nvalue adjustments were required under the fair\nvalue framework. Management's analysis provided\ninsufficient evidence to support the introduction of\nthese adjustments in line with IFRS.\n\nTax-related judgements\n\nHSBC has recognised deferred tax assets to the\nextent that they are recoverable through expected\nfuture taxable profits. Significant judgement\ncontinues to be exercised in assessing the\nprobability and sufficiency of future taxable profits,\nfuture reversals of existing taxable temporary\ndifferences and ongoing tax planning strategies.\n\nUK customer remediation\n\nManagement's judgement is used in determining\nthe assumptions used to calculate the Group’s\nremediation provisions, of which the most material\n\nare PPI and a programme in relation to the\ncollections and recoveries operations of the bank.\n\nIn accordance with the UK and Hong Kong Corporate Governance Codes, the\nDirectors carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks of the Group and\nparent company. The GAC considered the statement to be made by the Directors\nand concluded that the Group and parent company will be able to continue in\noperation and meet liabilities as they fall due, and that it is appropriate that the\nlong-term viability statement covers a period of three years.\n\nThe GAC received reports on management's approach to goodwill and other non-\nfinancial assets impairment testing and challenged the approach and models\nused. The GAC also challenged management's key judgements and considered\nthe reasonableness of the outcomes as a sense check against the business\nforecasts and strategic objectives of HSBC. The GAC reviewed the results of\nmanagement's detailed analysis of the balance sheet and agreed with the\nconclusions.\n\nThe GAC reviewed the judgements in relation to the impairment reviews of\nHSBC's investment in BoCom and SABB, including the sensitivity of the results to\nestimates and key assumptions such as projected future cash flows and\nregulatory capital assumptions. Additionally, the GAC reviewed the models’\nsensitivity to long-term assumptions including the continued appropriateness of\nthe discount rates.\n\nThe GAC received reports from management on the legal proceedings and\nregulatory matters that highlight the accounting judgements for matters where\nthese are required. The matters requiring significant judgements were highlighted.\nThe GAC has reviewed these reports and agree with the conclusions reached by\nmanagement.\n\nThe GAC has considered the effect of changes in key assumptions on the HSBC.\nUK Bank plc section of the HSBC Bank (UK) Pensions Scheme, which is the\nprincipal plan of HSBC Group.\n\nThe GAC considered the key valuation metrics and judgements involved in the\ndetermination of the fair value of financial instruments. The GAC considered the\nvaluation control framework, valuation metrics, significant year-end judgements\nand emerging valuation topics and agrees with the judgements applied by\nmanagement.\n\nThe GAC considered the recoverability of deferred tax assets, in particular in the\n\nUS and the UK. The GAC also considered management's judgements relating to\n\ntax positions in respect of which the appropriate tax treatment is uncertain, open\nto interpretation or has been challenged by the tax authority.\n\nThe GAC considered and challenged management's assumptions and the\napproach for estimating potential outflows relating to the calculations of the\ncustomer remediation provisions.\n", "vlm_text": "The table is structured with three columns: \"Areas of focus,\" \"Key issues,\" and \"Conclusions and actions.\"\n\n1. **Areas of focus**: \n   - Significant accounting judgements\n\n2. **Key issues**:\n   - Long-term viability and going concern statement\n   - Goodwill and other non-financial assets impairment\n   - Associates (Bank of Communications Co., Limited and The Saudi British Bank)\n   - Legal proceedings and regulatory matters\n   - Valuation of defined benefit pension obligations\n   - Valuation of financial instruments\n   - Tax-related judgements\n   - UK customer remediation\n\n3. **Conclusions and actions**:\n   - The GAC (Group Audit Committee) reviewed various management approaches, judgements, and assumptions across these areas. \n   - They assessed reports, challenged assumptions, and agreed with conclusions reached by management.\n   - The focus was on compliance with standards, assumptions validity, sensitivity to assumptions, and regulatory capital assumptions.\n   - Valuation metrics were considered, alongside fair value adjustments and tax position judgments."}

This included carrying out a\nnumber of targeted audit reviews, in addition to audits of significant programmes.\nThese reviews focused on key elements of change management.\n\nThe Committee has oversight for the adequacy of resources and expertise, as well\nas succession planning for the Global Finance function. During 2020, the\nCommittee dedicated significant time to the review and progress of the multi-year\nGlobal Finance transformation programme, with the overall objectives being to\nimprove the control environment and customer outcomes and to leverage\ntechnology to increase overall efficiency. In particular, the Committee discussed\nthe challenges to Global Finance operations, including financial reporting, from\nthe Covid-19 pandemic and sought assurance that controls were in place to\nmaintain standards and quality.\n\nThe Committee reviewed and challenged the key change programmes and\ndelivery milestones and tracked the progress of the deliverables. In particular, the\nCommittee considered the impact from the Global Finance transformation on the\nGroup transformation programme, regulatory change programmes and where\nthere were interdependencies and concentrations risks through key programmes\nsuch as Finance on the Cloud. There were frequent discussions with management\nwith input from Global Internal Audit on the impact on key risks and controls,\nincluding steps taken to mitigate these risks. Management regularly updated the\nCommittee on the approach and plans for regulatory engagement, including\nfollow-up on the outcomes and actions to be taken post-meetings with regulators.\nThe Group Chief Financial Officer had private sessions with the Committee to\nshare his perspectives on the progress of the Global Finance transformation, areas\nof strategic priorities and where additional focus was required. The private\nsessions included discussion on succession planning and resourcing and areas\nwhere GAC members could support and guide management by leveraging\nmembers’ experience.\n\nIFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’\n\nThe Committee will oversee the transition to IFRS\n17 and consider the wider strategic implications of\nthe change on the insurance business.\n\nManagement provided an update on the final standard amendments that were\nissued in June 2020 and discussed the impact on the transition programme\nnecessitated by the one-year delay to the effective date, both from a policy\nimplementation and model build perspective. The discussions highlighted the\nsignificant uncertainty that remained in the interpretation of key areas and the\nworking assumptions adopted by management to enable design solutions,\ninvestment in technology and data infrastructure to proceed.\n\nThe Committee discussed the impact from IFRS 17 on HSBC's reported numbers\nin the financial statements and management will continue to consider how to\nappropriately apply the standard to HSBC’s insurance business, as well as\nmonitoring insurance industry developments on disclosures.

{"layout": 3534, "type": "text", "text": "1 Noel Quinn succeeded John Flint as interim Group Chief Executive with effect from 5 August 2019 and was appointed permanently into the role  on 17 March 2020. The remuneration included in the single figure table above for 2019 is in respect of his services provided as an executive  Director for that year. 2 As outlined on page 230, the executive Directors each donated a quarter of their base salary for six months in 2020. The base salary shown in the  single figure of remuneration is the gross salary before charitable donations. 3 Taxable benefits include the provision of medical insurance, accommodation, car and tax return assistance (including any associated tax due,  where applicable). Non-taxable benefits include the provision of life assurance and other insurance cover.  4 Under the policy approved by shareholders, executive Directors can receive  $50\\%$   of their annual incentive award in cash and the remaining 50% in  immediately vested shares subject to a one-year retention period. As the executive Directors each decided not to take an annual cash bonus, the  2020 annual incentive is the amount after this waiver and will be delivered in immediately vested shares subject to a one-year retention period.  The total annual incentives waived by the Group Chief Executive and Group Chief Financial Officer were £799,000 and £450,000, respectively. 5 'Notional returns' refers to the notional return on deferred cash for awards made in prior years. The deferred cash portion of the annual incentive  granted in prior years includes a right to receive notional returns for the period between the grant date and vesting date, which is determined by  reference to a rate of return specified at the time of grant. A payment of notional return is made annually and the amount is disclosed on a paid  basis in the year in which the payment is made.  6 As set out in the 2018 Directors' remuneration report, in 2019 Ewen Stevenson was granted replacement awards to replace unvested awards,  which were forfeited as a result of him joining HSBC. The awards, in general, match the performance, vesting and retention periods attached to  the awards forfeited, and will be subject to any performance adjustments that would otherwise have been applied. The values included in the table  for 2019 relate to Ewen Stevenson's 2015 and 2016 LTI awards granted by The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc ('RBS') for performance years  2014 and 2015, respectively, and replaced with HSBC shares when Ewen Stevenson joined HSBC. These awards are not subject to further  performance conditions and commenced vesting in March 2019. The total value is an aggregate of £1,121,308 for the 2015 LTI and £852,652 for  the 2016 LTI. The 2016 LTI award value has been determined by applying the performance assessment outcome of  $27.5\\%$   as disclosed in RBS's  Annual Report and Accounts 2018 (page 70) to the maximum number of shares subject to performance conditions. Values in the table for 2020  relate to his 2017 LTI award granted by RBS for performance year 2016, which was determined by applying the performance assessment  outcome of  $56.25\\%$   as disclosed in RBS's Annual Report and Accounts 2019 (page 91) to the maximum number of shares subject to performance  conditions. This resulted in a payout equivalent to  $78.09\\%$   of the RBS award shares that were forfeited and replaced with HSBC shares. A total of  313,608 shares were granted in respect of his 2017 LTI replacement award at a share price of £6.643. The HSBC share price was £5.845 when  the awards ceased to be subject to performance conditions, with no value attributable to share price appreciation.

A culture of ‘looking out for each other’ was\nencouraged and employee networks held regular support calls for employees, specifically those experiencing mental\nhealth challenges and those with caring responsibilities.\n\nWe ran a mid-year employee survey to determine how the Covid-19 outbreak was impacting our colleagues and how we\ncould support them through this period. More than 50% of our total employee population responded, of which more than\n89% said they were getting the information they needed from the organisation, 86% reported that they were getting the\nsupport they needed from their line manager, and 86% of the respondents reported they felt confident in leadership.

Good progress was made, with key achievements including\nthe design and launch of the global ethnicity inclusion programme, progression of the global disability confidence\nprogramme and the appointment of new executive sponsors for the ‘Embrace’ and ‘Balance’ employee resource groups.\nWe delivered phase one of the global diversity data project, which collected and reported employee ethnicity data in 21\ncountries and territories through a self-identification campaign.\n\nGroup Executive Committee succession planning\n\nSuccession plans have been updated for all Group Executive Committee roles and approved by the Group Nomination &\nCorporate Governance Committee.\n\nThe Group also identified a number of enterprise critical roles across the organisation and succession plans have also been\nupdated for these roles with approval from the Group Executive Committee.\n\nThe majority of ‘ready now’ and ‘develop in role’ successors on these plans have undergone leadership assessments with\nour third-party specialist provider, with all development plans documented. A global executive coaching panel is utilised\nand executive development solutions have been designed to be implemented in 2021.\n\nEnvironment\n\nSustainable operations and\nsustainable finance\n\nWe reduced our carbon emission tonnes to 1.76 per full-time equivalent employee (‘FTE’), beating the target of 2.0 tonnes\nper FTE we had set for 2020. It was recognised that reduced travel and increased working from home due to the Covid-19\noutbreak impacted this outcome, and as a result, the performance assessment for this metric was revised down.\n\nWe exceeded our sustainable finance and investment target of $24bn by facilitating, financing and investing in the\ndevelopment of clean energy, lower-carbon technologies and projects that contribute to the delivery of the Paris\nAgreement and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nWe were recognised as 'The World's Best Bank for Sustainable Finance’ by Euromoney in its Awards for Excellence 2020.\n\nAwareness of climate change impacts across the organisation continued to increase, with 93% of relationship managers\ncompleting their required sustainability training modules.\n\nRisk and compliance\n\nAchieve effective\nmanagement of non-\nfinancial risk Group-wide\nand fulfilment of regulatory\nobligations.\n\nAchieve sustained delivery\nagainst the Global Conduct\nframework and effective\nfinancial crime risk\nmanagement.\n\nIn spite of the additional stress due to the operational challenges of the Covid-19 outbreak, enabled by the non-financial\nrisk optimisation programme outcomes, the organisation maintained fair customer outcomes and a stable non-financial\nrisk profile while implementing new products and adapting to significantly different ways of working.\n\nIn 2020, we completed our financial crime risk operational effectiveness exercise programme, with all countries having\npassed the Global Standards exit criteria and assurance. While there was year-on-year improvement in performance\nagainst a number of specific financial crime risk metrics, it was recognised that some further work is still required. The\nexecutive Directors demonstrated strong commitment to the conduct framework, maintaining focus on fair outcomes for\nour customers and market integrity.

We also use a countercyclical funding methodology,\npool and with both a floor and a ceiling, with the payout ratio generally reducing as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality. The floor\nindividual recognises that even in challenging times, remaining competitive is important. The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance\n\nperformance it is not always necessary to continue to increase the variable pay pool, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive\nscorecard financial performance.\nThe main quantitative and qualitative performance and risk metrics used for assessment of performance include:\n* Group and business unit financial performance, including capital requirements;\n* current and future risks, taking into consideration performance against the risk appetite statement (‘RAS’), annual operating plan and\nglobal conduct outcomes;\n* fines, penalties and provisions for customer redress, which are automatically included in the Committee's definition of profit; and\n* assessment of individual performance with reference to a balanced scorecard of clear and relevant objectives. Objectives included in\nthe performance scorecards of senior management take into account appropriate measures linked to sustainability risks, such as:\nreduction in carbon footprint; facilitating financing to help clients with their transition to net zero; employee diversity targets; and risk\nand compliance measures. A mandatory global risk objective is included in the scorecard of all other employees. All employees receive\n\na behaviour rating as well as a performance rating, which ensures performance is assessed not only on what is achieved but also on\nhow it is achieved.\n\nRemuneration ¢ The performance and reward of individuals in control functions, including risk and compliance employees, are assessed according to a\nfor control balanced scorecard of objectives specific to the functional role they undertake.

The following key principles underpin HSBC's identification process:\n\n— MBTs are identified at Group, HSBC Bank (consolidated) and HSBC UK Bank level.\n— MBTs are also identified at other solo regulated entity level as required by the regulations.\n\n— When identifying an MRT, HSBC considers an employee's role within its matrix management structure. The global business and\nfunction that an individual works within takes precedence, followed by the geographical location in which they work.\n\ne In addition to applying the qualitative and quantitative criteria specified in the RTS, we also identify additional MRTs based on our own\ninternal criteria, which include compensation thresholds and individuals in certain roles and grades who otherwise would not be\nidentified as MRTs under the criteria prescribed in the RTS.\n\n¢ The list of MRTs, and any exclusions from it, is reviewed by chief risk officers and chief operating officers of the relevant global\nbusinesses and functions.

In addition, treasury  shares are also held within HSBC’s Insurance business retirement funds for the benefit of policyholders or beneficiaries within employee trusts for  the settlement of shares expected to be delivered under employee share schemes or bonus plans, and the market-making activities in Global  Markets. 4 Cumulative goodwill amounting to  $\\S5,$  ,138m has been charged against reserves in respect of acquisitions of subsidiaries prior to 1 January 1998,  including \\$3,469m charged against the merger reserve arising on the acquisition of HSBC Bank plc.

{"layout": 4685, "type": "text", "text": "The impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying  amount. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management’s best estimates of future earnings available  to ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the best  estimate. There are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management’s best estimate of BoCom’s  earnings, which is based on explicit forecasts over the short to medium term. This results in forecast earnings growth that is lower than  recent historical actual growth and also reflects the uncertainty arising from the current economic outlook. Earnings beyond the short to  medium term are then extrapolated into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to derive a terminal value, which comprises the  majority of the VIU. The second component is the capital maintenance charge (‘CMC’), which is management’s forecast of the earnings  that need to be withheld in order for BoCom to meet regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period, meaning that CMC is  deducted when arriving at management’s estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders. The principal inputs to the CMC  calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets and the expected minimum regulatory  capital requirements. An increase in the CMC as a result of a change to these principal inputs would reduce VIU. Additionally,  management considers other factors, including qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate.
