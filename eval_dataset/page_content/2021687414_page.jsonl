Pakistan ’s ratio of Chinese debt is lower   $(27.4\\%)$  , but CPEC energy power  projects may increase  Pakistan ’s debt burden because of sovereign guarantees,   and these projects  are currently facing a circular debt problem.

Some observers also note China’s willingness to renegotiate,\nwaive, or restructure loans in some cases. For example, some or all of the above factors may have\ncontributed to China’s willingness to renegotiate with Djibouti regarding its debt in respect to\nthe Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. Pakistan also is negotiating with China in order to\nrestructure the terms of energy projects, seeking to cut interest rates on current power sector-\nrelated loans and a 10-12 year extension on the debt repayment period.\n\nOther commentators note that, with the focus on debt, not enough attention is drawn toward\nsome of the mutual economic benefits that BRI projects brings to China and the host country.

Local Companies/Local Job Creation\n\nIn some host countries, all major BRI projects appear to be dominated by Chinese companies and\nstate-owned enterprises, sometimes in joint ventures or partnerships with local businesses and\nother third parties. In Central Asia, for example, BRI projects are predominantly built by Chinese\ninvestors and companies, and such projects are disproportionately backed by Chinese state\nfinanciers. There has been considerable criticism over corruption and the lack of transparency,\ndue diligence, and competitive bidding/fair procurement practices involved in BRI projects\nacross host countries. For example, in Kenya, the China Road and Bridge Corporation was\nawarded the contract to build the SGR without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010\nConstitution and 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. Similarly, in Pakistan, there were\nreported irregularities violating procurement rules in the award for highways and motorways\nprojects. In Malaysia, some of the projects and deals have generated controversy and have\nformed part of the corruption allegations against Najib Razak, the former prime minister who\ninitiated them. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant\nprojects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country,\nand the former prime minister was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020.\nConcerns about potential violations of procurement processes, concessions in respect to local\ncontent, and fair labor practices have also been raised in a number of Caribbean countries.\n\nAs part of the BRI 2.0, China is putting greater emphasis on transparency and abiding by\ninternational rules on bidding and procurement.

During the second Belt and Road Forum (Second BRF), leaders  issued a joint communiqué that stated the BRI would strive to “build high-quality, reliable,  resilient and sustainable infrastructure” and recognized a need for more “diversified and  sustainable financial supports for projects” from national and international financial institutions. President Xi Jinping’s remarks during the forum also emphasized that  China  would make BRI  more financially sustainable. As a result,  China ’s Ministry of Finance formulated the Debt  Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.  The aim of  the framework is to promote sustainable economic and social development of BRI countries while  ensuring debt sustainability. It is a nonmandatory policy tool to conduct debt sustainability  analysis and manage debt risks to support lending decisions.  \nIV. Local Companies/Local Job Creation    \nIn some host countries, all major BRI projects appear to be dominated by Chinese companies and  state-owned enterprises, sometimes in joint ventures or partnerships with local businesses and  other third parties. In  Central Asia , for example, BRI projects are predominantly built by Chinese  investors and companies, and such projects are disproportionately backed by Chinese state  financiers. There has been considerable criticism over corruption and the lack of transparency,  due diligence, and competitive bidding/fair procurement practices involved in BRI projects  across host countries. For example, in  Kenya , the China Road and Bridge Corporation was  awarded the contract to build the SGR without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010  Constitution and 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. Similarly, in  Pakistan , there were  reported irregularities violating procurement rules in the award for highways and motorways  projects. In  Malaysia , some of the projects and deals have generated controversy and have  formed part of the corruption allegations against Najib Razak, the former prime minister who  initiated them. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant  projects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country,  and the former prime minister was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020.  Concerns about potential violations of procurement processes, concessions in respect to local  content, and fair labor practices have also been raised in a number of  Caribbean  countries.    \nAs part of the BRI 2.0,  China  is putting greater emphasis on transparency and abiding by  international rules on bidding and procurement. The joint communiqué of the Second BRF  highlighted “the importance of open, transparent and non-discriminatory public procurement  procedures” and “zero tolerance in anti-corruption.” The 2019 BRI Progress report, which was  released just before the forum, stated that  China  is willing to join all other countries in improving  legal systems and mechanisms to fight corruption, improve business environments, and punish  commercial bribery.

In Pakistan, CPEC is expected to add over 700,000 jobs to the Pakistani labor market\nfrom 2015 to 2030. Some commentators reported estimates exceeding 2.3 million jobs by 2030.\nHowever, it appears that a large portion of the jobs generated by these projects employ unskilled\nlaborers while most skilled opportunities go to Chinese workers. Similarly, in Egypt, although\nChinese companies are hiring local Egyptian workers, there is a concern that local employees are\nunderrepresented in the companies’ managerial positions. This may deny the workers the\nopportunity to gain important knowledge and skills.\n\nV. Military or Strategic Purposes of Projects\n\nCommentators have written about the potential and actual use of certain BRI-linked ports and\nother maritime assets for strategic and military purposes, but this is usually downplayed or\nrejected by the host country and China. A report by the BRI Leadership Group, China's\ngovernment coordination body, stresses that the BRI is not a geopolitical or military alliance, but\n“an initiative for peaceful development and economic cooperation.”\n\nCambodia and China are suspected of having signed a secret agreement granting China\nexclusive rights over a certain part of the Ream Naval Base, although both governments deny\nthis. Similarly, the Gwador seaport in Pakistan is often highlighted as an example of a potential\nor likely site for a Chinese overseas naval base. However, according to available reports, it is not\ncurrently being used as a People’s Liberation Army military base, and both governments have\ndownplayed any military use for the port. Some experts note, however, that the port may still\nserve China’s broader strategic and other policy objectives. In Greece, COSCO Shipping, a state-\nowned enterprise, has a majority stake in and operates the Piraeus Port Authority, making the\nPort of Piraeus the first major seaport in the European Union that is wholly managed by a Chinese\ncompany, raising strategic concerns among US and European allies. In Portugal, its maritime\nassets, the Port of Sines and the archipelago of the Azores, have attracted investment and strategic\ninterest from China. In March 2019, President el-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support of the BRI, and he\ncalled for enhanced defense cooperation in August 2020. A Chinese company, Hutchison Ports,\nhas signed a long-term agreement with the Egyptian navy for the development and operation of\na new container terminal inside the Abu Qir Naval Base on the Mediterranean Sea. In addition,\nDjibouti hosts China’s only foreign military base, a naval facility adjacent to the Doraleh\nMultipurpose Port from which it can participate in anti-piracy operations and generally\nsafeguard its access to the strategic maritime route along the coast of the Horn of Africa.\n", "vlm_text": "\nLocal job creation has been another area of controversy in BRI projects in a number of host  countries.

Furthermore, while it has a largely authoritarian  regime whose president has been in power since 1999,  Djibouti is nonetheless one of the region’s  few politically stable countries, making it an ideal access point for Chinese commercial interests  into inland African countries such as Ethiopia.  Djibouti’s importance to China is highlighted by  the fact that the small nation now hosts China’s only foreign military base, a naval facility adjacent  to the Doraleh Multipurpose Port from which it can participate in anti-piracy operations and  generally safeguard its access to the strategic maritime route.

Djibouti earns  an estimated US\\$125 million a year in rents from the United States, China, France, Japan, and  Italy combined.  In addition to this income, Djibouti sees these bases as a guarantee of its  sovereignty.  Thus, “Djibouti’s power and influence is disproportionately greater than the state’s  small size and ostensibly ‘dependent’ roles would suggest.” 62   \nSome or all of these factors may have contributed to China’s willingness to renegotiate loans with  Djibouti. Indeed, both Djibouti and Ethiopia appear to have obtained a significant restructuring  of the debt by which the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway was financed, with an extension of  repayment periods from 10 to 30 years.   \nB.  Doraleh Container Terminal  \nThe idea that Djibouti may have gotten into a “debt trap” with Beijing has been fueled by the  nationalization of the Doraleh Container Terminal, a move by which China Merchants Group  ended up obtaining a minority stake in this important asset.  \nLocated just east of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, the Doraleh Container Terminal has been  described as the “crown jewel” of the country’s port complex and is its greatest source of  revenue.  Contrary to the other projects mentioned here, China was not directly involved in its  construction. It was designed, built, and operated by the United Arab Emirates conglomerate DP  World under a 30-year concession agreement.  It opened in 2009 and appears to have operated  without any major problem until 2012, when Djiboutian officials began to complain that DP  World was “deliberately under-developing the [Doraleh Container Terminal] so as to prevent  Djibouti from ever achieving parity with, or surpassing, Jebel Ali Port, the company’s flagship  operation in Dubai.” 66  Additionally, Djiboutian officials accused DP World of undercutting  Djibouti by simultaneously developing competing ports elsewhere in the Red Sea.  Furthermore,  the initial contract, which was allegedly obtained through bribes, “gave DP World extraordinary  authority over Djibouti’s infrastructure development, reportedly including a provision that any  further development of Djibouti’s ports required signoff from Dubai.” 68  For several years, the  Djiboutian government attempted to renegotiate the concession, but was unsuccessful.  In 2018,  citing “flagrant contraventions of state sovereignty” and the unwillingness of DP World to settle  the issues amicably, it unilaterally terminated the concession contract and nationalized the  Doraleh Container Terminal.  DP World has sought judicial remedies and obtained favorable  rulings from the London Court for International Arbitration and the High Court of England and  Wales, but these rulings have been ignored by Djibouti.  The terminal is now controlled by the  DPFZA, in which China Merchants Group owns a   $23.5\\%$   stake. This fact has led to reports that  China was taking over the Doraleh Container Terminal, and DP World has sued China Merchants  Group for allegedly inducing the breach of contract.  In remarks delivered at the Heritage  Foundation in December 2018, US National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed “soon, Djibouti  may hand over control of the Doraleh Container Terminal, a strategically-located shipping port  on the Red Sea, to Chinese state-owned enterprises.” 73    "}

Anti-Dumping Policies Against Chinese Products   \nDespite the ongoing cooperation between Egypt and China and the growing Chinese investments  in Egypt over the past five years, the Egyptian government has imposed an anti-dumping duty  on a number of imported Chinese products. For instance, the minister of trade issued Ministerial  Resolution No. 40 of 2018 to impose an anti-dumping duty of   $11\\%$   on imports of tires for buses  and trucks from Chinese company Prinx Chengshan (Shandong) Tire Company Ltd.  Also,  according to a news report issued in July 2020, the Egyptian Trade and Industry Ministry  announced that will maintain the   $55\\%$   to   $74\\%$   anti-dumping duties on synthetic fiber blankets  imported from China until August 2025.  In addition, according to a news article published on  the official website of the Arab Iron and Steel Union, the Ministry of Trade and Industry decided  to impose an anti-dumping duty of   $20.14\\%$   at a rate of not less than   $\\S141$   per ton on imports of  iron alloys (ferrosilicon) from China for a period of five years, beginning April 1, 2021.

It appears that all African countries, with  the exception of Benin, Eritrea, Eswatini, Mali, and Sao Tome and Principe, have either signed a  memorandum of understanding or expressed their support.  By April 2019, China had signed  BRI cooperation documents with 39 of the 53 African countries and the African Union.  Kenya’s  location is considered by China to be a key “maritime pivot point” for the initiative.  According  to one source, “Chinese policymakers viewed Kenya as a prime opportunity because of its  strategic location as a ’maritime pivot point’ offering access to the East and Central Africa and its  ability to serve as a conduit for raw materials, including Sudanese and Ugandan oil.” 6   "}

This, together with the fact that the  National Construction Authority did not become operational until 2017, meant that the  regulations did not apply to the SGR project.    \nC.   The Court of Appeal Decision   \nIn 2014, the Law Society of Kenya and human rights activists petitioned the High Court of Kenya  at Nairobi challenging the constitutionality and legality of the construction of the SGR project. The High Court summarized the petitioners’ case as follows:  "}

First is Kenya’s strategic location, which serves as a gateway to  Eastern and Central parts of Africa; the SGR “will open up a fast-growing and progressively- integrating region to Chinese and international trade and investment.” 139  Second is the fact that  the SGR “railway construction and operation contracts are major international business  opportunities for (state-owned) Chinese companies affected by oversupply in the Chinese  domestic market.” 140   \nWhile China foresees significant benefits from the BRI, African countries involved in the program,  including Kenya, are also likely to gain from it as well. For instance, although other countries  have negotiated their own agreements with China, Kenya’s SGR project is said to be the initial  phase of what would be a regional railway network connecting Uganda, Rwanda and South  Sudan.

In 2019, a Cambodian think tank director asserted  “that Cambodia is still in the safe zone with regards to external debt management and that BRI  provides more opportunities than risks to Cambodian economy and society.” 25  Another BRI  observer has stated “Cambodia’s decision to develop BRI projects through private companies  rather than government-to-government loans may . . . reduce the debt-trap risk.   At the same time,  adopting large Chinese infrastructure investments may eventually constrain Cambodia’s  strategic autonomy and lead to its economic dependence on China.” 26   "}

This came amid a corruption scandal involving former prime minister Najib,\nwhich included allegations that the cost of certain BRI projects had been inflated in order to bail\nout the state-owned investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhard (IMDB), from which\nNajib was accused of misappropriating funds. According to one author,\n\n[t]here are numerous indications that Najib concluded very unfavourable deals with\nBeijing amounting to at least USD 34 billion in order to close 1MDB’s financial gap that\nwas created by his embezzlement.

CPEC has been described as BRI’s flagship project. CPEC\nofficially launched in April 2015 during an official visit by China’s President Xi Jinping\nto Pakistan. CPEC projects include four major areas: the energy sector, transportation\ninfrastructure, the deep-sea port of Gwadar, and industrial cooperation through the\ndevelopment and construction of Special Economic Zones. Projects are divided into\nthree timeframes, Phase I (2017-2020), Phase II (2020-2025), and Phase III (2025-2030).\nInitial investments were valued at $46 billion, while estimates as of 2020 were\n$62 billion.\n\nProjects under CPEC take the form of numerous bilateral agreements and other\narrangements. At the time of its official launch in 2015, both countries signed 51\nagreements, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and financing contracts. The\ndetails of these and later agreements are generally kept secret. Every CPEC project has\ndifferent terms and conditions and are built and financed independently from each\nother. They are also financed using a variety of different structures that may involve\nPakistani state entities, Chinese state-owned enterprises, Pakistani private firms, and\nother third parties. Project financing often include a mix of Chinese grants, government\nconcessional low-interest loans, zero-interest loans and investments through public-\nprivate partnerships (which may involve equity financing).\n\nCPEC infrastructure projects being developed through low-interest government\nconcessional loans, no-interest loans, or grants are often highlighted to dispute the\nnarrative that Pakistan is taking massive loans and that CPEC and is creating a debt\nburden. On the other hand, CPEC power projects have engendered particular\ncontroversy over debt sustainability; the government faces a “circular debt” problem\nand is negotiating with China to restructure the terms of these projects. Though some\nexperts believe that these projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign debt burden, there\nis disagreement on whether this is a deliberate strategy on the part of China to create a\n“debt trap” or if it is due to the need for electricity infrastructure upgrades and other\npoor governance/ planning issues.\n\nThe Gwador port is often highlighted as a potential or likely site for a People’s\nLiberation Army (PLA) overseas naval base.

CPEC has been described as BRI’s flagship project. CPEC  officially launched in April 2015 during an official visit by China’s President Xi Jinping  to Pakistan. CPEC projects include four major areas: the energy sector, transportation  infrastructure, the deep-sea port of Gwadar, and industrial cooperation through the  development and construction of Special Economic Zones. Projects are divided into  three timeframes, Phase I (2017-2020), Phase II (2020-2025), and Phase III (2025-2030).  Initial investments were valued at   $\\S46$   billion, while estimates as of 2020 were   $\\S62$   billion.  \nProjects under CPEC take the form of numerous bilateral agreements and other  arrangements. At the time of its official launch in 2015, both countries signed 51  agreements, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and financing contracts. The  details of these and later agreements are generally kept secret. Every CPEC project has  different terms and conditions and are built and financed independently from each  other. They are also financed using a variety of different structures that may involve  Pakistani state entities, Chinese state-owned enterprises, Pakistani private firms, and  other third parties. Project financing often include a mix of Chinese grants, government  concessional low-interest loans, zero-interest loans and investments through public- private partnerships (which may involve equity financing).    \nCPEC infrastructure projects being developed through low-interest government  concessional loans, no-interest loans, or grants are often highlighted to dispute the  narrative that Pakistan is taking massive loans and that CPEC and is creating a debt  burden. On the other hand, CPEC power projects have engendered particular  controversy over debt sustainability; the government faces a “circular debt” problem  and is negotiating with China to restructure the terms of these projects. Though some  experts believe that these projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign debt burden, there  is disagreement on whether this is a deliberate strategy on the part of China to create a  “debt trap” or if it is due to the need for electricity infrastructure upgrades and other  poor governance/planning issues.   \nThe Gwador port is often highlighted as a potential or likely site for a People’s  Liberation Army (PLA) overseas naval base. However, it is reportedly not currently  being used for a PLA base, and both governments have downplayed any military use  for the port. Some experts note, however, that the port may still serve China’s broader  strategic and other policy objectives.   "}

NEPRA has allowed a Sinosure fee of up to 7 percent of the total debt servicing to  be included in the project cost used to calculate the tariffs for all CPEC power  generation projects.    \nAnother paper notes a number of issues involving insurance arrangements for these projects:  \nFirst of all, Sinosure insurance coverage is mandatory for all Chinese loans and  investments; it is required for anyone outside China who wants access to this type of  capital. This is not uncommon since insurance for international development measures can  be seen as standard procedure. But Sinosure is the only insurance provider accepted by  Chinese lenders, and consequently is holds the monopoly over China’s development  project insurances in both the BRI and CPEC. Sinosure’s monopoly not only undermines  the free market choice in this sector; the company also charges higher fees than its  international competitors which does not conform with international norms  and practices.

Although the debt  financing arrangements for CPEC power sector projects primarily involve loans from  Chinese banks to project companies wholly or partly owned by Chinese firms, these  projects may increase Pakistan’s debt because of sovereign guarantees issued by Islamabad  to support CPEC power projects and the liquidity crisis in Pakistan’s power sector known  as circular debt. That said, several aspects of the China-Pakistan relationship and the large  stake that China’s government and companies have in the success of CPEC indicate that  Chinese  interests  are  better  served  by  sustainable  CPEC  projects  than  unsustainable ones.   \nOther observers, including the current Pakistani government, describe the “debt trap” narrative  as a false, misleading, or simplistic assessment. Advocates of CPEC, including the Pakistani  government, have described it as an economic “game changer” and a “win-win project of China- Pakistan economic cooperation.  ${\\prime\\prime}_{123}$   Both governments describe characterizations of CPEC as a  “debt trap” as “devoid of facts” and hold that not enough attention is drawn to the mutual  economic benefits to both countries and the region.  One paper highlights some of these  economic and trade benefits to Pakistan:  \nThe benefits that Pakistan is likely to gain from CPEC include upgrading of the road and  deep-water port infrastructure, an enhanced capacity for energy production and a boost in  manufacturing activity due to the SEZs. Moreover, there are opportunities for technology  transfer in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan through foreign direct investment (FDI)  or through collaborative arrangements. Also, the initiative provides an opportunity to  position Pakistan as a major transit point connecting the Eurasian region with South Asia  and Southeast Asia, which is much needed for the country’s economic growth.

Another article summarizes the government’s point of view that  CPEC loans for infrastructure are concessional loans with low interest rates and that “energy- related projects in the CPEC can prove to be very helpful for “overcoming the energy shortages”  and increasing the GDP growth rate.    One paper notes that the Chinese embassy in Islamabad  emphasizes that “the   $42\\%$   of foreign-debt of Pakistan is from multilateral financial institutions  such as the IMF and World Bank.   $18\\%$   of the debt is from the Paris Club. Chinese preferential  loans only account for  $10\\%$   of [Pakistan’s] whole foreign debt and offer a much lower rate in the  form of concessional loans rather than commercial bank loans.” 128   "}

Estimates by the Inter-American  Development Bank as of November 14, 2017, indicated that Latin America and the Caribbean  together needed an additional  $\\S120$   billion to   $\\mathbb{\\S}150$   billion per year in investment to close their  infrastructure gap.  According to the CBD, “[w]ith global development assistance from  traditional partners drying up, Caribbean countries have readily grasped Beijing’s offer of  easy financing.” 4    "}

Describing the strategic geopolitical and\neconomic goals behind the $4 trillion T&T’s BRI MoU, Prime Minister Keith Rowley stated:\n\nWe told them we need your investment and you need our location in the Caribbean...

Legal and Policy Framework\n\nThere are a number of media and official Chinese reports on various Caribbean countries signing\nBRI agreements with China.° The text of these agreements, however, does not appear to be\npublically available.\n\nFor example, BRI funding in Barbados, in addition to projects related to maritime and air\ntransportation and infrastructure, was reportedly expected to include modern agriculture,\nmarine economy, renewable energy sources, culture and sports-themed tourism, medical\nservices, and health.”\n\nChina’s ambassador to Jamaica has said that BRI’s projects in Jamaica focus on infrastructure,\ntrade, finance, and people-to-people exchanges.’ The MoU signed with Antigua and Barbuda in\nJune 1018 reportedly “mentions projects such as roads, bridges, civil aviation, ports, energy and\ntelecommunications.” Similarly, Grenada’s September 2018 MoU appears to focus “on\n\n3 Daisy Margaret Jane Streatfeild, More Than 230 Million Reasons to Invest in Sustainable Infrastructure, Hablemos\nde Sostenibilidad Y Cambio Climatico (blog), Inter-American Dev.

Introduction\n\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was launched in Kazakhstan in 2013,! is being\nactively implemented in Russia and other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Working with\nthese countries, China is focusing on two out of three major components of the Initiative, namely\nthe land-based Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), comprising six development corridors, and the\nPolar Silk Road, a northern sea route.2 Apart from Russia, these countries are landlocked, and\nthus are not involved in the third BRI component, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.3\n\nThe SREB refers to land-based trade corridors linking Asia and Europe by roads, railways, and\npipelines. The New Eurasian Land Bridge Economic Corridor (NELBEC) and the China-\nMongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC), both of which go through Russia, are two of the\nsix corridors of the BRI.5\n\nAccording to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker, since 2005,\nChina had invested US$34.76 billion in Russia.* The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian\nFederation lists official statistics of Sino-Russian cooperation; te that in 2019, bilateral trade\nreached US$110.9 billion. In the first half of 2020 (the latest data available), the trade between two\ncountries amounted to US$49.15 billion.”\n\nIn addition to Russia, BRI projects extend to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), created in\n2014 to promote the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within its five member\nstates, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.’ The Joint Declaration on\nCooperation in Coordinating Development of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Silk Road\nEconomic Belt, signed in 2015,° serves as the framework for partnering between China and the\nEAEU, as well as for bilateral agreements between China and individual member states of the\nUnion.

Introduction  \nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was launched in Kazakhstan in 2013,  is being  actively implemented in Russia and other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Working with  these countries, China is focusing on two out of three major components of the Initiative, namely  the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), comprising six development corridors, and the  Polar Silk Road, a northern sea route.  Apart from Russia, these countries are landlocked, and  thus are not involved in the third BRI component, the 21 st  Century Maritime Silk Road.   \nThe SREB refers to land-based trade corridors linking Asia and Europe by roads, railways, and  pipelines.  The New Eurasian Land Bridge Economic Corridor (NELBEC) and the China- Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC), both of which go through Russia, are two of the  six corridors of the BRI.   \nAccording to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker, since 2005,  China had invested   $\\mathbf{US}\\S34.76$   billion in Russia.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian  Federation lists official statistics of Sino-Russian cooperation; te that in 2019, bilateral trade  reached  $\\mathrm{US}\\Phi110.9$   billion. In the first half of 2020 (the latest data available), the trade between two  countries amounted to US\\$49.15 billion.   \nIn addition to Russia, BRI projects extend to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), created in  2014 to promote the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within its five member  states, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.   The Joint Declaration on  Cooperation in Coordinating Development of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Silk Road  Economic Belt, signed in 2015,  serves as the framework for partnering between China and the  EAEU, as well as for bilateral agreements between China and individual member states of the  Union. Under this framework and such bilateral agreements, China and the EAEU agreed to work  on joint projects in infrastructure and trade facilitation. It was believed that cooperation would  be beneficial for both sides,  regardless of the fact that the Chinese initiative is focused on broad  free trade zones, while the Eurasian Economic Union provides for the protection of domestic  markets from external players and a tariff-free zone only for its members.  Even though the most  recent strategic document for the development of the EAEU does not mention the BRI,   member  states agreed to enforce the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation between the EAEU  and China,  Which is a prior agreement regulates the entire structure of trade and economic  relations between the Member States and the PRC. Some analysts argue that inherited differences  between Chinese and Russian projects and politically boosted integration plans ungrounded in  economic necessity could potentially cause serious friction between the two sides.

Debt Issues\n\nAccording to recent report of the Center for Global Development, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are\namong eight BRI recipient countries that are at a high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans.“\n\nObservers have noticed the general trend of BRI projects using low-interest loans as opposed to\naid grants. Most BRI investments involved non-transparent bidding processes, which enable local\nauthorities to capitalize through corrupt practices, and which involved contracts requiring the\nuse of Chinese firms and equipment, and often the employment of Chinese workforce as well.\nThe resulting inflated costs at times lead to canceled projects and political backlash.*®\n\nObservers also noted that the poorest countries of the region, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are\nvulnerable to debt shocks, as they borrow under unfavorable conditions to finance BRI-related\ninfrastructure projects. Reportedly, in 2019 China held 40% or more of both countries’ foreign\ndebts.4° Some publications expressed alarm about the implications of the BRI for these countries’\ndebt sustainability.”\n\n3. Financing of Projects\n\nExperts note that Chinese credit is much easier to obtain than traditional World Bank or\nInternational Monetary Fund loans. Simultaneously, borrowing from China is non-transparent,\nand outcomes are subject of individual negotiations and in some cases political decisions.*®\n\nTajik National University Professor Safovudin Dzhaborov describes the practice of financing BRI\nprojects as “predatory lending,” which he argues applies to “a bilateral loan transaction between\ntwo states that, in addition to paying back the loan principal and interest, prompts the borrowing\ncountry to make statements containing certain promises and/or make economic or political\nconcessions favoring the lender country or its agent, company or representative.” 49\n\n# Jonathan Hillman & Matthew P.

Debt Issues  \nAccording to recent report of the Center for Global Development, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are  among eight BRI recipient countries that are at a high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans.    \nObservers have noticed the general trend of BRI projects using low-interest loans as opposed to  aid grants. Most BRI investments involved non-transparent bidding processes, which enable local  authorities to capitalize through corrupt practices, and which involved contracts requiring the  use of Chinese firms and equipment, and often the employment of Chinese workforce as well.  The resulting inflated costs at times lead to canceled projects and political backlash.     \nObservers also noted that the poorest countries of the region, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are  vulnerable to debt shocks, as they borrow under unfavorable conditions to finance BRI-related  infrastructure projects. Reportedly, in 2019 China held   $40\\%$   or more of both countries’ foreign  debts.  Some publications expressed alarm about the implications of the BRI for these countries’  debt sustainability.      \n3.  Financing of Projects  \nExperts note that Chinese credit is much easier to obtain than traditional World Bank or  International Monetary Fund loans. Simultaneously, borrowing from China is non-transparent,  and outcomes are subject of individual negotiations and in some cases political decisions.   \nTajik National University Professor Safovudin Dzhaborov describes the practice of financing BRI  projects as “predatory lending,” which he argues applies to “a bilateral loan transaction between  two states that, in addition to paying back the loan principal and interest, prompts the borrowing  country to make statements containing certain promises and/or make economic or political  concessions favoring the lender country or its agent, company or representative.” 49    "}

COSCO’s interest in the\nPort of Piraeus began in 2008 when a subsidiary of COSCO won a 35-year concession\nto operate one of the port’s container terminals, which became the Piraeus Container\nTerminal (PCT). Following the concession, PCT became one of the fastest-growing\ncontainer terminals in Europe, and in 2019, it became Europe’s fourth busiest container\nterminal in terms of total container throughput. In 2016, COSCO acquired a majority\nstake in the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), which manages all other operations in the\nPort of Piraeus, including passenger and car terminals, and an additional container\nterminal. The apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have\nattracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors\nin Greece. The commercial success of Piraeus under COSCO management\nnotwithstanding, there appears to have been some resistance from Greek political\nleadership and labor groups to the initial concession and subsequent acquisition of the\nOLP by COSCO. The initial concession agreement was also the subject of proceedings\nbefore the European Commission, which found that certain provisions thereof\nconstitute unlawful state aid under European Union law.\n\nI.

COSCO’s interest in the  Port of Piraeus began in 2008 when a subsidiary of COSCO won a 35-year concession  to operate one of the port’s container terminals, which became the Piraeus Container  Terminal (PCT). Following the concession, PCT became one of the fastest-growing  container terminals in Europe, and in 2019, it became Europe’s fourth busiest container  terminal in terms of total container throughput. In 2016, COSCO acquired a majority  stake in the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), which manages all other operations in the  Port of Piraeus, including passenger and car terminals, and an additional container  terminal. The apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have  attracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors  in Greece. The commercial success of Piraeus under COSCO management  notwithstanding, there appears to have been some resistance from Greek political  leadership and labor groups to the initial concession and subsequent acquisition of the  OLP by COSCO. The initial concession agreement was also the subject of proceedings  before the European Commission, which found that certain provisions thereof  constitute unlawful state aid under European Union law.   \nI.  Introduction  \nA.  Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Greece  \nWhile Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe is mainly in the larger European  economies (in particular, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy), it appears that  Greece and several Balkan countries have received the bulk of the Chinese investments that are  specifically within the scope of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was officially launched  in 2013.    \nChinese seaport investments in Greece is a subject of major importance for observers of the  Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) due to its commercial and possibly strategic implications.  Since 2008, the Chinese state-owned enterprise COSCO Shipping (COSCO) and its subsidiaries  have won concessions and made acquisitions that enabled COSCO to be the controlling actor in  the operation of Greece’s largest commercial port, the Port of Piraeus, until at least the year 2047.  COSCO, which among its subsidiaries has China’s largest container shipping company, has made  particularly significant investments in the development of the container terminals in the port,  making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing major container ports since 2008 and Europe’s fourth  busiest container port in 2019 in terms of container volume handled.  Although they began before  the announcement of the BRI, in the relevant literature COSCO Shipping’s investments in the  Port of Piraeus are generally considered as being associated with the BRI, particularly the  $^{\\prime\\prime}21^{\\mathrm{st}}$    Century Maritime Silk Road” strategic trade objective.  The apparent commercial success of the  project and its financial scale arguably makes COSCO’s investment in Piraeus the most significant  among several other Chinese investments in Mediterranean ports in other countries.

The actual container throughput of the entire port  was estimated to be approximately 433,000 TEU in 2008.  After the concession, PCT became  Europe’s fastest-growing container terminal in terms of throughput, with its throughput  increasing to 2.7 million TEU by 2012, and to 5.2 million TEU by 2019.

UK  businesses in China have found the most success in the consumer, pharmaceutical, and  automotive sectors, along with financial services, although it should be noted that the export of  UK financial services to China only accounted for  $0.4\\%$   of UK financial exports in 2018.
