Parliamentary inquiry is the main procedure at the disposal of  members of parliament to conduct in-depth research and examinations of matters that  are of interest to the political and legislative process. Parliamentary inquiries are  conducted by ad hoc committees of inquiry that are formed and mandated specifically  to examine the subject matter of the parliamentary inquiry and prepare a report that is  then debated in a plenary session. Minutes of the committees and their final reports are  published and publicly available. Committees of inquiry have the power to request  information from public and private parties, however, they lack the power to compel  persons to testify or disclose information. The mandates of committees of inquiry must  be of a limited term, and state secrets and trade secrets cannot be the subject matter of  inquiry. The Parliament is also forbidden by the Constitution from launching a  parliamentary inquiry into a subject that is directly relevant to the judiciary’s use of its  powers in an ongoing case. Apart from ad hoc committees of inquiry, the standing  Committee for the Examination of Human Rights has investigative powers similar to  committees of inquiry in the field of human rights practices and complaints. Individual  members of parliament may use their right of inquiry through the procedure of a  written question, which is a formal inquiry about actions of the executive branch that  the respondent presidential deputy or minister must answer in 15 days.
