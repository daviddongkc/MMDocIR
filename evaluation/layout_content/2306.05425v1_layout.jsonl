Nevertheless, the current availability of vision-language instruction-response pairs in terms of quantity, diversity, and creativity remains lim- ited, posing challenges to the generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present M ult I - M odal  I n- C ontext  I nstruction  T uning ( MIMIC-IT ), a dataset comprising 2.8 million multimodal instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instruc- tions derived from images and videos.

The instruction-response collection process, dubbed as  Syphus , is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline that combines human expertise with GPT’s capabilities.
