Enabling models to combine disjoint pieces of textual evidence would extend the scope of machine comprehension methods, but currently no resources exist to train and test this capability. We propose a novel task to encourage the development of models for text understanding across multiple documents and to investigate the limits of existing methods. In our task, a model learns to seek and com- bine evidence – effectively performing multi- hop, alias multi-step, inference. We devise a methodology to produce datasets for this task, given a collection of query-answer pairs and thematically linked documents. Two datasets from different domains are induced,   and we identify potential pitfalls and devise circum- vention strategies. We evaluate two previ- ously proposed competitive models and ﬁnd that one can integrate information across doc- uments.

Conversely, these results also show that the models’ answer selec- tion process is not robust to the introduction of un- related documents with type-consistent candidates.

{"layout": 118, "type": "text", "text": "Related Datasets End-to-end text-based QA has witnessed a surge in interest with the advent of large- scale datasets, which have been assembled based on F REEBASE  (Berant et al., 2013; Bordes et al., 2015), W IKIPEDIA  (Yang et al., 2015; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Hewlett et al., 2016), web search queries (Nguyen et al., 2016), news articles (Her- mann et al., 2015; Onishi et al., 2016), books (Hill et al., 2016; Paperno et al., 2016), science ex- ams (Welbl et al., 2017), and trivia (Boyd-Graber et al., 2012; Dunn et al., 2017). Besides  Trivi- aQA  (Joshi et al., 2017), all these datasets are con- ﬁned to single documents, and RC typically does not require a combination of multiple independent facts. In contrast, W IKI H OP  and M ED H OP  are speciﬁ- cally designed for cross-document RC and multi- step inference. There exist other multi-hop RC re- sources, but they are either very limited in size, such as the  FraCaS  test suite, or based on synthetic language (Weston et al., 2016). TriviaQA  partly involves multi-step reasoning, but the complexity largely stems from parsing compositional questions. Our datasets center around compositional inference from comparatively simple queries and the cross- document setup ensures that multi-step inference goes beyond resolving co-reference.

{"layout": 119, "type": "text", "text": "Compositional Knowledge Base Inference Combining multiple facts is common for structured knowledge resources which formulate facts using ﬁrst-order logic. KB inference methods include Inductive Logic Programming (Quinlan, 1990; Pazzani et al., 1991; Richards and Mooney, 1991) and probabilistic relaxations to logic like Markov Logic (Richardson and Domingos, 2006; Schoen- mackers et al., 2008). These approaches suffer from limited coverage and inefﬁcient inference, though efforts to circumvent sparsity have been under- taken (Schoenmackers et al., 2008; Schoenmackers et al., 2010). A more scalable approach to compos- ite rule learning is the Path Ranking Algorithm (Lao and Cohen, 2010; Lao et al., 2011), which performs random walks to identify salient paths between entities. Gardner et al. (2013) circumvent these sparsity problems by introducing synthetic links via dense latent embeddings. Several other methods have been proposed, using composition functions such as vector addition (Bordes et al., 2014), RNNs (Neelakantan et al., 2015; Das et al., 2017), and memory networks (Jain, 2016).

That is, they work as part of a pipeline, and either rely on the output of a previous IE step (Banko et al., 2007), or on direct human annotation (Bollacker et al., 2008) which tends to be costly and biased in cov- erage. However, recent neural RC methods (Seo et al., 2017a; Shen et al., 2017) have demonstrated that end-to-end language understanding approaches can infer answers directly from text – sidestepping in- termediate query parsing and IE steps. Our work aims to evaluate whether end-to-end multi-step RC models can indeed operate on raw text documents only – while performing the kind of inference most commonly associated with logical inference meth- ods operating on structured knowledge.

(2015) have demonstrated that exploit- ing information from other related documents based on lexical semantic similarity is beneﬁcial for re- ranking answers in open-domain non-factoid QA. Jansen et al. (2017) chain textual background re- sources for science exam QA and provide multi- sentence answer explanations. Beyond, a rich col- lection of neural models tailored towards multi-step RC has been developed. Memory networks (We- ston et al., 2015; Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2016) deﬁne a model class that iteratively attends over textual memory items, and they show promising performance on synthetic tasks requiring multi-step reasoning (Weston et al., 2016). One common characteristic of neural multi-hop models is their rich structure that enables matching and in- teraction between question, context, answer candi- dates and combinations thereof (Peng et al., 2015; Weissenborn, 2016; Xiong et al., 2017; Liu and Perez, 2017), which is often iterated over several times (Sordoni et al., 2016; Neumann et al., 2016; Seo et al., 2017b; Hu et al., 2017) and may contain trainable stopping mechanisms (Graves, 2016; Shen et al., 2017). All these methods show promise for single-document RC, and by design should be capa- ble of integrating multiple facts across documents. However, thus far they have not been evaluated for a cross-document multi-step RC task – as in this work.
