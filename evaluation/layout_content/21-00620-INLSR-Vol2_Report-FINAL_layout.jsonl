Authorities refuse to  release the names of CBI beneficiaries or applicants, citing privacy concerns, but the government  has launched inquiries into whether any prior beneficiaries should have their citizenships  revoked.  On October 7, 2020, the ROC government announced the council of ministers decided  to initiate revocation of ROC citizenship for seven individuals and their 12 dependents  naturalized through the CBI program.  Skeptics doubt the likely efficacy of the inquiries, citing  the lack of transparency and prior corruption in the program.  Moreover, legal authorities for  revocation are not clear.  On October 20, 2020, the EC announced it is launching infringement  proceedings against Cyprus regarding its CBI scheme, warning such schemes violate EU law, in  part because they do not require a sufficiently meaningful attachment to the country granting  citizenship.  These proceedings continue even though the CBI program was terminated.  ", "page_idx": 85, "bbox": [72, 280.17706298828125, 543, 541.8662109375], "page_size": [612.0, 792.0]}
