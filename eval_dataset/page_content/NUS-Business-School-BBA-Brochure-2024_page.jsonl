Keep an open mind and remember that some  of the most valuable sources of learning  happens outside of the classrooms with  programmes such as NOC which will do  nothing but enrich your NUS experience. \nFlip to Page 10, and you will discover the NUS  Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme, aimed to  cultivate your entrepreneurial spirit. Immerse  yourself in this transformative experience —  intern in a technology-based startup, while  concurrently pursuing part-time courses at  reputable universities. It’s your opportunity to  shape your entrepreneurial journey and make an  impact on a global scale. \nThe image consists of two parts.
