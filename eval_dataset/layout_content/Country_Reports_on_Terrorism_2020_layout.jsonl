Together with international partners, the United States has responded  to the evolving threat, including by expanding the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, which now  counts 83 members.  The Defeat-ISIS Coalition worked to consolidate gains in Iraq and Syria,  while broadening efforts to counter the growing ISIS threat in West Africa and the Sahel.  In  March the United States designated the new leader of ISIS, Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal- Rahman al-Mawla, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).  U.S.-led military  operations in 2020 resulted in the deaths of Qassim al-Rimi, the emir of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian  Peninsula (AQAP), and of senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) leaders in Syria.  The United States continued  to address threats posed by state-sponsored terrorism, sanctioning Iran-supported groups such as  Iraq-based Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq and Bahrain-based Saraya al-Mukhtar.  Nine countries across the  Western Hemisphere and Europe took significant steps in 2020 to designate, ban, or otherwise  restrict Hizballah — following the lead of four other governments that took similar actions the  previous year.  Reflecting the growing threat from racially or ethnically motivated violent  extremism (REMVE), the Department of State also designated a white supremacist terrorist  organization for the first time in 2020, imposing sanctions against the Russian Imperial  Movement (RIM) and three of its leaders in April.
