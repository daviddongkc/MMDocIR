The Group sells fashion\njewellery and is therefore subject to\nchanging consumer demands and\nfashion trends. This increases the risk\nthat, as trends change, products may\neither need to be sold at a discount\nbelow their recorded cost, or ultimately\ndisposed of for zero value. Estimating\nthe level of provisioning for obsolete\ninventory by the Group at product\nlevel, and therefore the value of\ninventories, requires consideration of\nthe ageing and condition of products\non hand, historic trends in write-offs,\ninventory turnover, seasonality of\ninventory and anticipated future sales.\nSuch judgements may have a\nsignificant impact on the Group’s\nprovisioning, and therefore the overall\ncarrying value of inventories,\nnecessitating our audit effort thereon.\n\nGroup’s policy for the shrinkage\nprovision is calculated based on the\ninventory counts performed and\nexpected misappropriation of\ninventories as a percentage of sales.\nWe focus on the shrinkage\nprovisioning calculation which is largely\nmanual and is therefore at greater risk\nof error.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s inventory\nprovisioning policies against the requirements of the\naccounting standards.\n\nAssessing the historical accuracy of the Group’s\ninventory provision against actual outcomes, to inform\nour evaluation of the current year provisioning and key\njudgements;\n\nChallenging the Group's judgements within their\nobsolete inventory provisioning, particularly the extent\nto which aged and seasonal inventory can be sold,\ntaking into account our knowledge of the industry and\npast Group performance;\n\nAnalysing current and historic trends in inventory\nturnover and ageing to identify indicators of slow-\nmoving or obsolete inventory and therefore those\ninventory items at higher risk of obsolescence. We\ncompared this to the Group's inventory ageing report.\n\nChecking the integrity of the Group's inventory ageing\nreport at 28 June 2020, as a key input used in the\nobsolete inventory provisioning, by comparing on a\nsample basis inventory age per the report to purchase\ninvoices.\n\nAttending a sample of inventory counts across the\nGroup's store and warehouse locations\n\n- to observe the condition of a sample of products held.\nWe did this to check the condition of products assumed\nin their recorded inventory value.\n\n- to observe the Group's shrinkage process.\n\nAnalysing the inventory shrinkage provision levels by\nregion against sales, including against historical trends.\n\nAssessing the integrity of the provisioning calculations.\nThis included checking the accuracy of the formulas\nwithin the calculations.\n\nComparing a statistical sample of inventory product\nvalues recorded by the Group at year-end, to the\nGroup's post year-end recommended retail selling prices\nto identify products at risk of selling below cost.\n", "vlm_text": "The table presented outlines a key audit matter regarding the evaluation of inventories within a Group, primarily focused on fashion jewelry and related inventory risks. The table is divided into two columns: \"The key audit matter\" and \"How the matter was addressed in our audit.\"\n\n1. **The key audit matter**: \n   - The evaluation of inventories is highlighted as a key audit issue due to:\n     - The substantial size of inventories, representing 8.3% of total assets.\n     - The judgment required to assess provisioning for obsolete inventory, given the nature of fashion jewelry being subject to changing trends.\n     - The need for estimating provisioning levels, which involves assessing inventory aging, condition, turnover, and future sales.\n     - The risk of error in the shrinkage provision calculation, owing to its manual nature.\n\n2. **How the matter was addressed in our audit**:\n   - The audit procedures included:\n     - Evaluating the Group's inventory provisioning policies against accounting standards.\n     - Assessing the historical accuracy of inventory provisions.\n     - Challenging the Group's judgments on obsolete inventory provisioning.\n     - Analyzing trends in inventory turnover and aging.\n     - Checking the integrity of the inventory aging report.\n     - Attending sample inventory counts to observe product conditions and the shrinkage process.\n     - Analyzing inventory shrinkage provisions against sales.\n     - Assessing the integrity of provisioning calculations.\n     - Comparing statistical samples of inventory product values with post year-end selling prices."}
