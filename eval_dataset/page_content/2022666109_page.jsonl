Other Recent Air Quality Legal Developments  \nA bill “to require the Administrator of the EPA to revise certain ethylene oxide emissions  standards under the Clean Air Act” has been introduced in the US Senate.  A similar bill has  been introduced in the US House of Representatives.  Specifically, if enacted, either bill’s  provisions would require that regulations be revised based on results from the National Center  for Environmental Assessment report titled  Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of  Ethylene Oxide .    \nB.  Water Quality Legal Developments  \n1.  Definition of the “Waters of the United States” Under the CWA   \nThe 1972 amendments to the CWA established federal jurisdiction over “navigable waters,”  defined in the act as the “waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” 45  The CWA  does not define “waters of the United States”; rather, it provides discretion to the EPA and the  US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to define “waters of the United States” in regulations.  \n2.  US Supreme Court Decisions on “Waters of the United States” Before 2022  \nThree US Supreme Court decisions before 2022 addressed the definition and scope of “waters of  the United States.” In 1985, the Court in  United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc. ,  deferred  to the US Army Corps of Engineers’’ assertion that CWA jurisdiction extended to certain  wetlands that were adjacent to other jurisdictional waters because they were “inseparably bound  up” with navigable waters. In 2001, the Court in  Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v.  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  rejected the Corps’ claim of federal jurisdiction over non-navigable  and isolated ponds as lacking sufficient connection to traditional navigable waters.    \nThe Court most recently interpreted the term “waters of the United States” in  Rapanos v. United  States  in 2006.  A four-justice plurality opinion articulated by Justice Antonin Scalia held that the  term “navigable waters” under the CWA includes only relatively permanent or flowing bodies  of water, not intermittent or ephemeral flows of water.  Additionally, only those wetlands with  a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the United States in their own right  or are adjacent to such waters are covered by the CWA.  However, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s  opinion concurring in the judgment found that, to constitute “navigable waters” under the CWA,  a water or wetland must possess a “significant nexus” to waters that are navigable in fact or could  reasonably be so made.  Justice Kennedy also stated that a significant nexus exists when a  wetland “either alone or in connection with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly  impacts the chemical, physical, and biological integrity” of a traditionally navigable water.

The Environment Act 2021  \nOn November 9, 2021, following a long approval process in the UK’s Parliament (hereinafter  Parliament), the Environment Act 2021 gained royal assent.  Described by former Environment  Secretary George Eustice as delivering the “most ambitious environmental programme of any  country on earth,” the Environment Act 2021 is intended to operate as a new framework to  enhance and protect the environment.   \nFollowing “Brexit,” environmental protections were a subject of concern, since EU laws no longer  applied, however, in the UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a part of BREXIT  negotiations, required the UK to maintain a level of environmental protections equivalent to the  protections in force on December 31, 2020. . New legislation relating to environmental areas such  as water and clean air needed to be established. In approving the Environment Act 2021,  environmental protections became enshrined into law, and the legislation provides for the  creation of new powers.  The Environment Act 2021 has eight sections. Specifically, parts 1 and  2 concern environmental protections, while parts 3 through 7 concern waste and resource  efficiency, air quality, water, nature and biodiversity, and conservation covenants. Part 8 includes  miscellaneous provisions such as chemical regulation.   \nThis report focuses on the act’s key features concerning environmental governance, water, and  air quality.   \nC.  Environmental Governance  \n1.  Environmental Targets  \nPart 1 of the Environment Act 2021 includes the creation of legally binding environmental targets.  \na.  Long-Term Targets  \nThe Environment Act 2021 stipulates that the secretary of State may create regulations to   set long- term targets relating to any matters concerning the natural environment or people’s enjoyment  of the natural environment.  The secretary must set long-term targets regarding at least one  matter within each “priority area.” 100  For the purposes of the act, the phrase “priority areas” refers  to air quality, water, biodiversity as well as resource efficiency, and waste reduction.  “Long- term” for the purposes of the Environment Act 2021 is no less than 15 years after the date on  which the target was initially set.
