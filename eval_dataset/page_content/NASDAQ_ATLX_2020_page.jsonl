Forward-looking statements for Brazil Minerals, Inc. reflect current expectations, as of the date of this Annual Report, and involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward- looking statements as a result of various factors. Factors that could cause future results to materially differ from the recent results or those projected in forward- looking statements include, among others: unprofitable efforts resulting not only from the failure to discover mineral deposits, but also from finding mineral deposits that, though present, are insufficient in quantity and quality to return a profit from production; market fluctuations; government regulations, including regulations relating to royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals, and environmental protection; competition; the loss of services of key personnel; unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of infrastructure as well as general economic conditions. \nOverview \nBrazil Minerals, Inc. with its subsidiaries (“Brazil Minerals”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is a mineral exploration company currently primarily focused on the development of our two   $100\\%$  -owned hard-rock lithium projects.. Our initial goal is to be able to enter commercial production of spodumene concentrate, a lithium bearing commodity. \nWe also have  $100\\%$  -ownership of projects in other highly strategic minerals: rare earths, titanium, and nickel/cobalt. We have mining concessions and other mineral rights for diamonds, and in one of these areas we also mine and sell sand for construction usage, which was our primary source of our revenues in 2020. \nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we own approximately   $60\\%$   of Apollo Resources Corporation, a private company primarily focused on the development of its initial iron mine. We own approximately  $30\\%$   of Jupiter Gold Corporation, a company focused on the development of gold projects and of a quartzite mine, and whose common shares are quoted on otcmarkets.com under the symbol “JUPGF”.

Mineral property acquisition costs, including\nlicenses and lease payments, are capitalized. Although we have taken steps to verify title to mineral properties in which it has an interest, these procedures\ndo not guarantee our rights. Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects.\n\nImpairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows\nestimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amount.

On an\nannual basis, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we review our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment by first assessing qualitative\nfactors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances makes it more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its\ncarrying amount. If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the intangible\nasset is further tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow.

Such properties may be subject to prior agreements or transfers and title may be affected by undetected defects. \nImpairment losses are recorded on mineral properties used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets’ carrying amount. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not recognize any impairment losses related to mineral properties held. \nImpairment of Intangible Assets with Indefinite Useful Lives \nWe account for intangible assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”). ASC 350 requires that intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized, but instead be evaluated for impairment at least annually. On an annual basis, in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, we review our intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances makes it more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the intangible asset is further tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow.

(the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended\nDecember 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all\nmaterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of\nthe two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\n\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\n\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the\nfinancial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability\nto continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any\nadjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial\nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor\nwere we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.

As of December 31,\n2020, carrying value of property and equipment and intangible assets were $89,726 and $407,467, respectively.\n\nAuditing the valuation of long-lived assets involved complex judgment due to the significant estimation required in determining the recoverability or fair\nvalue of the long-lived assets. Specifically, the cash flow forecasts were sensitive to significant assumptions about future market and economic conditions.\nSignificant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included sales volume, pricing, cost of labor, marketing spending, general and\nadministrative expenses, tax rates, as applicable.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of the controls over the Company’s annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets and tested the future cash flows of\nthe long-lived assets based on our risk assessments. Our audit procedures included, among others, comparing significant inputs to observable third party\nand industrial sources, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s projected financial information by comparing to observable average market\nprices of the Company’s products. We reviewed most recent available technical reports about the Company’s mineral projects.

(the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. \nGoing Concern Uncertainty \nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. \nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.
