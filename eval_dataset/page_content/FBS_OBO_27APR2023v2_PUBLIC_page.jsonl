This objective supports the Proactive Risk Management collective responsibility as it aims to manage enterprise risk at the Bureau level. In addition, a risk management governance framework directly supports Goal 4 of the Joint Strategic Plan to encourage a culture of managing risk rather than avoiding it. \n• Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 4.2 Risk Considerations:   There are two primary risks to achieving this objective. First, the objectivity and independence of the steering committee, which will prioritize implementation of OBO’s risk management governance structure, will be critical as OBO establishes this new effort. To maintain the committee’s independence, OBO will develop a charter that clearly outlines the role of committee members and stakeholders. Additionally, stakeholders across OBO may have varying risk tolerance levels and varied understandings of what enterprise risk management means to the Bureau. By developing a communication and training plan, the committee can articulate what ERM means to OBO and how managers can enact it. "}
