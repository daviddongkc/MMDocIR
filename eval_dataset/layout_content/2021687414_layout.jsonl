COSCO’s interest in the  Port of Piraeus began in 2008 when a subsidiary of COSCO won a 35-year concession  to operate one of the port’s container terminals, which became the Piraeus Container  Terminal (PCT). Following the concession, PCT became one of the fastest-growing  container terminals in Europe, and in 2019, it became Europe’s fourth busiest container  terminal in terms of total container throughput. In 2016, COSCO acquired a majority  stake in the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), which manages all other operations in the  Port of Piraeus, including passenger and car terminals, and an additional container  terminal. The apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have  attracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors  in Greece. The commercial success of Piraeus under COSCO management  notwithstanding, there appears to have been some resistance from Greek political  leadership and labor groups to the initial concession and subsequent acquisition of the  OLP by COSCO. The initial concession agreement was also the subject of proceedings  before the European Commission, which found that certain provisions thereof  constitute unlawful state aid under European Union law.
