Certain loans made  by Cat Financial and various financing extended to Cat Financial  are made at variable rates that use LIBOR as a benchmark for  establishing the interest rate.

On November 18, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (\"IBA\"),  the administrator of USD LIBOR, announced plans to consult on  its intention to cease the publication of all GBP , EUR, CHF and JPY  LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on  December 31, 2021. On November 30, 2020, IBA, with the support  of the United States Federal Reserve and the FCA, announced plans  to consult on ceasing publication of USD LIBOR on December 31,  2021 for only the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors,  and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. While the  November 30 announcement extends the transition period to  June 2023, the United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued  a statement advising banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances  by the end of 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to  exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established if LIBOR  continues to exist after 2021 or alternative reference rates to be  established. The consequences of these developments cannot be  entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the market  value for or value of LIBOR-linked securities, loans, derivatives, and  other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due  to Cat Financial, as well as the revenue and expenses associated  with those securities, loans and financial instruments.

Other income/expense in 2021 was income of   $\\S\\,1.8\\,14$   billion,  compared with expense of  $\\S44$   million in 2020. The change was  primarily due to mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of  pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021,  compared with mark-to-market losses in 2020. Favorable impacts  from foreign currency exchange gains (losses) and lower pension  and OPEB plan costs also contributed to the change. The company experienced foreign currency exchange net losses  in 2020, compared with net gains in 2021. z  The provision for income taxes for 2021 reflected an annual  effective tax rate of 22.9 percent compared with 27 .8 percent  for 2020, excluding the discrete items discussed in the following  paragraph. The decrease from 2020 was primarily related to  changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective. The provision for income taxes for 2021 also included the  following:  o\t A tax charge of  $\\S\\uparrow\\S0$   million related to \\$833 million of pension  and OPEB mark-to-market gains in 2021, compared to a   $\\S82$   million tax benefit related to   $\\S383$   million of mark-to- market losses in 2020. o\t A tax benefit of  $\\S36$   million to reflect changes in estimates  related to prior year’s U.S. taxes in 2021 compared to   $\\S80$   million in 2020. o\t A tax benefit of   $\\S63$   million in 2021, compared with   $\\S49$   million in 2020, for the settlement of stock-based  compensation awards with associated tax deductions in  excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.  o\t A tax benefit of  $\\S38$   million in 2021 to recognize U.S. capital  losses.

A loan is measured at fair  value when management determines that collection of contractual  amounts due is not probable and the loan is individually evaluated.

The most prevalent  of these unresolved actions involve disputes related to product  design, manufacture and performance liability (including claimed  asbestos exposure), contracts, employment issues, environmental  matters, intellectual property rights, taxes (other than income taxes)  and securities laws. The aggregate range of reasonably possible  losses in excess of accrued liabilities, if any, associated with these  unresolved legal actions is not material. In some cases, we cannot  reasonably estimate a range of loss because there is insufficient  information regarding the matter. However, we believe there is no  more than a remote chance that any liability arising from these  matters would be material. Although it is not possible to predict  with certainty the outcome of these unresolved legal actions, we  believe that these actions will not individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of  operations, financial position or liquidity.
