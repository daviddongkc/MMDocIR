We responded to the challenge with  speed and agility, and have emerged stronger, with our  model now proven to be able to adapt to even extreme  shocks. From a highly centralized model, with large  campuses accommodating thousands of employees,  we were able to switch to an extreme form of distributed  \ndelivery, with  $90\\%$   of our 448,000-strong workforce enabled  to work remotely, in a matter of days.  \nWe not just enabled remote access for our associates but  also calibrated our project management framework and  security posture so that work could be properly allocated,  governed, and reported, while maintaining our stringent  security controls, and pivoted into a new operating model  that we call Secure Borderless Workspaces™ (SBWS™). \nUsing SBWS, we have been able to continue supporting  our customers not only in their mission critical operations  but also their transformation al projects, just as before,  without any slippages. \nA New Location Agnostic Operating Model \nThe Secure Borderless Workspaces model is an extension  of the Open Agile Workspaces framework that powered  the innovative Location Independent Agile™ model that  we pioneered two years ago. It leverages all our prior  investments, and incorporates the learnings and best  practices around network management, a standard service  delivery environment, cloud-enabled governance processes,  heavy use of digital collaboration tools,  and an internal  Security Operations Center benchmarked to the best  in the industry. \nEven though these are early days, the outcomes from  our new model have been impressive. Our cloud-based  project monitoring system has been tracking the progress  of over 23,000 ongoing projects on a real time basis,  \nensuring that our customers continue to experience the same  high quality of delivery and certainty of outcomes that they  have come to expect of TCS. There are even pockets where  we have witnessed improved velocity, throughput,  and productivity. \nSBWS will continue to be an integral part of our new  operating model and represents the future of work.  It helps TCSers enjoy a better quality of life, while making  TCS’ service delivery more resilient as the fully distributed  model is better suited for business continuity.  \nOur customers are comfortable with this model and want us  to take more work that others are not able to handle. This has  given us the confidence to come out with a bold new Vision   $25\\!\\times\\!25$  . We believe that by 2025, only  $25\\%$   of our associates  will need to work out of our facilities at any point of time;  and every associate will be able to realize their potential  without spending more than  $25\\%$   of their time in a TCS office. \nPurpose-driven, Resilient, Adaptable \nWe have received over 500 emails from customers in recent  weeks, appreciating how seamlessly TCS managed the  transition to SBWS, and expressing gratitude for how our  teams went above and beyond to help keep their mission- critical systems and their business operations running under  very difficult circumstances. \nGoing through some of those notes filled me with immense  pride.

That improves our business  visibility, and brings in higher quality revenues. It also  embeds us deeper into the core of the customer’s business,  making us a strategic partner and sometimes the sole  strategic partner, raising our brand visibility.  \nWHAT DO YOU SEE AS THE KEY SPENDING THEMES  AND DRIVERS OF YOUR GROWTH IN A POST-PANDEMIC  WORLD? \nKAK:  Innovation is a timeless business theme. It will not only  continue to remain very relevant in the post-pandemic world,  but might even see acceleration in some cases in the medium  term. Even as we help customers improve their resilience  in the immediate term, we are also having conversations  on medium and longer term transformation plans.  \nNGS:  There will be a short period of dislocation in some  sectors due to the complete stalling of all economic activity,  but once things settle down, you will see spending on these  themes return. Different sectors will recover at different  rates, but technology will remain front and center of every  organization’s strategy to innovate, differentiate itself  and grow. \nKR:  In the near term, enterprises are responding to the crisis  by spending on workplace and collaboration tools, cyber- security and cloud adoption. We expect to see accelerated  rollouts of digital channels including cognitive chatbots.  Organizations are also rapidly reconfiguring their supply  chains with a \\`just in case’ orientation, for greater  diversification and localization.  \nIn the next phase, customers will want to build greater  resilience in their operations, and we expect greater interest in our Machine First approach, and ignio. You can also expect  heightened M&A activity in the next few months, and given  our experience in process and IT integration, enabling time- bound divestments and taking on commitments around  transition services, we expect to benefit from that as well. \nIn the medium and longer term, there are structural  forces acting in our favor. Technology is seen as a source  of competitive differentiation in every industry today,  and technology intensity – or spend on technology as  a percentage of revenue – is rising. That expands the market  opportunity for us. From our side, we have been steadily  expanding our addressable market by continually launching  new services, products and platforms, catering to the  priorities of an expanding set of stakeholders in the  enterprise. Between these two forces, we have immense  confidence in our ability to sustain longer term growth  \nThe image shows a design composed of two circles.

They accomplish this by  harnessing the abundance of resources – compute power,  storage, talent, market reach – created by the convergence  of intelligence, agility, automation and cloud. While this  provides a way for customers to think through their digital  transformation journeys at a business model level, TCS  followed it up with an execution framework consisting of  the Location Independent Agile model and the forward- thinking Machine First™ Delivery Model.  \n\nTCS’ Location Independent Agile model allows large  transformation al programs to be delivered by globally  distributed teams working collaboratively in an Agile  mode, resulting in signiﬁcant speed to market, reduced  risk and enhanced customer experiences. The underlying  project management methodology, governance structures,  processes and controls, and security protocols have been  extended to implement Secure Borderless Workspaces™, a  fully location-agnostic model that lends further resilience to  the delivery model.  \nConcurrently, TCS has been helping customers transform  their IT and business operations using the Machine First  approach that embeds analytics, automation and AI  deep within the enterprise to reimagine entire slices of  operations at a time to make them lighter, smarter and  more resilient. This operations transformation unlocks  signiﬁcant value, helping the enterprise fund growth and  transformation initiatives that are critical for its competitive  differentiation. \nOutcomes \nTCS’ thought leadership and investments have made it  the preferred innovation and transformation partner to  progressive enterprises across different industry verticals.  \nCustomers bank on TCS’ contextual knowledge and  solutioning capabilities to leverage new technologies to  change their business models, drive new revenue streams,  strengthen customer relationships by offering superior  experiences, or transform their operations.  \nThis has increased demand for the entire gamut of services,  solutions, products and platforms offered by TCS, resulting  in a stronger order book, more robust revenue growth,  and improved market share. These transformation al  engagements are raising TCS’ proﬁle within C-suites,  embedding its teams more deeply within customers’  businesses and resulting in greater predictability and  resilience.

The  philosophy has been to delight them by accommodating  their needs and delivering superior outcomes, and build  strong, enduring relationships. Additionally, the company  seeks to expand and deepen customer engagements by  continually looking for new areas in the customer’s business  where the company can add value, proactively invest in  building newer capabilities, and launch new services and  solutions to participate in those opportunities.  \nOver time, this has resulted in an expanding participation in  the departmental spends of a broad range of stakeholders  across the enterprise, including business heads, CMOs,  CROs, COOs, CFOs and even CEOs. It has also resulted in  a continual expansion of customer relationships in terms  of the services consumed, revenue and share of wallet, as  evidenced by the client metrics that the company reports  every quarter and every year.  \nClient metrics \nThe image is a bar chart showing the number of clients with annual revenues of $50 million and $100 million or more from fiscal years 2016 to 2020. \n\n- The dark blue bars represent $50 million and above clients.\n- The light blue sections represent $100 million and above clients.\n\nHere are the numbers for each fiscal year:\n\n- FY 2016: 37 ($100M+) and 73 ($50M+)\n- FY 2017: 35 ($100M+) and 84 ($50M+)\n- FY 2018: 38 ($100M+) and 97 ($50M+)\n- FY 2019: 44 ($100M+) and 99 ($50M+)\n- FY 2020: 49 ($100M+) and 105 ($50M+)\nSuppliers 20 \nTCS’ Sustainable Supply Chain policy and Green  Procurement policy outline its commitment to making  its supply chain more responsible and sustainable.

Rolling lockdowns and  social distancing restrictions on account of the pandemic  are expected to signiﬁcantly impact economic activity in  all major markets, and cause demand compression. In the  immediate aftermath, enterprises are expected to downscale  current investments, defer planned initiatives, cut costs and  conserve cash. While this could inject volatility into TCS’  revenue growth, the company expects to gain market share  from ensuing vendor consolidations.  \n\nDemand is expected to increase for services around digital  channels, collaboration and workplace transformation,  online learning and workforce analytics. Companies are  also expected to invest more towards building operational  \nresilience, leveraging analytics, intelligent automation,  cloud and cyber security.

In line with international practice, the  conduct of internal audit is oriented towards the review of  internal controls and risks in the company’s operations such  as software delivery, accounting and ﬁnance, procurement,  employee engagement, travel, insurance, IT processes,  including most of the subsidiaries and foreign branches. \nTCS also undergoes periodic audit by specialized third  party consultants and professionals for business speciﬁc  compliances such as quality management, service  management, information security, etc. The audit  committee reviews reports submitted by the management  and audit reports submitted by internal auditors and  statutory auditors. Suggestions for improvement are  considered and the audit committee follows up on  corrective action. The audit committee also meets TCS’  \nstatutory auditors to ascertain, inter alia, their views on the  adequacy of internal control systems and keeps the board  of directors informed of its major observations periodically. \nBased on its evaluation (as deﬁned in section 177 of  Companies Act 2013 and Clause 18 of SEBI Regulations  2015), our audit committee has concluded that, as of March  31, 2020, our internal ﬁnancial controls were adequate and  operating effectively.

One of\nthe tools that Pete has to\nempower these students is\nIgnite My Future in School,\nwhich offers lesson plans\nand study material that\nweave computational\nthinking into core curriculum subjects like math, sciences,\nand social studies.\n\n“IMFIS provides a type of learning that goes beyond\nthe classroom,” says Pete. “It empowers students to\napply computational and problem-solving thinking to\nall aspects of their lives and that’s especially valuable,\nbecause many of these students wouldn’t have had\naccess to this kind of learning before.”\n\nIn addition to being a participating teacher, Pete is also\na Learning Leader within the IMFIS teacher network.\n“I’ve been able to collaborate with educators across the\nUS, Canada and Mexico,” Pete explains, “which means\nstudents leave my classroom as global citizens.”\n\nTCS Annual Report 2019-20\n\nIn India, TCS’ ‘Lab on Bike’ is providing a similar experience\nto teachers in government schools and children from\nlow-income, disadvantaged communities. The program\nintroduces novel learning opportunities that foster a\nscientific mind-set. The Lab on Bike instructors travel to\ngovernment schools with a set of science experiment\n\nkits with which they demonstrate experiments in physics,\nchemistry and biology. The program has been implemented\nin 12 schools around Bengaluru, benefiting 1,291 students\nand 10 schools in Ahmedabad impacting 1,140 students.\n\nA key issue confronting India is the lack of literacy,\nespecially among adults.

These provisions are reviewed at the end of  each reporting date and are adjusted to reﬂect  the current best estimates.  \nThe Group uses signiﬁcant judgement to  disclose contingent liabilities.

In assessing whether the Group  is reasonably certain to exercise an option to  extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to  terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts  and circumstances that create an economic  \nincentive for the Group to exercise the option  to extend the lease, or not to exercise the  option to terminate the lease.

The weighted average incremental borrowing rate of  $7.80\\%$   has been applied to lease  liabilities recognised in the balance sheet at the date of initial application. \n\nOn application of Ind AS 116, the nature of expenses has changed from lease rent in  previous periods to depreciation cost for the right-of-use asset, and ﬁnance cost for  interest accrued on lease liability. \nThe difference between the future minimum lease rental commitments towards  non-cancellable operating leases and ﬁnance leases reported as at March 31, 2019  compared to the lease liability as accounted as at April 1, 2019 is primarily due to  inclusion of present value of the lease payments for the cancellable term of the  leases, reduction due to discounting of the lease liabilities as per the requirement of  Ind AS 116 and exclusion of the commitments for the leases to which the Company  has chosen to apply the practical expedient as per the standard. \nFinance lease \nThe Company has leases that were classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases applying Ind AS 17. For  such leases, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at  the date of initial application of Ind AS 116 is the carrying amount of the lease asset  and lease liability on the transition date as measured applying Ind AS 17. Accordingly,  an amount of  $\\mathfrak{F}25$   crore has been reclassiﬁed from property, plant and equipment to  right-of-use assets. An amount of  $\\mp6$   crore has been reclassiﬁed from other current  ﬁnancial liabilities to lease liability – current and an amount of  $\\mp53$   crore has been  reclassiﬁed from borrowings – non-current to lease liability – non-current.
