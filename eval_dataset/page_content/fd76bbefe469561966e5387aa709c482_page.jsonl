He writes:—\n“+ © + but the subject is very obscure, and studying the phenomenon in\nthe Marston [t.e., Marsden] rocks, on the coast of Durham, I found it\nimpossible to form any positive opinion on the subject.”\n\nIn 1863, in their useful “ Synopsis,” Messrs. Howse and Kirkby were\nthe first to offer an explanation of the breccias in question. After men-\ntioning the chief dislocations of the district they add :—“ But besides\nthe faults above mentioned, there are of course numerous minor breaks\naffecting the limestone, some of which possess considerable geological\ninterest. Sometimes these latter take the form of rubble or breccia\ndykes, the space between the walls of the fissure being filled irregularly\nwith large and small angular blocks of limestone, cemented together with\na calcareous paste. Remarkable examples of these occur on the voast\nbetween the Tyne and the Wear, one of the best being the “Chimney”\njust to the south of Marsden grotto. The remarkable appearances\npresented by these breccias at Marsden may, we think, be explained by\nthe filling up of large fissures and chasms with broken fragments of the\nsuperincumbent strata, and may perhaps be safely attributed to earth-\nquake action on these rocks at an early period.” $\n\nThe late Professor David Page, who had spent some years of early\nlife at Sunderland, and therefore knew the coast details well, more than\nonce in conversation with the writer expressed his acceptance of the\nearthquake theory as accounting for the Breccia-gashes.\n\nSo much, then, at present, as regards the attempts which have, so far,\nbeen made to clear up their origin. Many more suggestions have been\nmade respecting that of the Sunderland earth-shocks.\n\nVery naturally, in the first moment of local excitement, the thoughts\nof many were turned towards the collieries, many of which it was well\nknown extend widely in the Coal-Measures beneath the Permian rocks.\nIt was hinted that the shocks might have been caused by shot-firing or\n\n* “ Life, Letters, and Journals of Sir Charles Lyell, Bart.” Vol. IL, p. 42 (1831).\n\nt 6th edition (1865), p. 475.
