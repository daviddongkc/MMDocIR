Recent work has focused primarily on answering questions given some relevant document or context, and required very little general background.

To capture common sense beyond associations, we extract from C ON - CEPT N ET  ( Speer et al. ,  2017 ) multiple target concepts that have the same semantic relation to a single source concept.
