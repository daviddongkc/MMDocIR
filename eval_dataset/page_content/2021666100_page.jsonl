The Supreme Administrative Court also found that costs associated with  the mining of cryptoassets are deductible in relation to the income derived from mining. For  example, mining generally requires a lot of electricity, and thus the electricity cost for mining is  deductible, as are costs for computers and other equipment needed in the mining.   "}

The income is valued at the market\nvalue of the virtual currency at that time. The amount of income received is also the gross\nacquisition cost for the newly acquired virtual currency. The acquisition cost of the\nminer’s old virtual currency remains unchanged.

Introduction  \nThe Irish government is taking steps to make Ireland a global leader in financial services 1  and “to  demonstrate its support of the development and adoption of new technologies, including  blockchain, as a way to encourage digitalisation and foster innovation.” 2  Ireland has yet to  implement a regulatory regime for cryptoassets, instead opting for a wait-and-see approach.     \nIn 2018, the Department of Finance issued a discussion paper on virtual assets.  One of the key  considerations it noted was the need for a “clear legal & regulatory environment to ensure  compliance when investing in blockchain linked businesses [and] Guidance in relation to tax and  consumer protection matters.”5 \nThe government introduced an Intra-Departmental Working Group to identify the risks and  economic opportunities for Ireland, monitor developments into virtual currencies, and consider  whether policy recommendations are required.   \nII.  Tax Treatment of Block Rewards   \nThere is no taxation legislation or rules in Ireland that apply specifically to crypto currencies.  The  current tax structure, such as the income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax, applies to  crypto currencies and cryptoassets, with the particular tax depending upon the activities the  assets are used for and the nature of the taxpayer.  Thus, any profits and losses of cryptocurrency  transactions are accounted for using the income tax or corporation tax rule that must be  determined on the individual facts of the case.  The corporation tax does not allow companies to  prepare their accounts in crypto currencies, thus functional currencies must be used when  preparing accounts.    "}

{"page": 60, "image_path": "page_images/2021666100_60.jpg", "ocr_text": "Taxation of Cryptocurrency Block Rewards: Israel\n\nAccording to Israel’s Tax Authority, the majority of those who engage in mining and verification\nof transactions do so as an occupation.!” Such dealers are subject to YIT as noted above.!8\n\nFor example, mining and verifying of transactions in bitcoin require an investment of working\ntime and in computing equipment with extremely high processing capabilities, as well as\nelectricity consumption. Verification or approval of a transaction in virtual currency like bitcoin\ninvolve the use of digital computing mechanism for analyzing and processing of the transaction’s\ncomponents and encryption. The reward received for verification of a transaction depends on the\nspeed of processing. For example, the first person who manages to verify the transaction gets the\nhighest reward. The second gets a lower reward, and so on. The last ones to verify the transaction\nreceive a reward that is minimal and may be lower than related expenses, such as electricity and\ninvestment costs in equipment and computing, and may even yield a loss.19\n\nD. Value-Added Tax Liability for Transactions that Involve Cryptocurrency\n\nSimilar to income tax liability, for the purpose of liability for value-added tax (VAT), virtual\ncurrency is viewed as “an asset” and is taxed in accordance with relevant transaction\nclassifications under the Value-Added Tax Law, 5736-1975.20\n\nIn accordance with Circular No. 05/2018, VAT will apply to income from virtual currencies that\nderive from a business.”! Therefore,\n\n[iJndividual investors in virtual currencies are not liable for VAT, but anyone who engages\nin mining will be classified as a dealer and could be subject to VAT.

Such dealers are subject to YIT as noted above.   \nFor example, mining and verifying of transactions in bitcoin require an investment of working  time and in computing equipment with extremely high processing capabilities, as well as  electricity consumption. Verification or approval of a transaction in virtual currency like bitcoin  involve the use of digital computing mechanism for analyzing and processing of the transaction’s  components and encryption. The reward received for verification of a transaction depends on the  speed of processing. For example, the first person who manages to verify the transaction gets the  highest reward. The second gets a lower reward, and so on. The last ones to verify the transaction  receive a reward that is minimal and may be lower than related expenses, such as electricity and  investment costs in equipment and computing, and may even yield a loss.   \nD.   Value-Added Tax Liability for Transactions that Involve Cryptocurrency  \nSimilar to income tax liability, for the purpose of liability for value-added tax (VAT), virtual  currency is viewed as “an asset” and is taxed in accordance with relevant transaction  classifications under the Value-Added Tax Law, 5736-1975.     \nIn accordance with Circular No. 05/2018, VAT will apply to income from virtual currencies that  derive from a business.

Introduction  \nThe government of Jersey has opted not to introduce “a full prudential and conduct of business  regime” for cryptoassets, as it considered it was too early to regulate them, given that they are in  the early stages of development and doing so could restrict development and innovation. Instead, it followed recommendations to a 2015 consultation paper to regulate cryptoassets only  insofar as necessary to ensure compliance with anti-money laundering laws and to counter the  financing of terrorism.  Jersey’s anti-money laundering and counter-financing of terrorism  (AML/CFT) laws were extended to cover crypto currencies, with the changes coming into force  on September 26, 2016.   “Virtual currency” is defined in the Proceeds of Crime Act as a currency  rather than a commodity, thus enabling it to fall within the preexisting regulatory framework and  be regulated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC).     \nVirtual currencies were also brought within the ambit of the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order  2008,  which requires individuals operating a “money service business” to register with the JFSC 6 and comply with the jurisdiction’s AML/CFT laws if they have an annual turnover greater than  £150,000 (about US\\$210,000).  These laws require such businesses to adopt policies and  procedures to prevent and detect money laundering and terrorist financing, appoint a money  laundering compliance officer and reporting officer, and ensure that recordkeeping and customer  due diligence measures are implemented,  such as know-your-customer measures, prior to  entering into a business relationship with a person, or before conducting a “one-off” for all  transactions greater than €1,000 (about US\\$1,220).

Introduction\n\nWhile cryptocurrencies are still largely unregulated in Luxembourg, the government issued\ninstructions on the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies on July 26, 2018.! This circular establishes\nthat Luxembourg does not consider cryptocurrencies to be an actual currency. Rather,\ncryptocurrencies are considered to be an intangible asset for tax purposes.”\n\nII. Taxation of Non-professional Traders\n\nBuying and selling cryptocurrency is considered to be “speculation” as defined by Article 99bis\nof the Income Tax Law.’ As such, profit from such an operation is only taxable if the sale of\ncryptocurrency occurred six months or less after the purchase, and the taxpayer earned more than\n500 euros (approximately US$612) in total profits from speculation during the civil year.‘ If there\nis more than six months between the purchase and sale of an amount of cryptocurrency, profit\nfrom that operation is not taxed.\n\nIII. Taxation of Professional Traders and Miners\n\nA person’s cryptocurrency trading activity is considered a commercial activity under the Income\nTax Law if it is a “for-profit independent activity exercised on a permanent basis and participating\nin general economic life.”> The 2018 circular states that “these conditions are regularly fulfilled”\nin cases involving cryptocurrency mining or online cryptocurrency exchange markets.° Income\nderived from these activities is therefore generally taxed as commercial profits.”\n\nIt appears that Luxembourg evaluates newly mined cryptocurrency for tax purposes at the time\nwhen it is received.’\n\n1 Circulaire du directeur des contributions, L.I.R.

Introduction  \nWhile crypto currencies are still largely unregulated in Luxembourg, the government issued  instructions on the tax treatment of crypto currencies on July 26, 2018.  This circular establishes  that Luxembourg does not consider crypto currencies to be an actual currency. Rather,  crypto currencies are considered to be an intangible asset for tax purposes.   \nII.  Taxation of Non-professional Traders  \nBuying and selling cryptocurrency is considered to be “speculation” as defined by Article 99bis  of the Income Tax Law.  As such, profit from such an operation is only taxable if the sale of  cryptocurrency occurred six months or less after the purchase, and the taxpayer earned more than  500 euros (approximately US\\$612) in total profits from speculation during the civil year.  If there  is more than six months between the purchase and sale of an amount of cryptocurrency, profit  from that operation is not taxed.  \nIII.  Taxation of Professional Traders and Miners  \nA person’s cryptocurrency trading activity is considered a commercial activity under the Income  Tax Law if it is a “for-profit independent activity exercised on a permanent basis and participating  in general economic life.” 5  The 2018 circular states that “these conditions are regularly fulfilled”  in cases involving cryptocurrency mining or online cryptocurrency exchange markets.  Income  derived from these activities is therefore generally taxed as commercial profits.    \nIt appears that Luxembourg evaluates newly mined cryptocurrency for tax purposes at the time  when it is received.

In addition, if cryptoassets are held as trading  stock, a person’s expenses also include the opening value of the trading stock. The guidance also  provides information on methods for determining the cost of cryptoassets that are not trading  stock, and on calculating the cost of cryptoassets received by a miner or as payment.   \nB.  Individual Income Tax Rules  \nThe income tax rules are generally applicable to the amounts that an individual gets from “selling,  trading or exchanging cryptoassets,” with a person needing to pay tax (or able to claim losses) if  he or she is   \n•   acquiring cryptoassets for the purpose of disposal (for example to sell or exchange)  •   trading in cryptoassets  •   using cryptoassets for a profit-making scheme.      \nDisposal includes selling or exchanging cryptoassets, using cryptoassets to pay for goods or  services, and giving away cryptoassets to another person. IR considers a person’s purpose (or  purposes) for acquiring cryptoassets at the time they are acquired.  This means that whatever  the individual says is the purpose must be supported by what he or she actually does and the  surrounding circumstances, including the  \n•   nature of the asset (for example, does it provide an income stream or any other benefits  while being held)  •   circumstances of the purchase  •   number of similar transactions  •   length of time you hold the asset  •   circumstances of the use and disposal of the asset.

Airdropped cryptoassets may be taxable on receipt where they are received by:  \n•   some cryptoasset businesses (if received as an ordinary incident of the way in  which the business earns its income);  •   a person who has an undertaking or scheme to profit from the receipt of  airdropped cryptoassets;  •   a person who has provided services and receives airdropped cryptoassets as  payment for those services; or  •   a person who receives airdrops on a regular basis, such that they have the  hallmarks of income.  \nAs with the previous issue [of cryptoassets received from a hard fork], if airdropped  cryptoassets are taxable on receipt, valuation and timing issues may arise.   \nThe initial conclusions regarding the tax treatment of airdropped cryptoassets upon their disposal  are as follows:  \nThe tax consequences of disposing of new cryptoassets received from an airdrop depend  on the recipient’s individual circumstances.  \nGenerally, the disposal of an airdropped cryptoasset by a cryptoasset business will be  the disposal of trading stock in the ordinary course of that business, or will be income  "}

Tax Treatment of Mined and Staked Crypto currencies  \nThe Norwegian Tax Authority (Skatteetaten) has issued guidance for the tax treatment of mining  of crypto currencies.

However, when mining is carried out on a large scale it may be considered a  “commercial activity” and the taxpayer to be self-employed.  Hobbies are not taxed, while  commercial activity is.  Whether mining constitutes a commercial activity will depend on its  scope and duration.  According to the Tax Authority, staked crypto currencies are treated as  mined crypto currencies for purposes of income taxation.  Holders must report their proof of  work and proof of stake protocols on their tax returns.   "}

It appears the Swedish Tax  Authority has not made any other statements related to staked crypto currencies. Service  providers that advertise tax services in relation to crypto currencies appear to treat staked  currencies similarly to mining for tax purposes.  However, another interpretation by one tax  service provider describes the tax treatment of staking rewards as follows: “Staking is in the  world of crypto the same as lending your cryptoasset and according to the Swedish Tax Authority  these shall be taxed as sales during the loan and as purchases when you yourself borrow or  receive back the previous lent crypto.” 19  This interpretation would result in a different tax  situation than if treated as mined crypto currencies. If considered mined crypto currencies the  staked cryptocurrency would be taxable as income (either personal income or commercial activity  depending on the scale) at the time of receipt, whereas if similar to a purchase, the receipt would  not be taxable.     \nB.   Tax Treatment of Tokens Received Through “Airdrops” and “Hard Forks”  \nThe Swedish Tax Authority has not issued guidelines that specifically address airdrops or hard  forks. The tax status of assets obtained by these means will depend on what form of income they  are considered similar to. If the airdrop or hard fork, by its nature, is similar to mining, the receipt  via airdrop or hard fork would be considered income from a hobby (or commercial activity if  done on a larger scale) and subject to the corresponding tax.  If they are instead considered gifts  the cryptocurrency will be not be taxed at acquisition, as gifts are not subject to tax in Sweden.    \nSwedish tax service providers specializing in taxes related to cryptocurrency appear to take  differing views of these kinds of assets.
