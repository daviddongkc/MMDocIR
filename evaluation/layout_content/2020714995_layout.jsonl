In the UK, a body established to consider the ethics of the app noted that it would be  possible to require the app for individuals returning to work or using public transportation. In  Argentina, installing the contact tracing app is generally voluntary; however, people who enter  the country from abroad and people who return to work are obligated to install it. India’s contact  tracing app’s use was considered voluntary when launched in early April but became mandatory  for public- and private-sector employees in early May. This requirement was eased in late May  after criticism from privacy and digital rights organizations. In China, even though the health  code apps that assign different color codes to people depending on their infection status appear  not to have been made compulsory, they are de facto compulsory in many cities as citizens  without the code are not able to enter most public places. In Turkey, travelers whose HES codes  on their app indicate that they were diagnosed as positive or have been in contact with a person  diagnosed as such are not allowed to use public transportation or airplanes. In Russia, all people  identified as having been in contact with an infected individual must install the “Social  Monitoring app” or face a fine.

The  European Data Protection Board has voiced concerns with regard to apps that use location  tracking as they violate the principle of data minimization. In Australia, critics voiced concerns  that United States law enforcement entities could gain access to the app data, because the data is  being hosted in Australia by Amazon Web Services, a US company subject to the Clarifying  Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act).
