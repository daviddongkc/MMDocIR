As\ndescribed above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in\nthe markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and\nsolutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that\nanticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our\nclients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually\nevolving, as well as developments in areas such as artificial intelligence, augmented reality, automation, blockchain, Internet\nof Things, quantum and edge computing and as-a-service solutions. Technological developments may materially affect the\ncost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of as-a-service solutions, could affect the nature of how we\ngenerate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services\nand solutions and may continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay\nspending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new\ntechnologies.

We must hire or reskill, retain and motivate appropriate numbers of talented people with diverse skills in\norder to serve clients across the globe, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in technology, industry and the\nmacroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. For example, if we are unable to hire or\nretrain our employees to keep pace with the rapid and continuous changes in technology and the industries we serve, we\nmay not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand. There is intense competition for\nscarce talent with market-leading skills and capabilities in new technologies, and our competitors have directly targeted our\nemployees with these highly sought-after skills and will likely continue to do so. As a result, we may be unable to cost-\neffectively hire and retain employees with these market-leading skills, which may cause us to incur increased costs, or be\nunable to fulfill client demand for our services and solutions.\n\nWe are particularly dependent on retaining members of Accenture Leadership with critical capabilities.

If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or  completing engagements to a client’s satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be  unprofitable. Moreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of  agreed-upon performance standards or milestones.

Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or  our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or  be unprofitable. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our  services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors  and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances.

Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or  may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and  complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties  whom we do not control.

The\nincreasingly complex global tax environment, and any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties, could have a material\nadverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action\ncould be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.\nOur inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition,\ncongressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also\nsubject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy\n(or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with\nIreland or the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or\nthese other jurisdictions.\n\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the\nmarketplace.\n\nWe believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services\nand solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However,\nour corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, competitors,\ncybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government\ninvestigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, advocacy groups,\nregulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer, or the clients that we\nserve. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees,\ncompetitors, vendors, alliance partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government\nregulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers. There is a risk\nthat negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect\nour business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or\nexisting clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our\nrecruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture\nbrand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\n\nAs a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to\nexpand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.\n\nWe have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 50 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy\nis to continue to expand in our key markets around the world. Our growth strategy might not be successful. If we are unable\nto manage the risks of our global operations and growth strategy, including pandemics, international hostilities, terrorist\nactivities, natural disasters and security or data incidents, the concentration of our global delivery capability in India and the\nPhilippines, failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems,\nour results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally\ninvolve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets.

There is significant uncertainty regarding such proposals. The  increasingly complex global tax environment, and any unfavorable resolution of these uncertainties, could have a material  adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. \nAlthough we expect to be able to rely on the tax treaty between the United States and Ireland, legislative or diplomatic action  could be taken, or the treaty may be amended in such a way, that would prevent us from being able to rely on such treaty.  Our inability to rely on the treaty would subject us to increased taxation or significant additional expense. In addition,  congressional proposals could change the definition of a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could also  subject us to increased taxation. In addition, we could be materially adversely affected by future changes in tax law or policy  (or in their interpretation or enforcement) in Ireland or other jurisdictions where we operate, including their treaties with  Ireland or the United States. These changes could be exacerbated by economic, budget or other challenges facing Ireland or  these other jurisdictions.  \nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the  marketplace. \nWe believe the Accenture brand name and our reputation are important corporate assets that help distinguish our services  and solutions from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However,  our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, competitors,  cybersecurity incidents or service outages, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures, compliance violations, government  investigations or legal proceedings. We may also experience reputational damage from employees, advocacy groups,  regulators, investors and other stakeholders that disagree with the services and solutions that we offer, or the clients that we  serve. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, directors, employees,  competitors, vendors, alliance partners, joint venture partners, adversaries in legal proceedings, legislators or government  regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media, including social media influencers. There is a risk  that negative or inaccurate information about Accenture, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect  our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or  existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our  recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the Accenture  brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price. \nAs a result of our geographically diverse operations and our growth strategy to continue to  expand in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks. \nWe have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 50 countries around the world. One aspect of our growth strategy  is to continue to expand in our key markets around the world. Our growth strategy might not be successful. If we are unable  to manage the risks of our global operations and growth strategy, including pandemics, international hostilities, terrorist  activities, natural disasters and security or data incidents, the concentration of our global delivery capability in India and the  Philippines, failure to maintain compliance with our clients’ control requirements and multiple legal and regulatory systems,  our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected. In addition, emerging markets generally  involve greater financial and operational risks, such as those described below, than our more mature markets. Negative or  uncertain political climates in countries or geographies where we operate could also adversely affect us. \nPandemics, international hostilities, terrorist activities, natural disasters, and infrastructure disruptions could  prevent us from effectively serving our clients and thus significantly adversely affect our results of operations.

The inherent limitations of  internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities. \n\n • U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if  certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud,  overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or  debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact  contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil,  criminal or administrative sanctions.  Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with  commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more  extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its  accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.  Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.  For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment  terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.  Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and  executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these  projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments,  including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could  result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of  incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient  funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our  investments.  Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among  key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues  can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed,  decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in  areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules  or laws is assessed.  Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company. We elected to enter into  a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government  contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government. The proxy agreement regulates the management  and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary. In addition, legislative and executive  proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional  limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or  could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state  legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain  U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S.  company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative  proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.

Any infringement action brought against us or our clients could be costly to defend or lead to an expensive  settlement or judgment against us.  \nFurther, we rely on third-party software in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue  using any such software for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain  substitute software or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and  solutions. Our inability to replace such software, or to replace such software in a timely or cost-effective manner, could  materially adversely affect our results of operations. \nOur results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to  maintain effective internal controls.  \nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide  a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of  the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the  possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of  these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we  cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved  controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial  statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our  public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or  be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new  business could be materially adversely affected. \nChanges to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection  with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our  financial results.  \nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible  that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.  The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain  items and future events that affect our reported financial condition, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among  other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in Management’s  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”  We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to  be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of  judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the  assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may  need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.  \nWe might be unable to access additional capital on favorable terms or at all. If we raise equity  capital, it may dilute our shareholders’ ownership interest in us.  \nWe might choose to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to:  "}

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 29\n\nFor further information on the impact to our results for fiscal 2020, please see “Summary of Results” below. For a discussion\nof risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Our results of operations have been significantly adversely affected and\ncould in the future be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” under Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n\nSummary of Results\n\nRevenues for fiscal 2020 increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 4% in local currency compared to fiscal 2019. This included the\nimpact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced revenues approximately 1%. During fiscal 2020, revenue\ngrowth in local currency was strong in Growth Markets, solid in North America and flat in Europe. We experienced local\ncurrency revenue growth that was very strong in Health & Public Service, modest in Products, Communications, Media &\nTechnology and Financial Services and flat in Resources. Revenue growth in local currency was strong in outsourcing and\nmodest in consulting during fiscal 2020. The business environment remained competitive, and the changes in demand have\nled to increased pricing pressure, particularly for our consulting services. We use the term “pricing” to mean the contract\nprofitability or margin on the work that we sell.\n\nIn our consulting business, revenues for fiscal 2020 were flat in U.S. dollars and increased 2% in local currency compared to\nfiscal 2019. This included the impact of a decline in reimbursable travel costs, which reduced consulting revenues\napproximately 2%. Consulting revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth in Growth Markets\nand modest growth in North America, partially offset by a modest decline in Europe. Our consulting revenue continues to be\ndriven by digital-, cloud- and security-related services and assisting clients with the adoption of new technologies. In addition,\nclients continue to be focused on initiatives designed to deliver cost savings and operational efficiency, as well as projects to\nintegrate their global operations and grow and transform their businesses.\n\nIn our outsourcing business, revenues for fiscal 2020 increased 6% in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency compared to\nfiscal 2019. Outsourcing revenue growth in local currency in fiscal 2020 was led by strong growth across all geographic\nmarkets. We continue to experience growing demand to assist clients with the operation and maintenance of digital-related\nservices and cloud enablement. In addition, clients continue to be focused on transforming their operations to improve\neffectiveness and cost efficiency.\n\nAs we are a global company, our revenues are denominated in multiple currencies and may be significantly affected by\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. The majority of our revenues are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar,\nincluding the Euro, Japanese yen, and U.K. pound. There continues to be volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.\nUnfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had and could have in the future a material effect on our\nfinancial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies, resulting in favorable currency translation, our revenues,\nrevenue growth and results of operations in U.S. dollars may be higher. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against other\ncurrencies, resulting in unfavorable currency translation, our revenues, revenue growth and results of operations in U.S.\ndollars may be lower. The U.S. dollar strengthened against various currencies during fiscal 2020, resulting in unfavorable\ncurrency translation and U.S. dollar revenue growth that was approximately 1% lower than our revenue growth in local\ncurrency for the year. Assuming that exchange rates stay within recent ranges, we estimate that our fiscal 2021 revenue\ngrowth in U.S. dollars will be approximately 2% higher than our revenue growth in local currency.\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative\ncosts. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of client-service personnel, which consists mainly of compensation,\nsubcontractor and other personnel costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety\nof activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales\nand marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and\nadvertising-related activities; and certain acquisition-related costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs\nfor non-client-facing personnel, information systems, office space and certain acquisition-related costs.\n\nUtilization for fiscal 2020 was 90%, down from 91% in fiscal 2019. We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We\nproactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in\nthe anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our\noperating expenses. Our headcount, the majority of which serve our clients, increased to approximately 506,000 as of\nAugust 31, 2020, compared to approximately 492,000 as of August 31, 2019. The year-over-year increase in our headcount\nreflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as headcount added in connection with\nacquisitions. Attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, for fiscal 2020 was 12%, down from 17% in fiscal 2019. We\nevaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills\nand resources in balance with changes in client demand. In addition, we adjust compensation in certain skill sets and\ngeographies in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our personnel,\ncompensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. We strive to adjust pricing and/or the mix of\nresources to reduce the impact of compensation increases on our margin. Our ability to grow our revenues and maintain or\nincrease our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with\nchanges in the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover increases in compensation; deploy\nour employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate and utilize new employees.\n\n", "vlm_text": "For further information on the impact to our results for fiscal 2020, please see “Summary of Results” below.

The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2020 was due to lower non-payroll costs, primarily for travel,\npartially offset by an increase in labor costs as a percentage of revenues compared to fiscal 2019.\n\nSales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2020,\ncompared with 16.2% for fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, Sales and marketing costs as a percentage of\nrevenues increased 10 basis points and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis\npoints, primarily due to higher technology and facilities costs.\n\nOperating margin (Operating income as a percentage of revenues) for fiscal 2020 was 14.7%, compared with 14.6% for\nfiscal 2019.\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, we recorded gains of $332 million and $52 million in tax expense related to our investment in Duck Creek\nTechnologies.

Where practical, we seek to manage\nforeign currency exposure for costs not incurred in the same currency as the related revenues, such as the costs associated\nwith our global delivery model, by using currency protection provisions in our customer contracts and through our hedging\nprograms. For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial\nStatements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nBookings\n\nNew bookings for fiscal 2020 were $49.6 billion, with consulting bookings of $25.8 billion and outsourcing bookings of $23.7\nbillion, compared to $45.5 billion in fiscal 2019, with consulting bookings of $24.7 billion and outsourcing bookings of $20.8\nbillion.\n\nWe provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through\nacquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides\nuseful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly\nquarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types\nof services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new\nbookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to\nrevenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings.\n\nInformation regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues\nover time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the\ncalculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to\nbookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange\nrates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nThe majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some\nwithout notice.

For more information on our hedging programs, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial  Statements under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” \nBookings \nNew bookings for fiscal 2020 were  $\\S49.6$   billion, with consulting bookings of  $\\S25.8$   billion and outsourcing bookings of   $\\S23.7$  billion, compared to  $\\S45.5$   billion in fiscal 2019, with consulting bookings of  $\\S24.7$   billion and outsourcing bookings of   $\\S20.8$    billion.  \nWe provide information regarding our new bookings, which include new contracts, including those acquired through  acquisitions, as well as renewals, extensions and changes to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides  useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly  quarter to quarter depending in part on the timing of the signing of a small number of large outsourcing contracts. The types  of services and solutions clients are demanding and the pace and level of their spending may impact the conversion of new  bookings to revenues. For example, outsourcing bookings, which are typically for multi-year contracts, generally convert to  revenue over a longer period of time compared to consulting bookings. \nInformation regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues  over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the  calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to  bookings originally recorded in prior fiscal years. New bookings are recorded using then-existing foreign currency exchange  rates and are not subsequently adjusted for foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.  \nThe majority of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice with little or no termination penalties, and some  without notice. Only the non-cancelable portion of these contracts is included in the performance obligations disclosed in  Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  Accordingly, a significant portion of what we consider contract bookings is not included in our remaining performance  obligations.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 31\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\nrequires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of\ncontingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues\nand expenses. We continually evaluate our estimates, judgments and assumptions based on available information and\nexperience. Because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those\nestimates. Certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application. These\ninclude certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and income taxes.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nDetermining the method and amount of revenue to recognize requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically,\ncomplex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the\nappropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct\nperformance obligations and should be accounted for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance\nobligations are satisfied over-time or at a point-in-time and the selection of the method to measure progress towards\ncompletion.\n\nWe measure progress towards completion for technology integration consulting services using costs incurred to date relative\nto total estimated costs at completion. Revenues, including estimated fees, are recorded proportionally as costs are\nincurred. The amount of revenue recognized for these contracts in a period is dependent on our ability to estimate total\ncontract costs. We continually evaluate our estimates of total contract costs based on available information and experience.\n\nAdditionally, the nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many\ncontracts include incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may\nincrease the variability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. We conduct reviews prior to signing such\ncontracts to evaluate whether these incentives are reasonably achievable. Our estimates are monitored over the lives of our\ncontracts and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience and other information\navailable at the time.\n\nFor additional information, see Note 2 (Revenues) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed U.S. tax law.\nThe Tax Act lowered the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, resulting ina\nblended U.S. statutory federal income tax rate of 25.7% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2018 and a U.S. statutory\nfederal income tax rate of 21.0% for our fiscal year ended August 31, 2019. The Tax Act’s “base erosion and anti-abuse tax”\nprovision, and regulations issued thereunder, adversely impact our effective tax rate by limiting our ability to deduct certain\nexpenses.\n\nDetermining the consolidated provision for income tax expense, income tax liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities\ninvolves judgment. Deferred tax assets and liabilities, measured using enacted tax rates, are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial statement bases of assets and liabilities. As a global\ncompany, we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves\nestimating current tax exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax\nassets. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. In assessing the\nrealizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax\nassets will not be realized and adjust the valuation allowances accordingly. Factors considered in making this determination\ninclude the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, tax planning strategies and historical and\nprojected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction in which the tax asset is located. Valuation\nallowances will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors.\nChanges in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate.\n\nWe apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to our quarterly operating results to determine the interim provision for\nincome tax expense. A change in judgment that impacts the measurement of a tax position taken in a prior year is\nrecognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs. In the event there is a significant unusual or\ninfrequent item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is recorded in the interim period\nin which it occurs. We release stranded tax effects from Accumulated other comprehensive loss using the specific\nidentification approach for our defined benefit plans and the portfolio approach for other items.\n\n", "vlm_text": "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  \nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of  contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues  and expenses.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 38\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative\nDisclosures About Market Risk\n\nAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.\n\nForeign Currency Risk\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when\nfeasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit\nrisk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as\ncounterparties.\n\nCertain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and\ntypically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S.\ndollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso\nand U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in\nthe fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements.\nAdditionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our\nglobal delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/\nIndian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding\nthree years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global\ndelivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements\nunder Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\n\nFor designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are\nexpected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of\nservices. As of August 31, 2020, it was anticipated that approximately $62 million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded\nin Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.\n\nWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the\nfair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash\nflows as affected by changes in exchange rates. This sensitivity analysis represents the hypothetical changes in value of the\nhedge position and does not reflect the offsetting gain or loss on the underlying exposure. A 10% change in the levels of\nforeign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with\nall other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately\n$592 million and $509 million as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2020 is not material in relation to\nour consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While we may do so in the future, we have not used\nderivative financial instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of our investment holdings or debt instruments.\n\nEquity Investment Risk\n\nOur non-marketable and marketable equity securities are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks that could\nsubstantially reduce or increase the fair value of our investments.\n\nOur non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies which are often in a start-up or\ndevelopment stage, which is inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are\ntypically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our investment in\nthese companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies,\nwhich is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these\nevaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on\nour long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were not material in relation to our consolidated\nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows as of August 31, 2020.\n\n", "vlm_text": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative  Disclosures About Market Risk  \nAll of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading.  \nForeign Currency Risk  \nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk in the ordinary course of business. We hedge material cash flow exposures when  feasible using forward contracts. These instruments are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and credit  risk. Credit risk is managed through careful selection and ongoing evaluation of the financial institutions utilized as  counterparties.  \nCertain of these hedge positions are undesignated hedges of balance sheet exposures such as intercompany loans and  typically have maturities of less than one year. These hedges—primarily U.S. dollar/Euro, U.S. dollar/Japanese yen, U.S.  dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Swiss franc, U.S. dollar/Australian dollar, U.S. dollar/U.K. pound, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso  and U.S. dollar/Singapore dollar—are intended to offset remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities. Changes in  the fair value of these derivatives are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income Statements.  Additionally, we have hedge positions that are designated cash flow hedges of certain intercompany charges relating to our  global delivery model. These hedges—U.S. dollar/Indian rupee, U.S. dollar/Philippine peso, U.K. pound/Indian rupee, Euro/ Indian rupee, Australian dollar/Indian rupee and Japanese yen/Chinese yuan, which typically have maturities not exceeding  three years—are intended to partially offset the impact of foreign currency movements on future costs relating to our global  delivery resources. For additional information, see Note 9 (Financial Instruments) to our Consolidated Financial Statements  under Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”  \nFor designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses currently recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss are  expected to be reclassified into earnings at the time when certain anticipated intercompany charges are accrued as Cost of  services. As of August 31, 2020, it was anticipated that approximately  $\\S62$   million of net gains, net of tax, currently recorded  in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Cost of services within the next 12 months.   \nWe use sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have on the  fair value of our hedge portfolio. The sensitivity of the hedge portfolio is computed based on the market value of future cash  flows as affected by changes in exchange rates.

A  $10\\%$   change in the levels of  foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar (or other base currency of the hedge if not a U.S. dollar hedge) with  all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our hedge instruments of approximately   $\\S592$   million and   $\\S509$   million as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nInterest Rate Risk  \nThe interest rate risk associated with our borrowing and investing activities as of August 31, 2020 is not material in relation to  our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts\nor disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,\nsubjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEstimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from contracts for technology\nintegration consulting services where the Company designs, builds, and implements new or enhanced system\napplications and related processes for its clients are recognized over time since control of the system is transferred\ncontinuously to the client. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs\nat completion to measure progress toward satisfying the Company’s performance obligations, which typically occurs\nover time periods ranging from six months to two years.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts\nas a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the estimate of costs to complete the\ncontracts.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design\nand tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's process for estimating costs to\ncomplete technology integration consulting services contracts, including controls over the estimate of costs to complete\nthe contracts. We tested the estimated costs to complete for certain technology integration consulting services contracts\nby evaluating:\n\n+ the scope of the work and timing of delivery for consistency with the underlying contractual terms;\n\n+ the estimated costs to complete in relation to progress toward satisfying the Company's performance obligations,\nbased on internal and customer-facing information;\n\n* changes to estimated costs, if any, including the amount and timing of the change based on internal information or\ncontractual changes; and\n\n* actual costs incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date to assess if they were consistent with the estimate for\nthat time period.\n\nWe evaluated the Company's ability to estimate costs by comparing estimates developed at contract inception to actual\ncosts ultimately incurred to satisfy the performance obligation.\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has $1,239 million of unrecognized tax\nbenefits as of August 31, 2020. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company\nrecognizes tax positions when it believes such positions are more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.\nRecognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.\nThe Company uses estimates and assumptions in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing and certain other\nintercompany transactions as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the\nCompany’s interpretation of tax law and its analysis of the recognition and measurement of its tax positions.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

Also,  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial  statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts  or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,  subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the  consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below,  providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nEstimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts \nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues from contracts for technology  integration consulting services where the Company designs, builds, and implements new or enhanced system  applications and related processes for its clients are recognized over time since control of the system is transferred  continuously to the client. Generally, revenue is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs  at completion to measure progress toward satisfying the Company’s performance obligations, which typically occurs  over time periods ranging from six months to two years.   \nWe identified the evaluation of estimated costs to complete certain technology integration consulting services contracts  as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the estimate of costs to complete the  contracts.   \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design  and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s process for estimating costs to  complete technology integration consulting services contracts, including controls over the estimate of costs to complete  the contracts. We tested the estimated costs to complete for certain technology integration consulting services contracts  by evaluating: \n\n• the estimated costs to complete in relation to progress toward satisfying the Company's performance obligations,  based on internal and customer-facing information; • changes to estimated costs, if any, including the amount and timing of the change based on internal information or  contractual changes; and • actual costs incurred subsequent to the balance sheet date to assess if they were consistent with the estimate for  that time period.   \nWe evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate costs by comparing estimates developed at contract inception to actual  costs ultimately incurred to satisfy the performance obligation. \nUnrecognized tax benefits \nAs discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has   $^{\\S1,239}$   million of unrecognized tax  benefits as of August 31, 2020. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company  recognizes tax positions when it believes such positions are more likely than not of being sustained if challenged.  Recognized tax positions are measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.  The Company uses estimates and assumptions in determining the amount of unrecognized tax benefits.  \nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits related to transfer pricing and certain other  intercompany transactions as a critical audit matter. Complex auditor judgment was required in evaluating the  Company’s interpretation of tax law and its analysis of the recognition and measurement of its tax positions. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nDescription of Business\n\nAccenture plc is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services in strategy and\nconsulting, interactive, technology and operations. We serve clients in three geographic markets: North America, Europe and\nGrowth Markets (Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East). Our geographic markets bring together capabilities\nfrom across the organization, with digital skills and industry and functional expertise throughout, to deliver tangible value to\nour clients.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and our controlled\nsubsidiary companies. Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company, which operates its business through its subsidiaries.\nPrior to March 13, 2018, Accenture plc’s only business was to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the\ncontrolling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. We operated our business\nthrough Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture plc controlled Accenture Holdings plc’s\nmanagement and operations and consolidated Accenture Holdings plc’s results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nOn March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As\naresult, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc\nceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities\nthat held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership\nand their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings\nplc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.\n\nThe shares of Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other\nthan us are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interest\npercentage was less than 1% as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nAll references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference\nto “fiscal 2020” means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2020. All references to quarters, unless otherwise\nnoted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial\nStatements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of\ncurrent events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.\n\nEffective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic\nmarkets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal\n2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology,\nFinancial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. See Note 7 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note\n16 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the change in our reportable\nsegments.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe account for revenue in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\nwhich we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.\n", "vlm_text": "1.

Our geographic markets bring together capabilities  from across the organization, with digital skills and industry and functional expertise throughout, to deliver tangible value to  our clients.  \nBasis of Presentation  \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Accenture plc, an Irish company, and our controlled  subsidiary companies. Accenture plc is an Irish public limited company, which operates its business through its subsidiaries.  Prior to March 13, 2018, Accenture plc’s only business was to hold ordinary and deferred shares in, and to act as the  controlling shareholder of, its subsidiary, Accenture Holdings plc, an Irish public limited company. We operated our business  through Accenture Holdings plc and subsidiaries of Accenture Holdings plc. Accenture plc controlled Accenture Holdings plc’s  management and operations and consolidated Accenture Holdings plc’s results in our Consolidated Financial Statements.   \nOn March 13, 2018, Accenture Holdings plc merged with and into Accenture plc, with Accenture plc as the surviving entity. As  a result, all of the assets and liabilities of Accenture Holdings plc were acquired by Accenture plc, and Accenture Holdings plc  ceased to exist. In connection with this internal merger, shareholders of Accenture Holdings plc (other than Accenture entities  that held shares of Accenture Holdings plc), who primarily consisted of current and former members of Accenture Leadership  and their permitted transferees, received one Class A ordinary share of Accenture plc for each share of Accenture Holdings  plc that they owned, and Accenture plc redeemed all Class X ordinary shares of Accenture plc owned by such shareholders.  \nThe shares of Accenture Holdings plc (for applicable periods) and Accenture Canada Holdings Inc. held by persons other  than us are treated as a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The noncontrolling interest  percentage was less than  $1\\%$   as of August 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nAll references to years, unless otherwise noted, refer to our fiscal year, which ends on August 31. For example, a reference  to “fiscal   $_{2020^{\\circ}}$   means the 12-month period that ended on August 31, 2020. All references to quarters, unless otherwise  noted, refer to the quarters of our fiscal year.  \nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial  Statements and accompanying disclosures. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of  current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results may be different from those estimates.  \nEffective March 1, 2020, we began managing our business under a new growth model through our three geographic  markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, which became our reportable segments in the third quarter of fiscal  2020. Prior to this change, our reportable segments were our five industry groups, Communications, Media & Technology,  Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products and Resources. See Note 7 (Goodwill and Intangible Assets) and Note  16 (Segment Reporting) to these Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the change in our reportable  segments. \nRevenue Recognition  \nWe account for revenue in accordance with FASB ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which we adopted on September 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method.

A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as\nrevenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate\nthe contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The primary\nmethod used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus a margin approach, under which we forecast our\nexpected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service\nbased on margins for similar services sold on a standalone basis. While determining relative standalone selling price and\nidentifying separate performance obligations require judgment, generally relative standalone selling prices and the separate\nperformance obligations are readily identifiable as we sell those performance obligations unaccompanied by other\nperformance obligations. Contract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified\nto account for changes in the contract specifications, requirements or duration. If a contract modification results in the\naddition of performance obligations priced at a standalone selling price or if the post-modification services are distinct from\nthe services provided prior to the modification, the modification is accounted for separately. If the modified services are not\ndistinct, they are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\n\nOur revenues are derived from contracts for outsourcing services, technology integration consulting services and non-\ntechnology integration consulting services. These contracts have different terms based on the scope, performance\nobligations and complexity of the engagement, which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates in recognizing\nrevenues. We have many types of contracts, including time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, fee-per-transaction\ncontracts and contracts with multiple fee types.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including incentive fees. Many contracts\ninclude incentives or penalties related to costs incurred, benefits produced or adherence to schedules that may increase the\nvariability in revenues and margins earned on such contracts. These variable amounts generally are awarded or refunded\nupon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metrics, milestones or cost targets and can be based upon\nclient discretion. We include these variable fees in the estimated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably\nestimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable a significant reversal of revenue will occur. These estimates reflect the\nexpected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance, historical experience\nand other information available at the time.\n\nOur performance obligations are satisfied over time as work progresses or at a point in time. The majority of our revenues\nare recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligations. The selection of\nthe method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the\nservices to be provided.\n\nOutsourcing Contracts\n\nOur outsourcing contracts typically span several years. Revenues are generally recognized on outsourcing contracts over\ntime because our clients benefit from the services as they are performed. Outsourcing contracts require us to provide a\nseries of distinct services each period over the contract term. Revenues from unit-priced contracts are recognized as\ntransactions are processed. When contractual billings represent an amount that corresponds directly with the value provided\nto the client (e.g., time-and-materials contracts), revenues are recognized as amounts become billable in accordance with\ncontract terms.\n\nTechnology Integration Consulting Services\n\nRevenues from contracts for technology integration consulting services where we design/redesign, build and implement new\nor enhanced systems and related processes for our clients are recognized over time as control of the system is transferred\ncontinuously to the client. Contracts for technology integration consulting services generally span six months to two years.\nGenerally, revenue, including estimated fees, is recognized using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at\ncompletion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations.

Prior period amounts were not adjusted. The primary impact of adoption is the requirement for lessees to  recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by both operating and finance  leases. Enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures about leasing arrangements are also required. We elected the  package of practical expedients which does not require reassessment of prior conclusions related to identifying leases, lease  classification or initial direct costs. We also elected the practical expedient to combine lease and non-lease components,  accounting for the combined components as a single lease component, for our office real estate and automobile leases. The  standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Income Statement. "}

Financial Instruments\n\nDerivatives\n\nIn the normal course of business, we use derivative financial instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nDerivative transactions are governed by a uniform set of policies and procedures covering areas such as authorization,\ncounterparty exposure and hedging practices. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivity\nanalyses. We do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes. We classify cash flows from our derivative\nprograms as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.\n\nCertain derivatives give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally\nlimited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to us, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based\non the gross fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in an asset position, was $154,749 as of August 31,\n2020.\n\nWe utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency\ntransaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the\ntransaction. These provisions may reduce our potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and\nreduce a counterparty’s potential overall loss resulting from our insolvency. Additionally, these agreements contain early\ntermination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty’s credit rating, thereby enabling us to accelerate\nsettlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease our realized loss on an open transaction.\nSimilarly, a decrement in our credit rating could trigger a counterparty’s early termination rights, thereby enabling a\ncounterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase our realized\nloss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features\nthat were in a liability position as of August 31, 2020 was $39,018.\n\nOur derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values\nfor derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as\nLevel 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party\nvaluation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates\nand yield curves. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 12\n(Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCash Flow Hedges\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of our global delivery resources. To mitigate this\nrisk, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses\ndenominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. We have designated these derivatives as cash flow\nhedges. As of August 31, 2020 and 2019, we held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment\nhedges.\n\nIn order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow\nor net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation\nincludes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, our risk management objective and\nstrategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring\nhedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in\neither the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis.\n\nFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of\nservices in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The\namounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were net gains of\n$48,545, $48,333 and $93,105 during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The ineffective portion of the change in fair\nvalue of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income\nStatements and for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, was not material. In addition, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges\nduring fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n", "vlm_text": "9.

We classify cash flows from our derivative  programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Cash Flows Statements.  \nCertain derivatives give rise to credit risks from the possible non-performance by counterparties. Credit risk is generally  limited to the fair value of those contracts that are favorable to us, and the maximum amount of loss due to credit risk, based  on the gross fair value of our derivative financial instruments that are in an asset position, was  $\\S154{,}749$   as of August 31,  2020.  \nWe utilize standard counterparty master agreements containing provisions for the netting of certain foreign currency  transaction obligations and for set-off of certain obligations in the event of an insolvency of one of the parties to the  transaction. These provisions may reduce our potential overall loss resulting from the insolvency of a counterparty and  reduce a counterparty’s potential overall loss resulting from our insolvency. Additionally, these agreements contain early  termination provisions triggered by adverse changes in a counterparty’s credit rating, thereby enabling us to accelerate  settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially decrease our realized loss on an open transaction.  Similarly, a decrement in our credit rating could trigger a counterparty’s early termination rights, thereby enabling a  counterparty to accelerate settlement of a transaction prior to its contractual maturity and potentially increase our realized  loss on an open transaction. The aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features  that were in a liability position as of August 31, 2020 was  $\\S39{,}018$  .  \nOur derivative financial instruments consist of deliverable and non-deliverable foreign currency forward contracts. Fair values  for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models and are classified as  Level 2 in accordance with the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements. All of the significant inputs to the third-party  valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates  and yield curves. For additional information related to the three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements, see Note 12  (Retirement and Profit Sharing Plans) to these Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nCash Flow Hedges  \nCertain of our subsidiaries are exposed to currency risk through their use of our global delivery resources. To mitigate this  risk, we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted intercompany expenses  denominated in foreign currencies for up to three years in the future. We have designated these derivatives as cash flow  hedges. As of August 31, 2020 and 2019, we held no derivatives that were designated as fair value or net investment  hedges.  \nIn order for a derivative to qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative must be formally designated as a fair value, cash flow  or net investment hedge by documenting the relationship between the derivative and the hedged item. The documentation  includes a description of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the risk being hedged, our risk management objective and  strategy for undertaking the hedge, the method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedge and the method for measuring  hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, the hedge relationship must be expected to be highly effective at offsetting changes in  either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item at both inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis. \nFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in estimated fair value of a hedging instrument is recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of Shareholders’ Equity and is reclassified into Cost of  services in the Consolidated Income Statements during the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized. The  amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges that were reclassified into Cost of services were net gains of   $^{\\S48,545}$  ,  $\\S48{,}333$   and   $\\S93$  ,105 during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The ineffective portion of the change in fair  value of a cash flow hedge is recognized immediately in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Income  Statements and for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, was not material. In addition, we did not discontinue any cash flow hedges  during fiscal 2020, 2019 or 2018. "}

Indemnification provisions are also included in arrangements under which we agree to hold\nthe indemnified party harmless with respect to third-party claims related to such matters as title to assets sold or licensed or\ncertain intellectual property rights.\n\nTypically, we have contractual recourse against third parties for certain payments we made in connection with arrangements\nwhere third-party nonperformance has given rise to the client's claim. Payments we made under any of the arrangements\ndescribed above are generally conditioned on the client making a claim, which may be disputed by us typically under dispute\nresolution procedures specified in the particular arrangement. The limitations of liability under these arrangements may be\nexpressly limited or may not be expressly specified in terms of time and/or amount.\n\nAs of August 31, 2020 and 2019, our aggregate potential liability to our clients for expressly limited guarantees involving the\nperformance of third parties was approximately $832,000 and $794,000, respectively, of which all but approximately $87,000\nand $128,000, respectively, may be recovered from the other third parties if we are obligated to make payments to the\nindemnified parties as a consequence of a performance default by the other third parties. For arrangements with unspecified\nlimitations, we cannot reasonably estimate the aggregate maximum potential liability, as it is inherently difficult to predict the\nmaximum potential amount of such payments, due to the conditional nature and unique facts of each particular arrangement.\n\nTo date, we have not been required to make any significant payment under any of the arrangements described above. We\nhave assessed the current status of performance/payment risk related to arrangements with limited guarantees, warranty\nobligations, unspecified limitations and/or indemnification provisions and believe that any potential payments would be\nimmaterial to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nLegal Contingencies\n\nAs of August 31, 2020, we or our present personnel had been named as a defendant in various litigation matters.
