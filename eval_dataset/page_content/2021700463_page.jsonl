The report identified  poisoning from accidentally ingesting e-liquids that contain nicotine, skin reactions  related to dermal contact with e-liquids, home blending/customization of e-liquids,  and using untested combinations of e-liquid and device or hardware customization  as potential risks.  \nI.   Introduction  \nIn 2014, the electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) market in the European Union (EU) was estimated  to be worth €2.16 billion (about  $\\mathrm{US}\\S2.41$   billion), with the biggest shares in the United Kingdom  (UK), Italy, Poland, and France. The most popular types of e-cigarettes were generally either  rechargeable with disposable cartridges or refillable e-cigarettes.  A 2017 Eurobarometer survey  found that, in general,   $15\\%$   of respondents in the EU overall have tried e-cigarettes, an increase  of   $3\\%$   since the survey was last conducted in 2014.  There is not much variation between the  individual Member States.  However, the younger the respondents were, the higher was the  number of people who have tried e-cigarettes.    "}

Regulation of Nicotine and Other Chemical Ingredients\nA. Caps on Nicotine Concentration\n\nThe maximum allowable nicotine concentration of vaping products is 20 milligrams (mg) per\nmilliliter (mL). Under normal conditions of use, vaping products must dispense nicotine in a\nconstant manner.5\n\nB. Other Chemical Ingredients\n\nDisposable e-cigarettes, refill bottles, and single-use cartridges that contain nicotine must only\ncontain “highly pure ingredients, except for trace elements that are technically inevitable in the\nmanufacturing process.”° Furthermore, the following additives are prohibited in disposable e-\ncigarettes, refill bottles, and single-use cartridges that contain nicotine:7\n\ne Additives that could cause consumers to believe that the product is beneficial to health, or\nthat the health risks are reduced\n\ne Additives and stimulants “associated with energy and vitality”\n\ne Additives that impart a color to the emissions\n\ne Additives that enhance the inhalation or absorption of nicotine\n\ne Additives that, without combustion, are carcinogenic, mutagenic, or toxic for\n\nhuman reproduction\n\nFurthermore, vaping products that contain nicotine may not contain any other ingredient that\nmay be dangerous for human health.§\n\n?

Legal Framework  \nThe regulation of e-cigarettes in Germany is determined both by European Union (EU) legislation  and domestic German law. The Tobacco Products Directive of the EU aims to harmonize rules  for the placing on the market and the labeling of nicotine-containing e-cigarettes in the Member  States.  Other aspects like the introduction of an age limit, smoke-free environments, or rules on  flavors are left to the Member States.  The deadline to transpose the directive into Member State  law was May 20, 2016.  Germany transposed the EU requirements in the Tobacco Products Act   ( Tabakerzeugnisgesetz, TabakerzG).  The German law adopts the definitions of the EU Tobacco  Products Directive.  In addition, the Youth Protection Act (Jugenschutzgesetz, JuSchG) 9  contains  provisions regarding age limits for e-cigarettes and e-shishas.  \nA.   Age Restrictions  \nIn 2016, the Youth Protection Act was amended to include e-cigarettes and e-shishas among the  products and containers that cannot be sold to children and adolescents in public places and that  they are forbidden from smoking. The prohibition also applies to mail-order offers and sales.   An adolescent is defined as a person between the age of fourteen and eighteen.    \nThe prohibition applies to tobacco products, other products that contain nicotine such as e- cigarettes, and nicotine-free products, including e-cigarettes and e-shishas where liquids are  evaporated through an electronic heating element and generate aerosols that are inhaled through  the mouth, as well as the products’ containers.  The definitions of tobacco products, related  products, and refill containers are taken from the EU Tobacco Products Directive.     \nAccording to the explanatory memorandum to the act that amended the Youth Protection Act,  reasons to include not only nicotine-containing e-cigarettes but also nicotine-free e-cigarettes and  e-shishas in the prohibition were, among others, that studies have found that the additional  ingredients of the liquids such as carbonyl compounds (formaldehyde, acrolein, and  acetaldehyde) may cause cancer and might affect proper lung function and development.  Furthermore, using nicotine-free e-cigarettes may tempt children and adolescents to try e- cigarettes with nicotine or conventional cigarettes.  14   "}

Regulation of E-Cigarette Environmental Waste  \nThere is no specific legislation in Sweden or the EU that specifically addresses environmental  waste from the disposal, storage, and recycling of e-cigarettes. However, EU requirements on the  handling of batteries apply (see the EU survey in this report). Thus, under Swedish law, all  electronic and battery-operated equipment, including e-cigarettes, must be sorted and disposed  of separately.  Waste management companies also recommend reselling electric equipment  (such as e-cigarettes) that still work.   \nIII.  Health Effects and Use for Smoking Cessation  \nThe Swedish government agency responsible for the regulation of e-cigarettes is the Public Health  Agency, which must   \npromote good public health, evaluate the effects of methods and strategies in the public  health field, monitor the health of the population and factors affecting it, through  knowledge building and dissemination of knowledge, promote health and prevent  diseases and injuries and promote effective infection prevention.

In response to two parliamentary\nquestions addressed to the Minister of Health on whether or how e-cigarettes were regulated\nunder the laws then in force,> the Ministry responded that nicotine-containing e-cigarette refills\nwere subject to the relevant licensing and control framework as medical products.

A recent exposé published\nby the newspaper Hiirriyet reported that the sale of e-cigarettes and refills took place through\nirregular channels and the articles were brought into the country either by way of smuggling or\nby travelers as personal items.‘*\n\nThe website of the Ministry of Health’s public antismoking campaign “Smokeless Airspace”\n[Dumansiz Hava Sahasi] currently appears to reflect the same position declared by the Ministry\nin its 2013 response to Parliamentary Question No. 7/20564. The website states that e-cigarettes\nare subject to the provisions of Law No. 4207 regardless of their content (i.e., whether or not\nthey are used with nicotine-containing refills), that no e-cigarette has been duly licensed, and\nthat the relevant products were smuggled into the country illicitly. The statement additionally\nexplains that e-cigarettes pose risks of accidentally overdosing on nicotine due to failures in\nrefill systems and that the refills may contain hazardous substances “similar to those contained\nin cigarettes [including] formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, diethylene glycol, nickel,\nchromium, lead, etc.”4 Interestingly, the website also cites a 2009 study conducted by the US\nFood and Drug Administration that found that ”some brands of electronic cigarettes contained\ncarcinogenic substances.” 47\n\nThe National Tobacco Control Strategy Document and Action Plan 2018-2023 published by the\nGovernment lists “the prevention of the trafficking, sale, and use of all unlicensed tobacco\nproducts and products imitating tobacco products, such as electronic cigarettes” as an action item\nunder the heading “prevention of illicit trade in tobacco products.” 48\n\nIn Government policy statements, no citations are made to any published scientific studies\nfocusing specifically on the prevalence or effects of e-cigarette use at the national level in Turkey.\nNevertheless, the Ministry of Health has consistently cited the lack of scientific studies on the\nlong-term effects of the inhalation of propylene glycol and other substances that exist in e-\ncigarette refills and of studies suggesting that e-cigarettes are efficient for nicotine cessation\n\n“4 Elif Yavuz et al., Simir tanimiyorlar!
