With the youth bulge in Sub-Saharan Africa,  prevention programs like DREAMS and novel testing among youth will be critical to  ensure new infections are not increasing. Use of granular and updated data on who is  not virally suppressed and other risk factors are essential for continuous public health  surveillance and response. PHIA among youth and men and surveys among key  populations will also provide critical information on the current epidemic leading  tailored programs and interventions.     \nApproved: June 4, 2022  "}
