At the end of 2020, we standardized our membership count methodology globally to be consistent with the U.S. and Canada, which resulted in the addition to the count of approximately 2.0 million total card holders for 2020, of which 1.3 million were paid members. The change did not impact 2019. Membership fee income and the renewal rate calculations were not affected. Our membership was made up of the following (in thousands): \nThe table provides data on memberships and cardholders for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. It includes:\n\n- **Gold Star**: \n  - 2021: 50,200\n  - 2020: 46,800\n  - 2019: 42,900\n\n- **Business, including affiliates**:\n  - 2021: 11,500\n  - 2020: 11,300\n  - 2019: 11,000\n\n- **Total paid members**:\n  - 2021: 61,700\n  - 2020: 58,100\n  - 2019: 53,900\n\n- **Household cards**:\n  - 2021: 49,900\n  - 2020: 47,400\n  - 2019: 44,600\n\n- **Total cardholders**:\n  - 2021: 111,600\n  - 2020: 105,500\n  - 2019: 98,500\n\nThe numbers reflect an increase across most categories over the years.\nPaid card holders (except affiliates) are eligible to upgrade to an Executive membership in the U.S. and Canada, for an additional annual fee of  $\\S60$  . Executive memberships are also available in Mexico, the U.K., Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, for which the additional annual fee varies. Executive members earn a  ${\\mathcal{Z}}\\%$   reward on qualified purchases (generally up to a maximum reward of  $\\mathbb{S}1{,}000$   per year), which can be redeemed only at Costco warehouses. This program also offers (except in Mexico and Korea), access to additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services, such as auto and home insurance, the Costco auto purchase program, and check printing. These services are generally provided by third parties and vary by state and country. Executive members totaled 25.6 million and represented   $55\\%$   of paid members\n\n (excluding affiliates) in the U.S. and Canada and   $17\\%$   of paid members (excluding affiliates) in our Other International operations at the end of\n\n 2021. They generally shop more frequently and spend more than other members. "}

The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the\npenetration of Executive membership, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Damage to our brands or reputation\nmay negatively impact comparable sales, diminish member trust, and reduce renewal rates and, accordingly, net sales and membership fee\nrevenue, negatively impacting our results of operations.\n\nWe sell many products under our Kirkland Signature brand. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of these\nproducts is essential to developing and maintaining member loyalty. These products also generally carry higher margins than national brand\nproducts and represent a growing portion of our overall sales. If the Kirkland Signature brand experiences a loss of member acceptance or\nconfidence, our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected.\n\nDisruptions in merchandise distribution or processing, packaging, manufacturing, and other facilities could adversely affect sales and\nmember satisfaction.\n\nWe depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process, primarily through our depots.

Our e-commerce business depends\nheavily on third-party and in-house logistics providers and that business is negatively affected when these providers are unable to provide\nservices in a timely fashion.\n\nWe may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends, which could negatively affect our relationship with our\nmembers, the demand for our products and services, and our market share.\n\nIt is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services that our members will desire. Our success depends, in part, on our\nability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences.

We define comparable\nsales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels, relocations and expansions, and sales-related to e-\ncommerce websites operating for more than one year. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new\nand existing members and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by\ncertain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange rates (with respect to the consolidation of the results of our\ninternational operations); and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive\nof these items, the more we can leverage certain of our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses, reducing them as a percentage of\nsales and enhancing profitability. Generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right\nmerchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-term. Another substantial factor in net\nsales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States.\nNet sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide range of global,\nnational and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce operations.

Changes in our net investment in merchandise inventories (the difference between merchandise inventories and accounts payable) is impacted by several factors, including how fast inventory is sold, the forward deployment of inventory to accelerate delivery times, payment terms with our suppliers, and early payments to obtain discounts from suppliers. \nCash Flows from Investing Activities \nNet cash used in investing activities totaled   $^{\\S3,535}$   in 2021, compared to   $\\S3{,}891$   in 2020, and is primarily related to capital expenditures. In 2020, we acquired Innovel (Costco Wholesale Logistics) and a minority interest in Navitus. Net cash flows from investing activities also includes purchases and maturities of short-term investments. \nCapital Expenditures \nOur primary requirements for capital are acquiring land, buildings, and equipment for new and remodeled warehouses. Capital is also required for information systems, manufacturing and distribution facilities, initial warehouse operations, and working capital. In 2021, we spent  $\\S3{,}588$   on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend approximately  $\\S3{,}800$   to  $\\mathbb{84}{,}200$   during fiscal 2022. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We opened 22 new warehouses, including two relocation s, in 2021, and plan to open approximately up to 35 additional new warehouses, including five relocation s, in 2022. We have experienced delays in real estate and construction activities due to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs or based on the current economic environment. \nCash Flows from Financing Activities \nNet cash used in financing activities totaled  $\\S6{,}488$   in 2021, compared to  $\\S1,147$   in 2020. Cash flows used in financing activities primarily related to the payment of dividends, repurchase s of common stock, and withholding taxes on stock-based awards. \nIn 2020, we issued  $\\S4{,}000$   in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and repaid  $\\S3{,}200$   of Senior Notes. \nStock Repurchase Programs \nDuring 2021 and 2020, we repurchased 1,358,000 and 643,000 shares of common stock, at average prices of   $\\S364.39$   and   $\\S308.45$  , respectively, totaling approximately   $\\S495$   and   $\\S198$  , respectively. These amounts may differ from the stock repurchase balances in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled stock repurchase s at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time-to-time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases and pursuant to plans under SEC Rule 10b5-1. Repurchased shares are retired, in accordance with the Washington Business Corporation Act. The remaining amount available to be purchased under our approved plan was   $\\S3{,}250$   at the end of 2021. "}

These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and related public and private sector policies and initiatives. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivable s were   $^{\\S1,816}$   and  $\\mathbb{S}1{,}636$   at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. "}

The 2019 Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of  17,500,000  shares (10,000,000  RSUs) of common stock for future grants, plus the remaining shares that were available for grant and the future forfeited shares from grants under the previous plan, up to a maximum aggregate of  27,800,000  shares (15,885,000 RSUs). The Company issues new shares of common stock upon vesting of RSUs. Shares for vested RSUs are generally delivered to participants annually, net of shares withheld for taxes. \nIn conjunction with a special cash dividend paid in the second quarter of 2021, and in accordance with the plans, the number of shares subject to outstanding RSUs was increased on the dividend record date to preserve their value. They were adjusted by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by a factor of 1.019 (rounded up to a whole share), representing the ratio of the Nasdaq closing price of   $\\S391.77$   on November 30, 2020, which was the last trading day immediately prior to the ex-dividend date, to the Nasdaq opening price of   $\\S384.50$   on the ex- dividend date, December 1, 2020. The outstanding RSUs increased by approximately 94,000. The adjustment did not result in additional stock- based compensation expense, as the fair value of the awards did not change. As further required by the plans, the maximum number of shares issuable was proportionally adjusted, which resulted in an additional 220,000 RSU shares available to be granted. "}
