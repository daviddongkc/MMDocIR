{"page": 4, "image_path": "doc_images/BESTBUY_2023_10K_4.jpg", "ocr_text": "Distribution\n\nCustomers within our Domestic and International segments who purchase product online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including\ncurbside pick-up for select products at most Domestic stores), at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes. Our ship-from-store\ncapability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution\ncenters.\n\nSuppliers and Inventory\n\nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately\n79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers — Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony — representing approximately 57% of total merchandise\npurchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that\nsecure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\n\nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to\nour inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt\nlevels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives, and agreements with vendors relating to\nreturn privileges for certain products.\n\nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products.\nStore Development\n\nWe had 1,138 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 throughout our Domestic and International segments.

We have also secured patents for many of our\ninventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our\nwebsites.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the\nmajority of the holiday shopping season.\n\nWorking Capital\n\nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our\nrevolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working\ncapital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.\n\nCompetition\n\nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile\nnetwork carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers. We believe our ability to help customers online, in our stores and in their homes, and\nto connect technology product and solutions with customer needs, provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating\nstructures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers, as maintaining price\ncompetitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we match a price offered by\ncertain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale\navailable to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our\nbroad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs; our unique\nability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.\n\n5\n", "vlm_text": "Distribution \nCustomers within our Domestic and International segments who purchase product online have the choice to pick up product at a Best Buy store (including curb side pick-up for select products at most Domestic stores),at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to their homes.Ourship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers.Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution Centers. \nSuppliers and Inventory \nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers.

A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majorityof the holiday shopping season. \nWorking Capital \nWe fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition,our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes, investments and growth opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales. \nCompetition \nOur competitors are primarily multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retailers, vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products and services directly to customers.We believe our ability to help customers online,in our stores and in their homes,and to connect technology product and solutions with customer needs,provides us key competitive advantages. Some of our competitors have lower cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price.We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers and service providers,as maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities.Inaddition,we have price-matching policies that allow customers to request that we matcha price offered by certain retail stores and online operators. In order to allow this,we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people; our integrated online, retail and in-home assets; our broad and curated product assortment; our strong vendor partnerships; our service and support offerings designed to solve real customer needs; our unique ability to showcase technology in distinct store formats and our supply chain are important ways in which we maintain our competitive advantage.

{"page": 8, "image_path": "doc_images/BESTBUY_2023_10K_8.jpg", "ocr_text": "External Risks\n\nMacroeconomic pressures, including, but not limited to, the current geopolitical climate, may adversely affect consumer spending and our financial\nresults.\n\nTo varying degrees, our products and services are sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. As a result, consumers\nmay be affected in many different ways, including, for example:\n\n+ whether or not they make a purchase;\n\n+ their choice of brand, model or price-point;\n\n+ how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and\n\n+ their appetite for complementary services (for example, Best Buy Totaltech).\n\nReal GDP growth, inflation (including wage inflation), consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels, oil prices, interest, tax and foreign\ncurrency exchange rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, limitations on a government's ability to borrow and/or spend capital, costs\nfor items such as fuel and food, any recession (and resulting corresponding declines in consumer sentiment) in response at least in part to central banks’ actions\nto reduce inflation, bank failures or limited liquidity in accessing bank deposits, and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the\nproducts and services that we offer. In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due\nto, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. We may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these\npressures.\n\nGeopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact\non our financial results. For example, the conflict in Ukraine may continue to significantly impact fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other\nmacroeconomic conditions, which may further adversely affect global economic growth, consumer confidence and demand for our products and services. Russia\nis a significant global producer of both fuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. Disruptions in the\nmarkets for those inputs or other inputs produced by Russia, whether due to sanctions, market pressure not to purchase inputs from Russia or otherwise, could\nincrease overall material costs for many of the products we sell. We cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict in Ukraine, nor\ncan we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of Russia, its allies or other countries with which Russia has\nsignificant trade or financial ties, including China. The conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated geopolitical tensions globally. Further deterioration of relations between\nTaiwan and China, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with China or political or economic\nconditions in Taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in the region, such as semiconductors and television panels sourced\nfrom Taiwan or the broader array of products sourced from China. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain, the cost\nof our products or our revenues and financial results.\n\nCatastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results.\n\nThe risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may consist of, or be\ncaused by, for example:\n\nnatural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change;\n\ndiseases or pandemics (including COVID-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners;\nearthquakes, floods, fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties, employees or customers;\n\npower loss, telecommunications failures, or software or hardware malfunctions; or\n\nterrorism, civil unrest, mass violence or violent acts, or other conflicts.\n\nIn recent years, we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets. Such events can adversely\naffect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. They can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply\nchain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the\nquantities and levels we require. Finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our\noperations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if\nexperienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in particular has had and may continue to subject our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks.

As a result, consumers maybe affected in many different ways,including,forexample: \nwhether or not they make a purchase; their choice of brand,model or price-point; how frequently they upgrade orreplace their devices; and their appetite for complementary services (for example, Best Buy Totaltech) \nReal GDP growth, inflation (including wage inflation), consumer confidence, the COVID-19 pandemic, employment levels, oil prices, interest, tax and foreign currency exchange rates, availability of consumer financing, housing market conditions, limitations on a government's ability to borrow and/or spend capital, costs for items such as fuel and food, any recession (and resulting corresponding declines in consumer sentiment) in response at least in part to central banks' actions to reduce inflation, bank failures or limited liquidity in accessing bank deposits, and other macroeconomic trends can adversely affect consumer demand for the products and services that we offer. In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due to,forexample,high consumer demand,component shortages and supply chain disruption.We maybe unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these pressures. \nGeopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.For example,the conflict in Ukraine may continue to significantly impact fuel prices, inflation, the global supply chain and other macroeconomic conditions,which may further adversely affect global economic growth,consumer confidence and demand for our products and services.Russia is a significant global producer of bothfuel and raw materials used in certain of the products we sell, including nickel, aluminum and copper. Disruptions in the markets for those inputs or other inputs produced by Russia,whether due to sanctions,market pressure not to purchase inputs from Russia or otherwise,could increase overall material costs for many of the products we sell.We cannot predict the extent or duration of sanctions in response to the conflict inUkraine,nor can we predict the effects of legislative or other governmental actions or regulatory scrutiny of Russia, its allies or other countries with which Russia has significant trade or financial ties,including China.The conflict in Ukraine has exacerbated geopolitical tensions globally.Further deterioration of relations between Taiwan and China, the resulting actions taken, the response of the international community and other factors affecting trade with China or political or economic conditions in Taiwan could disrupt the manufacturing of products or hardware components in theregion,such as semiconductors and television panels sourced from Taiwan or thebroader array of products sourced fromChina.Oneor moreof these factors could have a material adverse effect on our supply chain,thecost of our products or our revenues and financial results. \nCatastrophic events, including global pandemics such as the CoviD-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our operating results \nThe risk or actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Such events may consist of, or be causedby,forexample: \nnatural disasters or extreme weather events, including those related to climate change; diseases or pandemics (including CoViD-19) that have affected and may continue to affect our employees, customers or partners; earthquakes,floods,fires or other catastrophes affecting our properties,employees or customers; powerloss,telecommunications failures,or software or hardware malfunctions;or terrorism,civil unrest,mass violence or violent acts,or other conflicts. \nIn recent years,we have observed an increase in the number and severity of certain catastrophic events in many of our markets.Such events can adversely affect our workforce and prevent employees and customers from reaching our stores and properties. They can also disrupt or disable portions of our supply chain, distribution network and third-party business operations that may impact our ability to procure goods or services required for business operations at the quantities and levels we require. Finally, such events can also affect our information technology systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders. The adverse effects of any such catastrophic event would be exacerbated if experienced at the same time as another unexpected and adverse event, such as the CoviD-19 pandemic. \nThe CovID-19 pandemic in particular has had and may continue to subject our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks. These risks have included or may in the future continue to include:(i)significant reductions in customer visits to,and spending at,ourstores;(ii)significant disruptions to our supply chain; (ili) fluctuating consumer spending, particularly in light of the provision of government stimulus funds; (iv) novel changes to our operations, such as theroll-out of contactless,curb side pick-up for our goods,(v)the implementation of safety standards by various state andfederal agencies;(vi)risks related to the shift in channels in which customers choose to engage us, such as by switching to online shopping, which may affect our profitability; and (vi) our ability to finance our operations.

Such factors include, for example:\n\nchanging patterns of customer consumption and behavior, particularly in light of an evolving omnichannel environment;\nour ability to adjust store operating models to adapt to these changing patterns;\n\nthe location and appropriate number of stores, supply chain and other facilities in our portfolio;\n\nthe interior layout, format and size of our stores;\n\nthe products and services we offer at each store;\n\nthe local competitive positioning, trade area demographics and economic factors for each of our stores;\n\nthe primary term lease commitment and long-term lease option coverage for each store; and\n\nthe occupancy cost of our stores relative to market rents.\n\nIf we fail to effectively evaluate these factors or negotiate appropriate terms, or if unforeseen changes arise, the consequences could include, for example:\n\nclosing stores and abandoning the related assets, while retaining the financial commitments of the leases;\nincurring significant costs to remodel or transform our stores;\n\noperating stores, supply chain or service locations that no longer meet the needs of our business; and\nbearing excessive lease expenses.\n\nThese consequences could have a material adverse impact on our profitability, cash flows and liquidity.\n\nFor leased property, the financial impact of exiting a location can vary greatly depending on, among other factors, the terms of the lease, the condition of the local\nreal estate market, demand for the specific property, our relationship with the landlord and the availability of potential sub-lease tenants. It is difficult for us to\ninfluence some of these factors, and the costs of exiting a property can be significant. In addition to rent, we are typically still responsible for taxes, insurance and\ncommon area maintenance charges for vacant properties until the lease commitment expires or is terminated. Similarly, when we enter into a contract with a\ntenant to sub-lease property, we usually retain our obligations as the master lessee. This leaves us at risk for any remaining liability in the event of default by the\nsub-lease tenant.\n\nOperational Risks\n\nInterruptions and other factors affecting our stores and supply chain, including in-bound deliveries from our vendors, may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\n\nOur stores and supply chain assets are a critical part of our operations, particularly in light of industry trends and initiatives, such as ship-from-store and the\nemphasis on fast delivery when purchasing online. We depend on our vendors’ abilities to deliver products to us at the right location, at the right time and in the\nright quantities.

Any disruption to, or\ninefficiency in, our supply chain network, whether due to geopolitical conflicts, the COVID-19 pandemic or other factors, could damage our revenue and\nprofitability. The risks associated with our dependence on third parties are greater for small parcel home deliveries because of the relatively small number of\ncarriers with the scope and capacity required by our business.

Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are\ndiscussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in\n\nItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended\n\nOverview\n\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We\naccomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit\nour stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the\nU.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek\nSquad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com,\ntechliquidators.com and yardbird.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile\nand Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks. Our business, like that of many\nretailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping\nseason.\n\nComparable Sales\n\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores,\nwebsites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales\nincludes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and\nrepresents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or\ntake delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of\nthe date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers\nand dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or\nstores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of\nrevenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). All periods presented apply this methodology consistently.\n\nOn November 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”). On November 4, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of\nTwo Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”). Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of Current Health and Yardbird are excluded from\nour comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores,\nwebsites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies\nacross the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nThis MD8A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain adjusted\nor non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per\nshare (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information\nfor evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts\nand financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include\nadjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on certain investments,\nintangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-\nGAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors.

Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item8,Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,of thisAnnual Report onForm10-K.Refer toItem7,Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29,2022,for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended January29,2022, compared to theyear ended January30,2021,which is incorporated by reference herein. \nOverview \nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We accomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch tomeetour customers'everyday needs,whether they come tousonline,visit our stores or invite us into their homes.We have operations in the U.S.andCanada. \nWe have two report able segments:Domestic and International.The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states,districts and territories of the U.S.and our Best Buy Health business,and includes the brand names Best Buy,BestBuyAds,Best Buy Business,Best Buy Health,CST,Current Health,Geek Squad,Lively,Magnolia,Pacific Kitchen and Home,Tech Liquidators and Yard bird and the domain names best buy.com,current health.com,lively.com tech liquidators.com and yardbird.com.The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy,Best Buy Mobile and Geek Squad and the domain name best buy.ca. \nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January.Fiscal 2023,fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks.Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping Sseason. \nComparable Sales \nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, websites and call centers by measuring thechange innet sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length.Comparable sales includes revenue from stores,websites and call centers operating for atleast 14 full months.Revenue from online sales is included incomparable sales and represents sales initiated on a website or app,regardless of whether customers choose to pick upproduct in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or take delivery direct to theirhomes.Revenue from acquisitions is included incomparable sales beginning with the firstfull quarter following thefirst anniversary of the date of the acquisition. Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers and dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or stores impacted by natural disasters,is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening.Comparable sales excludes the impact of revenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates(applicable to our International segment only).All periods presented apply this methodology consistently. \nOn November 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (\"Current Health\"). On November 4, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (\"Yardbird\"). Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of Current Health and Yardbird are excluded from our comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024. \nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metricfor investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, websites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers' methods. \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), as well as certain adjusted ornon-GAAP financial measures,such as constant currency,non-GAAP operating income,non-GAAP effective taxrate andnon-GAAP diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\"). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information for evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts and financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on certain investments. intangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non- GAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors. We provide reconciliations of the most comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP to presented non-GAAP financial measures that enable investors to understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and to evaluate performance using the same metrics as management. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes. "}

These decreases were partially offset by positive cash flows from operations,primarily driven by earnings \nOur cash deposits held at financial institutions may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally,these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit. We limit exposure relating to financial instruments by diversifying the financial instruments among various counter parties,which consist primarily of major financial institutions. \nCash Flows \nThe table presents a summary of cash flows for the years 2023, 2022, and 2021. It details the total cash provided by or used in different activities, which include operating, investing, and financing activities, as well as the effect of exchange rate changes on cash. Finally, it shows the overall increase or decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for each year.

The level of\nvendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n\nGoodwill\n\nDescription\n\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects our estimate of the price\na potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction.\n\nWe have goodwill in two reporting units — Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health — with carrying values of $492\nmillion and $891 million, respectively, as of January 28, 2023.\n\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) models and market\ndata, such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices, for observable comparable companies. DCF models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers,\nsuch as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many\nuncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and\nmacroeconomic trends.\n\nEffects if actual results differ from assumptions\n\nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Compared to fiscal 2022, the\nexcess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy’s market capitalization over the same period,\nreflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further\ndeterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote.\n\nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In\nboth fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. In fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more\nsignificantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue\ngrowth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the\nmore uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher\nthan for our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit.\n\nInventory Markdown\n\nDescription\n\nOur merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion as of January 28, 2023. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the\nestablishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate\nsale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.\n\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\n\nMarkdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected\nrevenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such\nas product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of\nultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs.\n\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our markdown adjustment as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $14 million in fiscal 2023. The level of\nmarkdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\n\nTax Contingencies\n\nDescription\n\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and\namount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the\nvarious taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of\nyears may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for\nunrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the\nrelevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax\nlaw, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n\n32\n", "vlm_text": "Effect if actual results differ from assumptions \nA  $10\\%$  change in our vendor funding deferral as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately  $\\S45$  million infiscal 2023.Thelevel of vendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years. \nGoodwill \nDescription \nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in thefiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value.Fair value reflects our estimate of the price a potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction. \n $\\S492$  We have goodwill in two reporting units - Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health - with carrying values of millionand  $\\S891$  million,respectively,as of January 28,2023. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment.We use a combination of discounted cash flow(\"DcF\") models and market data,such as earnings multiples and quoted market prices,for observable comparable companies.Dc F models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, such as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many uncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and macroeconomic trends. \nEffects if actual results differ from assumptions \nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit,fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.Compared to fiscal 2022,the excess of fair value overbook value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately inline with the decline in Best Buy's market capitalization over the same period, reflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future.Barring a fundamental,material further deterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote. \nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In bothfiscal 2023and fiscal2022,theexcess of fair value overbook value for this reporting unit was substantial. Infiscal 2023,the excess decreased more significantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue growth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the more uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher thanfor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit. \nInventory Markdown \nDescription \nOur merchandise inventories were  $\\S5.1$  billion as of January 28,2023.We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the establishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect torealize from the ultimate sale orother disposal of inventory and establisha new cost basis.No adjustment is recorded for inventory thatwe expect to return to our vendorsfor full credit. \nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate \nMarkdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected revenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such as product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor return rights and the expected sales channel of ultimate disposition. We also apply judgment in the assumptions about other components of net realizable value, such as vendor allowances and selling costs \nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions \nA  $10\\%$  change in our markdown adjustment as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately  $\\S14$  million in fiscal 2023.Thelevel of markdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years. \nTax Contingencies \nDescription \nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax fling positions, including the timing and amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter,for which we have established a liability,is audited and fully resolved or clarified.We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax law,the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures,the level of earnings and the results of tax audits. "}

The goodwill balance\nwas $1,383 million as of January 28, 2023, of which $891 million was related to the Best Buy Health reporting unit.

Where confirmation responses from vendors were not received, we completed alternative procedures such as agreement to underlying contractual arrangements, tested the settlement of the arrangement and held discussions with a sample of Company buyers to understand the terms of the agreement.

Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a\nreserve for expected credit losses, which is primarily based on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $30 million and $39\nmillion as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We had $41 million and $52 million of write-offs in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\n\nMerchandise Inventories\n\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted-average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which\nincludes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs\nassociated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of sales on our\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings.\n\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of\ninventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis. Subsequent changes\nin facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded markdown adjustments or an increase in the newly established cost basis.\n\nOur inventory valuation reflects adjustments for physical inventory losses (resulting from, for example, theft). Physical inventory is maintained through a\ncombination of full location counts (typically once per year) and more regular cycle counts.\n\nProperty and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost. We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in\nservice to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if they are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used\nfor income tax purposes.\n\nWhen property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and any resulting\ngain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n\nRepairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized\nand depreciated.\n\nCosts associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software,\ngenerally from two years to five years.

When\nevaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted\nfuture cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The\nimpairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash\nflows. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset's estimated fair value.\n\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis. For store locations, our primary indicator that asset carrying values may not be recoverable is\nnegative store operating income for the most recent 12-month period.

For example, long-lived assets deployed at store locations are reviewed for impairment at\neither the individual store level or at the local market level. Such reviews involve comparing the net carrying value of all assets to the net cash flow projections for\neach store or market. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets\nshared by several areas of operations, such as information technology systems.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our store operations was a triggering event to review for potential\nimpairments of our store assets. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an immaterial asset impairment charge for a small number of stores within SG&A. No\nother triggering events were identified for the periods presented.\n\nLeases\n\nThe majority of our lease obligations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our finance leases are primarily equipment-\nrelated. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as\neither operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it is determined that a lease exists.

For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Accounting Standard’s Codification 842, Leases, in fiscal\n2020, we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on\nour Consolidated Balance Sheets; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nOperating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at the\ncommencement date. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on an evaluation of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for\ncollateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates commensurate with the terms of the lease. Our operating\nleases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable\nlease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to combine\nlease and non-lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are reduced by lease incentives. We\ngenerally do not include options to extend or terminate a lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain\npredetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nGoodwill\n\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment\nannually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor the existence of\npotential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by identifying\ncomponents of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment\nmanagement. We have goodwill in two reporting units - Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health — with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million,\nrespectively, as of January 28, 2023.\n\nOur detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a\npotential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows\nand other market information, such as trading multiples and other observable metrics. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we conclude\nthat no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to\nthe excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nOur valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of acquisition, using income and\nmarket approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate.\n\nWe amortize our definite-lived intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We review these assets for impairment whenever events or\nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable and monitor for the existence of potential impairment\nindicators throughout the fiscal year.

The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a\ncomponent of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being\nhedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to\ncircumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and losses, if\nany, related to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.\n\nInterest Rate Swaps\n\nWe utilized “receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate” interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our $500 million principal amount of\nnotes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”).

Under the shortcut method,\nwe recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\n\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\n\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable\nbalances denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in\nhedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on these contracts directly to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\n\nFair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset\nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based\nupon observable and non-observable inputs:\n\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\n\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly,\nincluding:\n\n. Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n\n. Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets;\n\n* — Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and\n\n* Inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment.\nThese values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management's estimates of market participant assumptions.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the\nconsideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\n\nFair value remeasurements are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a discounted cash flow\n(“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected to generate. The key inputs to the DCF model\ngenerally include our forecasts of net cash generated from investment operations, as well as an appropriate discount rate.\n\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets,\nwhich are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these assets, we do not periodically adjust\ncarrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair\nvalue and the difference is recorded within SG&A and Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non-restructuring and restructuring\ncharges, respectively.\n\n47\n", "vlm_text": "Derivatives \nNet Investment Hedges \nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our Canadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a component of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged,until the investment is sold or liquidated.We limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation.Wereport the gains and losses,if any, related to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings. \nInterest Rate Swaps \nWeutilized\"“receive fixed-rate,pay variable-rate”interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our\\$5 oo million principal amount of notes due October 1,2028(\"2028Notes\").Our interest rateswap contracts are considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional amounts match those of our fixed-rate debt being hedged and are,therefore,accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method.Under the shortcut method we recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the carrying value of the debt.
