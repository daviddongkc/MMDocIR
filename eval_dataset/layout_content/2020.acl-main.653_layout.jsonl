The ﬁrst,  cross-lingual transfer  (XLT), requires training a model with  $(c_{x},q_{x},a_{x})$   training data in language  $x$  , in our case English. Development data in language  $x$   is used for tuning. At test time, the model must extract answer    $a_{y}$   in language  $y$   given context  $c_{y}$   and ques- tion  $q_{y}$  . The second task,  generalized cross-lingual transfer  (G-XLT), is trained in the same way, but at test time the model must extract    $a_{z}$   from    $c_{z}$   in language    $z$   given  $q_{y}$   in language  $y$  . This evaluation setup is possible because MLQA is highly parallel, allowing us to swap  $q_{z}$   for    $q_{y}$   for parallel instances without changing the question’s meaning.

Our annotation method restricts answers to come from speciﬁed sentences. Despite being provided several sentences of context, some annotators may be tempted to only read the parallel sentence and write questions which only require a single sentence of context to answer. However, single sentence context questions are a known issue in SQuAD annotation in general ( Sugawara et al. , 2018 ) suggesting our method would not result in less challenging questions, supported by scores on MLQA-en being similar to SQuAD (section  5.3 ).

Since MLQA will be freely available, this was done to reduce the risk of test data over-ﬁtting in future, and to estab- lish standard splits. However, in our experiments, we only make use of the English development data and study strict zero-shot settings. Other evalua- tion setups could be envisioned, e.g. by exploiting the target language development sets for hyper- parameter optimisation or ﬁne-tuning, which could be fruitful for higher transfer performance, but we leave such “few-shot” experiments as future work. Other potential areas to explore involve training datasets other than English, such as CMRC ( Cui et al. ,  2018 ), or using unsupervised QA techniques to assist transfer ( Lewis et al. ,  2019 ).

The F1 scores for different answer types relative to overall F1 score are shown for various Named Entity types in Figure  8 .

We then evaluated the mean F1 score for each language on the two subsets, with the results shown in Figure 4 . We see that questions that are “easy” in English also seem to be easier in the target languages, but the drop in performance for the “hard” subset is not as dramatic as one might expect. This suggests that not all questions that are hard in English in MLQA are hard in the target languages. This could be due to the grammar and morphology of differ- ent languages leading to questions being easier or more difﬁcult to answer, but an another factor is that context documents can be shorter in target lan- guages for questions the model struggled to answer correctly in English, effectively making them eas- ier. Manual inspection suggests that whilst context documents are often shorter for when the model is correct in the target language, this effect is not sufﬁcient to explain the difference in performance.
