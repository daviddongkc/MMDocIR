After a slight decline in 2018, drug overdose deaths in\nthe United States increased to over 72,000 in 2019, according to preliminary data from the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the 12 months ending in May 2020, the\nCDC recorded over 81,000 drug overdose deaths, the highest number ever in a 12-month period,\nwith the largest increases occurring at the same time that U.S. cases of COVID-19 exploded in\nMarch, April, and May of 2020.\n\nThe pandemic not only magnified the lethal effects of drug use, but also hampered counter drug\nefforts as governments diverted resources to other public health needs. Among the highest\nnumbers of lives lost to the virus were those of law enforcement first responders. Social\ndistancing, economic hardship, quarantine efforts, and delayed medical care due to overloaded\nhealth systems reduced access to treatment for drug users.\n\nThe pandemic also initially hindered criminal activity. Border closures and travel restrictions\ndisrupted trafficking routes and precursor chemical supply chains. However, traffickers quickly\nadopted alternative routes and methods, and drug availability in many regions reached new\nhistoric highs by year’s end. In Europe, demand for cocaine from South America increased, as\nseizures and demand for treatment remained at record levels. Methamphetamine production,\ntrafficking, and use set new record levels in many regions, especially in Southeast Asia and parts\nof Africa and North America. New psychoactive substances (NPS) expanded to new markets,\nthe most lethal forms of which were synthetic opioids that enabled criminals to avoid\ninternational controls.\n\nThe United States contributed approximately $95 million in 2020 to alleviate pandemic-related\nthreats to law enforcement. This included provision of personal protective equipment in over 35\ncountries and support for infrastructure improvements to enable social distancing and improve\nsafety — for example, by reducing prison overcrowding.\n\nThe enormous challenges in 2020 led to mixed results in the fight against illicit drugs. For\nexample, the Andean region has long been, and remains, a key area of concern among drug\nsource and transit countries.

To achieve these objectives, INL supports the following:  \n•   Developing professional networks of drug prevention, treatment, and recovery educators  and practitioners by providing training, mentoring, and credentialing based on evidence- based practices;  \n•   Development of drug-free community coalitions internationally, involving law  enforcement and public/private social institutions, aimed at preventing drug use and its  consequences;  \n  Research, development, and outcome-based evaluation efforts to determine the  effectiveness of drug prevention and treatment programs.   \nSignificant completed and ongoing INL-funded demand reduction projects for 2020 include:  \nUniversal Curriculum Training and Credentialing:   Through international organizations – the  Colombo Plan (Asia-Pacific region), the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),  and the Organization of American States (OAS), INL supports efforts to strengthen the ability of  the drug demand reduction (DDR) workforce to provide drug prevention, treatment, and  recovery services through intensive trainings and credentialing examinations at the national  level.

While these are signs\nof progress, more must be done.\n\nMexico remains the source of nearly all heroin and methamphetamine seized in the United\nStates, and is a transit route for most of the cocaine available in our country. Moreover, Mexican\ncartels take advantage of uneven precursor chemical controls in Mexico to manufacture deadly\ndrugs, such as fentanyl, inside Mexico and smuggle them into the United States. Mexican drug\ninterdictions remain far too low in the face of these critical drug threats. These cartels present a\nclear threat to Mexico and the Mexican government’s ability to exert effective control over parts\nof its country.\n\nMexico must clearly demonstrate its commitment to dismantling the cartels and their criminal\nenterprises and do more to protect the lives of Mexican and American citizens threatened by\nthese groups. Mexico needs to continue to extradite key criminal actors, step up comprehensive\ninvestigations and drug and asset seizures, and implement a robust data-based poppy eradication\nprogram tied to sustainable alternative development. The Mexican government should\nacknowledge the alarming trend of fentanyl production inside its territory. It must prioritize law\nenforcement action targeting cartel production and trafficking of fentanyl — the leading substance\ninvolved in drug overdose deaths in the United States — and strengthen efforts targeting fentanyl\nprecursor chemicals overwhelmingly trafficked from China, as well as fentanyl smuggling and\nproduction.

DEA foreign offices are tasked with four principal missions:\n\ne Conduct bilateral and multilateral investigations with host country law enforcement\npartners;\n\n¢ Coordinate counternarcotic intelligence gathering with host governments;\n\ne Implement training programs for host country police and prosecutor agencies;\n\ne Support the advancement and development of host country drug law enforcement\ninstitutions.\n\nThe emphasis placed on each objective is determined by the host nation’s unique circumstances\nas they relate to their drug trafficking threat, infrastructure, and law enforcement capabilities.\nDEA has very successful Non-Sensitive Investigative Unit (Non-SIU) and Sensitive\nInvestigative Unit (SIU) Programs, which other agencies consider model programs. These\nprograms receive funding from the Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and\nLaw Enforcement (INL). DEA works side by side with host nation counterparts to develop\nrelevant training, promote intelligence sharing, conduct bilateral investigations, and support joint\ncounter-drug operations. The vast majority of DEA foreign efforts and resources are dedicated\nto conducting international drug and drug money laundering investigations. In Fiscal Year (FY)\n2020, there were 17 active Interagency Agreements (IAAs) under which INL provided funding\nsupport to capacity building and training of DEA’s host nation counterparts.

In FY20, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 resulted\nin classes being postponed during the period March to October.

As part of this mission, DEA seeks to bring to justice the criminal organizations  and principal members of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) based in the United States or  foreign nations involved in the cultivation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances,  as well as the money laundering of illicit finances derived from drug trafficking.   \nTo achieve this mission, DEA has nearly 10 percent of its Special Agent and Intelligence Analyst  work force permanently assigned overseas at 89 DEA foreign offices located in 67 countries.   DEA’s foreign offices act as conduits of actionable and strategic information, intelligence, and  evidence to law enforcement and prosecutorial components in the United States and vice versa.  In this manner, DEA is able to identify, target, and dismantle the entire global spectrum of the  DTOs.  DEA foreign offices are tasked with four principal missions :   \n•   Conduct bilateral and multilateral investigations with host country law enforcement  partners;   •   Coordinate counternarcotic intelligence gathering with host governments;   •   Implement training programs for host country police and prosecutor agencies;   •   Support the advancement and development of host country drug law enforcement  institutions.  \nThe emphasis placed on each objective is determined by the host nation’s unique circumstances  as they relate to their drug trafficking threat, infrastructure, and law enforcement capabilities.   DEA has very successful Non-Sensitive Investigative Unit (Non-SIU) and Sensitive  Investigative Unit (SIU) Programs, which other agencies consider model programs.  These  programs receive funding from the Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement (INL).  DEA works side by side with host nation counterparts to develop  relevant training, promote intelligence sharing, conduct bilateral investigations, and support joint  counter-drug operations.  The vast majority of DEA foreign efforts and resources are dedicated  to conducting international drug and drug money laundering investigations.  In Fiscal Year (FY)  2020, there were 17 active Interagency Agreements (IAAs) under which INL provided funding  support to capacity building and training of DEA’s host nation counterparts.  One of these  programs includes DEA’s partnership with the Department of Justice International Criminal  Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP) Program for critical support to Senegal.  \nInternational Training :  DEA’s International Training Office (TRI) has provided training,  mentoring, and capacity building for our international partners for over 25 years.  TRI is  comprised of four dedicated Mobile Training Teams, which provide training on an annual basis.   All DEA international training programs have as a major objective the building of regional  working relationships between countries.  In FY20, travel restrictions due to COVID-19 resulted  in classes being postponed during the period March to October.  However, TRI successfully  conducted 87 courses overseas, training over 2,500 foreign law enforcement counterparts from  88 different countries.  Courses were conducted at the Department of State’s International Law  Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Central America, and other host  nation training facilities around the world.

During the preparation of the 2021 CMEA report as well as determination and  certification, GTA data for U.S. exports and imports for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for  calendar years 2017-2019 were updated in light of revised estimates provided by the U.S. Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA).     \nOverall, the accuracy of this trade data should be viewed with caution, as some countries have  less sophisticated infrastructures and methodologies at their disposal than others for measuring  the volume, overall trends, and commodities involved in legitimate trade.  Furthermore, this data  cannot accurately identify the specific trends of smuggling or diversion involving subterfuge.    \nThe trade data source employed in this determination and certification does not reflect illicit  smuggling or production around the globe that has been detected by law enforcement and other  reporting.  Nor does it reflect an accurate disparity between requirements and imports.  Available  trade data from GTA is also silent on legitimate commercial sales of alternative precursor  chemicals used in methamphetamine production, which comprise a growing proportion of  chemicals used in the manufacture of methamphetamine, particularly for the U.S. market.    \nThus far, the economic and compliance analyses required by the CMEA remain challenging  because of insufficient, unreliable, and changing data.  Often the collection and reporting of such  data requires a regulatory infrastructure that is beyond the means of some governments.  Further,  not all countries are familiar with the methodology and data sources used by the GTA to report  the final numbers, and some countries dispute the accuracy of the data.  This increases the  difficulty of comparing import or export totals across years.  Therefore, it remains difficult to  determine with precision the top five countries exporting and importing the largest amount of  pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.   \nNevertheless, the United States will continue to urge countries in bilateral and multilateral  diplomatic and technical forums to report on their licit domestic requirements for  methamphetamine precursor chemicals to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).   The United States will also continue to work with the INCB and with authorities in the reporting  countries to secure explanations for anomalies between reported imports and reported licit  domestic requirements, and to follow the development of other chemicals used in the production  of methamphetamine.      \nThe newest method to produce methamphetamine is the nitrostyrene method, which starts from  benzaldehyde and nitroethane, to produce phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P) or from the intermediary  product 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene.  This method has been the preferred alternative used by  Mexican drug trafficking organizations in recent years to manufacture the precursor chemicals  required to produce methamphetamine.

These tend to be low production\noperations (grams) and make up only a small percentage of methamphetamine that is consumed\nin the United States. “One-pot labs” (“shake-n-bake” labs) constitute the majority of SPCLs\nfound domestically.

In March\n2020, the CND approved a decision to schedule another methamphetamine pre-precursor, methyl\nalpha-phenylacetoacetate (MAPA), for control under the 1988 Convention.

Governments will continue to have the most significant role in reducing the threat, but the\nprivate sector, international organizations, and civil society also play important roles.\n\nPreventive efforts to stop illicit synthetic drug production and trafficking requires expanded\ncooperation with private industry.

These rudimentary laboratories typically use two-liter plastic soda bottles,  containers, and other such receptacles.    \nPseudoephedrine and ephedrine are the principal precursor chemicals used in domestic SPCLs  and are purchased over the counter from retail pharmacies and convenience stores.  Most of the  methamphetamine available in the United States, however, is produced in Mexico, and  trafficking across the U.S. southern border has increased dramatically in recent years.  The vast  majority (over 90 percent) of large-scale methamphetamine manufacturers in Mexico are  believed to use the P-2-P method, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.  CBP  seizures of methamphetamine over the Southwest border in 2020 totaled approximately 78.3  metric tons, up from approximately 66.1 metric tons in 2019 and 29.3 tons in 2017.    \nOutside of North America, production techniques vary, but many producers still rely upon  ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, while others have shifted to alternative chemicals such as  APAA (alpha-phenyl ace to acetamide), a pre-precursor that was added to the list of controlled  chemicals under the 1988 UN Convention by a March 2019 decision of the CND.  In March  2020, the CND approved a decision to schedule another methamphetamine pre-precursor, methyl  alpha-phenyl ace to acetate (MAPA), for control under the 1988 Convention.  There are no  legitimate uses of MAPA according to the INCB, and there has been an increase in seizures of  the substance in association with clandestine drug labs since 2018.    \nThe Road Ahead  \nAs the global synthetic drug threat continues to evolve and expand, the United States will seek to  expand its partnerships with both traditional and emerging stakeholders to confront and contain  it.  Governments will continue to have the most significant role in reducing the threat, but the  private sector, international organizations, and civil society also play important roles.    \nPreventive efforts to stop illicit synthetic drug production and trafficking requires expanded  cooperation with private industry.  The majority of the world’s chemical and pharmaceutical  industries are privately owned, as are the information communication platforms, online- marketing and sales platforms, online-payment providers, and express consignment operators  "}

The Dutch Caribbean with U.S. law enforcement support  seized over   $\\mathrm{6,000\\,kg}$   of cocaine in the first 10 months of 2020.   \n3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   \nDrug treatment and prevention is accomplished through a combination of privately and publicly  funded foundations on each of the islands.  Sint Maarten has one drug treatment foundation,  which suffered severe damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and has yet to fully recover.   "}

On August 4, Ecuadorian police and navy units working with U.S. law enforcement and  security partners from Mexico and Colombia executed a successful operation leading to a 2.2  MT cocaine seizure in Mexico’s waters.  \nMaritime seizures of all illicit drugs totaled 2.67 MT during the first 10 months of 2020,  compared to approximately  $3.9\\,\\mathrm{{MT}}$   during the same period in 2019.  Ecuadorian Coast Guard  officials attributed the decrease to a reduced budget and limited operations during the COVID-19  pandemic.  During the first 10 months of 2020, the police detected three drug trafficking aircrafts  and located nine clandestine airstrips in Guayas, Manabi, El Oro, Los Rios, and Santa Elena  provinces.   \nDrug traffickers use cargo and shipping containers to smuggle drugs out of Ecuador, often  concealing drugs in legitimate cargo.  Guayaquil is a major transshipment hub for cocaine  concealed in container cargo shipped to Europe.  In one of Guayaquil’s largest ports, concession  holder Contecon employs security measures at its facility but the police inspect only 15 percent  of containerized exports.  During the first 10 months of 2020, the police conducted 52,083  container inspections in the four Guayaquil ports and the Posorja Port that ship containerized  cargo, compared to 51,436 inspected containers in these five ports in all of 2019.  In 2020, U.S.  officials posted to Guayaquil continued to work with Ecuadorian authorities to secure maritime  cargo under the Container Security Initiative established in 2018.  \nEcuador is not a major drug producing country.  During the first 10 months of 2020, Ecuador  eradicated 13,007 coca plants, or approximately 1.3 hectares, including 500 coca plants in the  northern border province of Esmeraldas; 12,004 coca plants in the northern border province of  Sucumbios; 500 coca plants in the coastal province of Santo Domingo de los Tsachilas; and three  plants in the Amazonian province of Napo.  Synthetic drug production and consumption is an  issue of growing concern for Ecuadorian authorities.   "}

Introduction  \nGhana is a transit and destination point for illicit drugs trafficked from Asia and South America  to other African nations and Europe, and to a lesser extent the United States.  Cocaine from  South America and heroin and controlled pharmaceuticals from Asia are smuggled into the  country for limited local consumption and onward shipment.  Crystal methamphetamine  produced in clandestine laboratories in Nigeria also transit the country.  Precursor chemicals  required to produce crystal methamphetamine are believed to be diverted from Ghanaian  sources.   \nPorous borders and a lack of resources hamper Ghana’s efforts to combat the illegal drug trade.   Cannabis is also produced in substantial quantities, primarily for domestic use, although  authorities believe an increasing amount is trafficked to international markets in the region or to  Europe.  Officials report that the illegal importation and abuse of tramadol, a controlled  pharmaceutical, is increasingly problematic.  Ghana is not a significant source or transit country  for drugs entering the United States.   \nGhana continues to work productively with international partners on law enforcement operations  targeting transnational drug trafficking organizations and to attend U.S.-sponsored trainings that  improve their capabilities, though COVID-19 affected such efforts throughout most of 2020.  \nB.

Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  \n1.  Institutional Development  \nCorruption, combined with low tax collection rates, deprives law enforcement agencies, courts,  and prosecutors of resources required to stop the flow of drugs and bring traffickers to justice.   The security tax – instituted in 2014 to offset funding challenges – has helped security agencies,  but funds remain inadequate to meet the significant personnel, equipment, and technology needs,  especially in remote areas of the country.  Already limited resources were further strained by the  COVID pandemic.    \nThrough cooperation with the United States and other international partners, the Honduran  Government has established basic criminal justice infrastructure to investigate, interdict, and  prosecute drug traffickers.  Honduras has an extradition treaty with the United States and  actively cooperates on extraditions.  The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with  Honduras to suppress illicit traffic by sea, which includes provisions for ship boarding, ship  riders, pursuit, entry to investigate, and overflight.

Cannabis is  primarily grown in northern Sumatra and other parts of Indonesia for domestic consumption.    \nAn emerging trend during the COVID-19 global pandemic is the sale of small amounts of  narcotics on social media accounts, such as Instagram, for individual use.  The Indonesian  Government, including the Anti-Narcotics Agency (BNN) and Indonesia National Police (INP),  continued efforts to investigate, disrupt, interdict and prosecute crimes related to illicit narcotics  in 2020.  \nB.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  \n1.  Institutional Development  \nThe central government had initially planned to increase BNN’s budget by 6.24 percent this  year; however, due to COVID-19, the budget was cut by 4.11 percent, resulting in a final budget  of  $^{\\S11,241,379}$  .  In September 2020, the head of BNN, Heru Winarko, went before the  Indonesian congress and secured an 8 percent increase for BNN’s 2021 budget.   \nIn May, BNN received high marks for its annual financial audit by the Indonesia supreme audit  agency (BPK); in response to the minor recommendations suggested by BPK, BNN issued  internal regulations regarding the processing of petty cash and encouraging the use of  government credit cards instead of cash transactions.     \nBNN is actively maintaining and building relationships with international partners including the  United States that share similar views regarding the global challenge posed by the drug trade, the  threat of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), and the importance of reducing demand by  supporting drug rehabilitation programs.     \n2.  Supply Reduction  \nBetween January and September 2020, BNN investigated 43 narcotics cases resulting in the  seizure and destruction of  601.77 kilograms   $(\\mathrm{kg})$   of crystal methamphetamine, 193,133 MDMA  pills, and 1.61 tons of cannabis .  In March, following a raid in Jakarta, BNN  seized 62.28 liters  of liquid precursor and 6.81 kilograms  $\\left(\\mathrm{kg}\\right)$   of powder precursor.  As a result of joint  "}

National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   \nThe U.S. and Jamaican governments coordinate closely on shared priorities related to illicit drug  control, including investigative capacity, customs cooperation, maritime security, and support to  the judicial system.   \nThe United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence  affecting Jamaican citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).   CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and nations of the Caribbean that seeks  to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and security, promote social justice, and  prevent youth crime and violence.  CBSI support to Jamaica includes training, equipment, and  logistical assistance for interdicting illicit drugs and trafficked firearms and for combating money  laundering, financial fraud, and other organized crime.   \nThe U.S. government has supported the JCF’s Narcotics Division and the JDF’s Military  Intelligence Unit and Coast Guard with equipment and training.  The United States also funds  projects to improve the effectiveness of prosecutors and the courts.   \nD.  Conclusion   \nCooperation between Jamaica and the United States related to drug trafficking and transnational  crime continued to be strong in 2020.  Significant progress against drug trafficking will depend  on efforts to target high-level drug traffickers, combat corruption, increase extraditions, finalize  and implement a national drug strategy, and strengthen the judicial system so drug traffickers are  held criminally accountable.

Introduction \nThe Kyrgyz Republic’s geographic location, limited resources, and weak criminal justice system  make it a prime transshipment location.  The Kyrgyz Republic lies along a significant transit  route for illegal drugs moving north from Afghanistan to Russia, and then sometimes into  Europe.  Illicit drugs are often smuggled into the country from Tajikistan across un-demarcated  borders.  Information on drug use in the Kyrgyz Republic is not readily available, but it is  believed that drug use is a growing problem.    \nThe Counter Narcotics Service (CNS) under the Kyrgyz Ministry of  Interior (MOI) is  responsible for countering illicit trafficking of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances, and their  precursors.  The Ministry of Health has oversight over the legal use of narcotic drugs for medical  purposes.  The Kyrgyz Republic has shown a commitment to fighting drug use.  CNS enhanced  international and inter-agency cooperation mechanisms for countering illicit drug trafficking by  signing a cooperation agreement with the Afghan Ministry of Interior (MOI).  Domestically, the  Kyrgyz Republic continues to work on identifying new types of psychoactive substances,  coordinating law enforcement activities to improve drug interdiction, and improving border  controls.   \nB.

Local authorities work with the United States and other international partners to combat  transnational crime.  With U.S. assistance, the LDEA developed a database to track  investigations in 2019.  The LDEA also expanded coordination with Interpol’s West African  Police Information System and the organizations plan to share regional information on  trafficking networks.  LDEA has also taken steps to improve internal standard operating  procedures for international requests and continues to increase its personnel administrative  capacity through a new human resources development plan.   \nLiberian investigations and prosecutions of drug trafficking have improved since the 2014 LDEA  Act and Controlled Drugs and Substances Act came into effect.  The LDEA continues to  improve its operational capacity and professionalism through use of confidential sources; work  with private businesses; initiation of controlled deliveries; investigation of international  smuggling groups; and inter-agency coordination.   \nThe United States-Liberia extradition treaty dates from 1939.  While no mutual legal assistance  treaty between Liberia and the United States exists, Liberia is a party to multilateral conventions  that enable such cooperation.   "}

Also, according to CENAPI, during the first nine months of 2020  Mexico seized   $10.35\\;\\mathrm{MT}$   of cocaine (a 23 percent increase compared to the first nine months of  2019);   $125.9\\,\\mathrm{MT}$   of marijuana (8 percent decrease compared to the same period in CY19); 40.22  kg of opium gum (2 percent decrease for the same period in CY 2019); 10,947 liters of  methamphetamine (50 percent increase for the same period in CY19);   $197.61\\;\\mathrm{kg}$   of heroin (43  percent decrease from the same period in CY19), 26 clandestine laboratories (6 fewer than the  same period of CY19); and  $200\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of fentanyl for the first three quarters of 2020.  \nSince Mexico does not have a reliable and centralized reporting system for eradication and  seizure data, the majority of drug seizures probably go underreported.  The United States  continues to work with the Government of Mexico to establish protocols for reporting all  seizures to Mexico’s central data repository for crime statistics in CENAPI to improve national  data collection on illicit drug seizures.  The Mexican government demonstrated progress in 2020  on measuring poppy cultivation, yield, and eradication through programs supported by the  United States through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  The Mexican  military engaged U.S. government agencies to enhance its counter drug capacity in 2020 and the  Army (SEDENA) has increased use of, but has not yet fully maximized, a U.S.-funded poppy  eradication verification program.  \nThe United States collaborates with FGR and the Mexican Navy (SEMAR) to increase their  ability to dismantle clandestine drug labs and to interdict precursor chemicals at seaports.  Since  June 2019, SEMAR’s Naval Intelligence Unit (UIN) has operated an air base refurbished with  U.S. support to conduct counter drug operations in Northwest Mexico.  In spite of these efforts,  illicit drug production in Mexico continues at an alarming level.    \nCanines donated by the United States to Mexico assisted in significant seizures of illicit drugs in  2020, including fentanyl and its precursors.  In the first 10 months of 2020, canines donated to  the National Guard, FGR, Mexican Customs (SAT), state police canine units and state prisons  units assisted in the collective seizure of   $11{,}773~\\mathrm{kg}$   of methamphetamine (compared to   $1{,}550\\,\\mathrm{kg}$    in 2019),   $199\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of fentanyl, 8.7 million U.S. dollars in cash, 5,227 illicit firearms (compared to  8,850 in 2019), and other contraband.  The United States sponsors exchanges and training on  combating synthetic drugs to promote awareness of the opioid crisis and increased seizures of  fentanyl and precursor chemicals in Mexico.      \n3.

Introduction\n\nNicaragua is a transit route for drug trafficking organizations smuggling cocaine from South\nAmerica through Mexico into the United States via maritime and air routes. The country’s long\ncoastlines, porous border crossings, and sparsely populated Caribbean region provide optimal\nconditions for transporting illicit drugs. Although the Government of Nicaragua publicly claims\nsuccesses against these organizations, its efforts remain under-resourced, without dedicated air\nassets, technical capacity, training, or accountability. Corruption and the diversion of\ngovernment resources to prosecute domestic political opposition reduced Nicaragua’s efforts to\neffectively combat drug trafficking in 2020.\n\nB. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends\n1. Institutional Development\n\nNicaragua’s Sovereign Security Law establishes narcotrafficking and international criminal\norganizations as threats to the nation’s security. The law outlines a plan called the Containment\nWall State Strategy, which is an interinstitutional approach comprised of land-based, air, and\nmaritime patrolling from bases at key border crossings and transit routes. Under this strategy,\nthe Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) and the Nicaraguan military are the primary institutions\nresponsible for combatting drug trafficking. Nicaragua’s limited interdiction capacity,\ninefficiency, and corruption remain the primary challenges to the Ortega administration’s ability\nto combat illegal trafficking.\n\nThe economic recession, which started in 2018 due to the country’s ongoing socio-political\ncrisis, worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Despite the economic downturn in\n2020, the budgets of the NNP and the Nicaraguan military have not decreased. Independent\nsecurity experts noted the government allocated considerable security resources to repress\nopposition groups while independent polling showed citizen concerns about rising insecurity are\nat the highest point in ten years. Most 2020 international assistance was directed to public health\ninitiatives and combating COVID; there were no reported donations to the NNP or the military to\ncombat drug trafficking.\n\nNicaraguan cooperation with U.S. law enforcement is limited. While the United States and\nNicaragua are parties to a bilateral extradition treaty, the Nicaraguan constitution bars the\nextradition of Nicaraguan nationals, which includes dual nationals. Nicaragua typically requires\nan International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) Red Notice for wanted individuals\nto cooperate with the United States in expelling non-Nicaraguan citizen fugitives or assuming\ndomestic jurisdiction in cases against Nicaraguan citizens.

Introduction \nNicaragua is a transit route for drug trafficking organizations smuggling cocaine from South  America through Mexico into the United States via maritime and air routes.  The country’s long  coastlines, porous border crossings, and sparsely populated Caribbean region provide optimal  conditions for transporting illicit drugs.  Although the Government of Nicaragua publicly claims  successes against these organizations, its efforts remain under-resourced, without dedicated air  assets, technical capacity, training, or accountability.  Corruption and the diversion of  government resources to prosecute domestic political opposition reduced Nicaragua’s efforts to  effectively combat drug trafficking in 2020.  \nB.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends \n1.  Institutional Development \nNicaragua’s Sovereign Security Law establishes n arco trafficking and international criminal  organizations as threats to the nation’s security.  The law outlines a plan called the Containment  Wall State Strategy, which is an inter institutional approach comprised of land-based, air, and  maritime patrolling from bases at key border crossings and transit routes.  Under this strategy,  the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) and the Nicaraguan military are the primary institutions  responsible for combatting drug trafficking.  Nicaragua’s limited interdiction capacity,  inefficiency, and corruption remain the primary challenges to the Ortega administration’s ability  to combat illegal trafficking.  \nThe economic recession, which started in 2018 due to the country’s ongoing socio-political  crisis, worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.  Despite the economic downturn in  2020, the budgets of the NNP and the Nicaraguan military have not decreased.  Independent  security experts noted the government allocated considerable security resources to repress  opposition groups while independent polling showed citizen concerns about rising insecurity are  at the highest point in ten years.  Most 2020 international assistance was directed to public health  initiatives and combating COVID; there were no reported donations to the NNP or the military to  combat drug trafficking.  \nNicaraguan cooperation with U.S. law enforcement is limited.  While the United States and  Nicaragua are parties to a bilateral extradition treaty, the Nicaraguan constitution bars the  extradition of Nicaraguan nationals, which includes dual nationals.  Nicaragua typically requires  an International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) Red Notice for wanted individuals  to cooperate with the United States in expelling non-Nicaraguan citizen fugitives or assuming  domestic jurisdiction in cases against Nicaraguan citizens.  There is no bilateral mutual legal  assistance treaty between the United States and Nicaragua, but both countries are parties to the  Inter American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.  Despite policy  restrictions on cooperation with the Government of Nicaragua, the NNP continues to provide  timely responses to requests for security assistance for mission operations and limited  coordination on criminal investigations and narcotics and currency trafficking interdiction.

Pakistan’s seaports, airports, postal\nservices, and unpatrolled coastal areas allow illicit drugs to be distributed globally. The United\nNations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates Pakistan is the transit country for 45\npercent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan. Precursor chemicals used to produce heroin and\nmethamphetamine also pass through Pakistan as a major transit point before global distribution.\n\nPakistan lacks the capacity to provide effective, non-residential substance abuse treatment and to\nincorporate a scientific approach to drug prevention education systematically. Opium poppy\ncultivation continues in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and the Newly Merged\nDistricts (NMDs) of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas.

Introduction  \nPakistan is one of the world’s top transit corridors for opiates and cannabis products, trafficked  through its porous borders with Afghanistan and Iran.  Pakistan’s seaports, airports, postal  services, and unpatrolled coastal areas allow illicit drugs to be distributed globally.  The United  Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates Pakistan is the transit country for 45  percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan.  Precursor chemicals used to produce heroin and  methamphetamine also pass through Pakistan as a major transit point before global distribution.    \nPakistan lacks the capacity to provide effective, non-residential substance abuse treatment and to  incorporate a scientific approach to drug prevention education systematically.  Opium poppy  cultivation continues in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and the Newly Merged  Districts (NMDs) of the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas.  Government officials  publicly deny poppy cultivation exists in Pakistan but express a commitment to drug prevention  and narcotics interdiction.  \nB.

Corruption  \nPanama does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production  or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs, and within  the current administration no senior government officials have been identified as being engaged  in such activity.  Political factions associated with ex-Presidents Martinelli (2009-2014) and  Varela (2014-2109) were alleged to be involved in corrupt activity, and respected international  organizations have expressed alarm that corruption in Panama persistently worsened from 2015– 2019.  Although Panama’s security forces have made progress over the past decade in reducing  corruption, the country’s judicial system remains ineffective in prosecuting powerful individuals.  \nC.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  \nThe United States provides assistance to Panama through the Central America Regional Security  Initiative.  Panama shares U.S. national security goals, including dismantling transnational  criminal organizations.  The annual bilateral High-Level Strategic Dialogue occurred in  December 2020, with an agenda featuring joint projects to combat narcotics trafficking and  TCOs.        \nIn a major accomplishment for Panama, the Panamanian government will launch a new Joint  Maritime Force in January 2021 with U.S. support.  Panama and the United States also agreed to  develop a Joint Regional Air and Navy Operations Center, which will direct, monitor, and  execute tactical level command and control of maritime law enforcement operations, including  counter narcotics operations, search and rescue at sea, and illegal fishing operations, utilizing the  Joint Maritime Force throughout Panama’s national waters.    \nThe United States invested in several maritime security initiatives to support the three security  services’ counter narcotics missions, including boats, boat and pier repairs, and support for  Panama’s purchase of a 200-ton capacity mobile boat hoist.  The creation of the Joint Maritime  Force will optimize and increase interdiction capacity and seizure rates, while improving  efficiencies, reducing costs, and eliminating duplication of missions.    \nCooperation between the two countries resulted in the arrest and extradition to the United States  of top leaders of the Colombia-based Clan del Golfo drug cartel in Panama in 2020.  At the  request of Panamanian authorities, the United States helped Panama develop a “Case Package” -  a standardized presentation of evidence for maritime interdictions based on the U.S. Coast Guard  model – which Panamanian security forces and courts started using in January 2020.  The United  States also expanded its training programs for prosecutors, judges, and police.  \nPanama is a regular participant in the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, which brings  together over 150 maritime counter drug professionals from North, Central, and South America  and Europe.

PADS implementation has, however, been hindered by limitations  brought about by the global health crisis.    \nChanges in the leadership of two key law enforcement agencies took place during the reporting  period, with both leaders setting a strong anti-drug posture from the start.  President Duterte  appointed a new Philippine National Police (PNP) Chief – General Debold Sina – who  emphasized he plans to continue President Duterte’s drug war.  The Philippine Drug  Enforcement Agency (PDEA) has a new Director General – Wilkins Villanueva – who is  working to strengthen the Barangay Drug Clearing Program (BDCP), which aims to make all  barangays (neighborhoods) drug free by 2022 through preventive education, community  involvement and law enforcement engagement.

The KPS Narcotics Brigade investigates\nand arrests individuals involved in trafficking illicit drugs.

Santokhi\nserved as Minister of Justice and Police from 2005-2010 in Ronald Venetiaan’s third\nadministration.

Suriname’s sparsely populated coastal region and isolated  jungle interior, together with weak border controls and infrastructure, make illicit drug detection  and interdiction efforts difficult.  \nB.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  \n1.  Institutional Development  \nThe Government of Suriname is officially opposed to illicit drug trafficking, but Suriname’s  practical ability to apprehend and prosecute drug traffickers remains inhibited by drug-related  corruption, bureaucratic hurdles, and the lack of financial and material resources.  The Suriname  Police Force (KPS) is responsible for the detection and combating of drug-related activities with  four units having specific drug control responsibilities.  The KPS Narcotics Brigade investigates  and arrests individuals involved in trafficking illicit drugs.  At the airport, the Combating  International Drug Trafficking Unit (BID) screens airport passengers on outbound flights.  Assisting the BID team is the canine unit (Honden Brigade) for inspecting luggage.  \nThe Container Control Unit (CCP) is the fourth unit with specific drug control responsibilities.  It  uses risk analysis and other proactive techniques to systematically target high-risk containers.  The Unit’s operating protocol requires permission and oversight of Surinamese Customs  authorities during inspections.   \nIn July 2020, Chandrikapersad Santokhi was inaugurated as President of Suriname.  Santokhi  served as Minister of Justice and Police from 2005-2010 in Ronald Venetiaan’s third  administration.  His leadership of the Ministry was characterized as employing a get-tough  approach to crime, particularly with respect to drug trafficking.  Santokhi also served 15 years on  the Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, including as Vice Chair in 2009-2010 and  as Chair in 2010-2011.   \nSuriname’s new government has committed to enforcing the rule of law and expanding law  enforcement cooperation with international partners.  In his July 2020 inaugural remarks,  President Santokhi pledged “to change Suriname’s image as a drug transit country.”  In his first  annual State of the Republic address in September 2020, he committed his government to  strengthening Suriname’s Narcotics Brigade.  In September 2020, Secretary of State Pompeo  visited Suriname, where he met with President Santokhi and a number of cabinet ministers.  Santokhi’s Minister of Justice and Police told local media that cooperation on counter narcotics  was a theme of their discussions with the Secretary, and the minister indicated that Suriname  wished to strengthen its ties with U.S. law enforcement.  In October 2020, Suriname’s Attorney  General called for intensified international cooperation on counter narcotics, referring specifically  to this possibility for enhanced ties with the United States.
