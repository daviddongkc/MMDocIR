This indicates that almost three quarters of your paid\nsearch is not bringing in new prospects — it is simply delivering people who are already actively\nlooking for you and who have previously been exposed to some other form of advertising or\nmarketing.\n\n* Approximately 44% of people who have clicked on a Paid Search Ad have been previously exposed\nto a banner ad. But, the banner ad gets no performance attribution at all because the prospect\ndidn’t click on it and in most cases the marketer or agency uses the Last Click to determine what\nworked — in this case paid search. (For the record, my peers and | stopped using CTR — click through\nrate — on banner ads some 4 years ago because it is not the right performance metric for the\ndisplay advertising medium).\n\nNow, there is no magic technical bullet here and if any vendor comes to you and say they do, start\nrunning in the opposite direction.
