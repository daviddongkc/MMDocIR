As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of  Directors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance  the Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the  Company submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the  Company’s compliance and operational risk management  program. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the  Company works to address the consent order provisions. The  consent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s  acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s  adoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial  third-party review of the enhancements and improvements  provided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete  and the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction  of the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined  under the consent order will be limited to the level as of  December 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured  on a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of  temporary fluctuations. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on  April 8, 2020, the FRB amended the consent order to allow the  Company to exclude from the asset cap any on-balance sheet  exposure resulting from loans made by the Company in  connection with the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck  Protection Program and the FRB’s Main Street Lending Program.  As required under the amendment to the consent order, to the  extent the Company chooses to exclude these exposures from  the asset cap, certain fees and other economic benefits received  by the Company from loans made in connection with these  programs shall be transferred to the U.S. Treasury or to nonprofit  organizations approved by the FRB that support small  businesses. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had not  excluded these exposures from the asset cap. After removal of  the asset cap, a second third-party review must also be  conducted to assess the efficacy and sustainability of the  enhancements and improvements.

As required by the consent orders, the  Company submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide  compliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the  Company’s internal audit program with respect to federal  consumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In  addition, as required by the consent orders, the Company  submitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers  affected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and  mortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the  management of remediation activities conducted by the  Company. The Company continues to work to address the  provisions of the consent orders.

The methodology of determining tangible common equity may   differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity, which utilizes tangible common equity, is a useful financial measure because it enables management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial  measures, see the “Capital Management – Tangible Common Equity” section in this Report.

In response to the regulators’ guidance and to  facilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28,  2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended  and restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with  WFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and  subsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo  Securities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC  (“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated  from time to time as material entities for resolution planning  purposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time  as related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related  Support Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the  Parent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including  the majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and  intercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its  subsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will  continue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time  to time.

If certain liquidity and/   or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s  board of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the  committed line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to  pay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which  could materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and  its ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could  result in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the  Parent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if  the Support Agreement were not implemented.

Regulatory Developments Related to COVID-19.  In response  to the COVID-19 pandemic and related events, federal  banking regulators undertook a number of measures to help   stabilize the banking sector, support the broader economy,  and facilitate the ability of banking organizations like  Wells Fargo to continue lending to consumers and  businesses. For example, in order to facilitate the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES  Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to  encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus  measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s  Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a  number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity  and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering  money market mutual funds and term asset-backed  securities loans. Certain of these measures, including the  acceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection  Program and the extension of credit under certain FRB  lending facilities, ended in 2021. Federal banking regulators  also issued rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC  rules and other prudential regulations to temporarily ease  certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage  the use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to  further promote lending to consumers and businesses.   In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for  banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected  by the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect  to waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, and  providing payment deferrals.

Management exercises  judgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios  that are used to estimate future credit losses.  \n\n •   Reversion to historical loss expectations.  Our long-term  average loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the   long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the  forecasted economic variables. These long-term averages  are based on observations over multiple economic cycles.  The reversion period, which may be up to two years, is  assessed on a quarterly basis. \n\n •   Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans,  unfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.  Individually   assessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit  variables in our modeled approaches to help assess  probability of default and loss given default. Borrower  quality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial  strength and contribute to forecasted probability of default  curves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted  collateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted  severity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk  ratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers  and subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk  specialists.  \n\n •   Usage of credit loss estimation models.  We use internally  developed models that incorporate credit attributes and  economic variables to generate estimates of credit losses.

We apply  judgment when valuing the collateral either through  appraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or  other quantitative techniques.

As a large financial institution that serves customers through  numerous physical locations, ATMs, the internet, mobile banking  and other distribution channels across the U.S. and  internationally, we depend on our ability to process, record and  monitor a large number of customer transactions on a  continuous basis. As our customer base and locations have  expanded throughout the U.S. and internationally, as we have  increasingly used the internet and mobile banking to provide  products and services to our customers, as customer, public,  legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and  information security have increased, and as cyber and other  information security attacks have become more prevalent and  complex, our operational systems, controls and infrastructure  must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential  failures, disruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial,  accounting, data processing systems or other operating systems  and facilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient  based on our evolving business needs, or become disabled or  damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that  are wholly or partially beyond our control. For example, there  have been and could in the future be sudden increases in  customer transaction volume; electrical or telecommunications  outages; degradation or loss of internet, website or mobile  banking availability; natural disasters such as earthquakes,  tornados, and hurricanes; disease pandemics; events arising from  local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist  acts; and, as described below, cyber attacks or other information  security breaches. Furthermore, enhancements and upgrades to  our infrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming,  entail significant costs, and create risks associated with  implementing new systems and integrating them with existing  ones.

For example, Wells Fargo and other  financial institutions, as well as their third-party service  providers, continue to be the target of various evolving and  adaptive cyber attacks, including malware, ransomware, other  malicious software intended to exploit hardware or software  vulnerabilities, phishing, credential validation, and distributed  denial-of-service, in an effort to disrupt the operations of  financial institutions, test their cybersecurity capabilities, commit  fraud, or obtain confidential, proprietary or other information.  Cyber attacks have also focused on targeting online applications  and services, such as online banking, as well as cloud-based and  other products and services provided by third parties, and have  targeted the infrastructure of the internet, causing the  widespread unavailability of websites and degrading website  performance. As a result, information security and the continued  development and enhancement of our controls, processes and  systems designed to protect our networks, computers, software  and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a  priority for Wells Fargo.

Multiple putative class actions alleging, among  other things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI  policies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into  one multi-district litigation in the United States District Court  for the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the  Company entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district  litigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class  action against the Company and its executive officers alleging  material misstatements and omissions of CPI-related  information in the Company’s public disclosures. In January 2020,  the court dismissed this action as to all defendants except the  Company and a former executive officer and limited the action to  two alleged misstatements. In addition, the Company is subject  to a class action in the United States District Court for the  Central District of California alleging that customers are entitled  to refunds related to the unused portion of guaranteed  automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance agreements  between the customer and dealer and, by assignment, the lender.  In November 2021, the court granted final approval of an  agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay   $\\S45$   million and make certain changes to its GAP refund practices  in order to settle the action. Allegations related to the CPI and  GAP programs were among the subjects of a shareholder  derivative lawsuit in the United States District Court for the  Northern District of California, which has been dismissed. In  addition, federal and state government agencies, including the  CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries,  investigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues  related to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer  auto loans, including related insurance products. As previously  disclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve  investigations by state attorneys general.

Visa,  MasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding  companies are also named as defendants in these actions. These  actions have been consolidated in the United States District  Court for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and  consolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based  on alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks  damages, as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege  that Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully  colluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that  enforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged  tying and bundling of services offered to merchants are  anticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other  defendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment  Sharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other  entities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the  Interchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and  the financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed  a memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to  resolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate  settlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The  settlement payments to be made by all defendants in the  consolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately   $\\S6.6$   billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants  opting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided  for the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of  default interchange across all credit rate categories for a period  of eight consecutive months. The district court granted final  approval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United  States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement  objector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the  settlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On  June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement  agreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action  to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of  New York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior  class counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court,  seeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second  Circuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27,  2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead  class counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class.  The parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve  the money damages class claims pursuant to which defendants  will pay a total of approximately  $\\S6.2$   billion, which includes  approximately  $\\S5.3$   billion of funds remaining from the 2012  settlement and   $\\S900$   million in additional funding.

The discount rate consists   of a benchmark rate component and a risk premium  component. The benchmark rate component, for example,   OIS, London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or U.S.  Treasury rates, is generally observable within the market   and is necessary to appropriately reflect the time value of  money.

The Basel III capital requirements for  calculating Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along  with RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the requirements for  determining tier 2 and total capital remained in accordance with  transition requirements at December 31, 2021, but became fully  phased-in beginning January 1, 2022. Accordingly, the  information presented below reflects fully phased-in CET1  capital, tier 1 capital, and RWAs, but reflects total capital still in  accordance with transition requirements.
