The climate  accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging.  Our Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of Nationally  Determined Contributions (NDCs), which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies, which often  target specific sectors. It estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by using various assumptions and  tools – including, depending on the sector, application of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive  fuel economy standards).

This process is aligned with the requirements of ASC 360 and ASC 932, and relies in part on the Corporation’s planning and  budgeting cycle. In 2020, the Corporation identified a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that  the carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Those situations primarily related to the annual review and  approval of the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio to  prioritize assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize resources  within current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort included a  re-assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation’s future  development plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry gas  portfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas  regions of the U.S., as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non- cash, before-tax charges of   $\\S24.4$   billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other before-tax  impairment charges in 2020 included  $\\S0.9$   billion in Upstream,  $\\S0.5$   billion in Downstream, and  $\\S0.1$   billion in Chemical.

The Contractors are in dispute with NNPC regarding NNPC's lifting of crude  oil in excess of its entitlement under the terms of the PSC. In accordance with the terms of the PSC, the Contractors initiated  arbitration in Abuja, Nigeria, under the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. On October 24, 2011, a three-member arbitral  Tribunal issued an award upholding the Contractors' position in all material respects and awarding damages to the Contractors jointly  in an amount of approximately   $\\S1.8$   billion plus   $\\S234$   million in accrued interest. The Contractors petitioned a Nigerian federal court  for enforcement of the award, and NNPC petitioned the same court to have the award set aside. On May 22, 2012, the court set aside  the award. The Contractors appealed that judgment to the Court of Appeal, Abuja Judicial Division. On July 22, 2016, the Court of  Appeal upheld the decision of the lower court setting aside the award. On October 21, 2016, the Contractors appealed the decision to  the Supreme Court of Nigeria. In June 2013, the Contractors filed a lawsuit against NNPC in the Nigerian federal high court in order  to preserve their ability to seek enforcement of the PSC in the courts if necessary. Following dismissal by this court, the Contractors  appealed to the Nigerian Court of Appeal in June 2016. In October 2014, the Contractors filed suit in the United States District Court  for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) to enforce, if necessary, the arbitration award against NNPC assets residing within that  jurisdiction.
