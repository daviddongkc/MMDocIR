The Tax Administration serves as the official tax authority in Iran, overseeing  direct and most indirect taxes.  Direct taxes include property taxes (such as inheritance taxes and  stamp duties),  and income taxes (such as property, agricultural, salary, self-employment, and  corporate income taxes). Indirect taxes encompass Value Added Tax (VAT) and import taxes. The core legislation governing direct taxation is the Direct Taxes Act, adopted in 1987 and last  amended in 2015, which is aimed at supporting production and investment promotion in line  with the country’s economic development, particularly for newly established manufacturing and  mineral units and investment promotion.   The Value Added Tax Act (VATA), approved in 2008,  and revised in 2021,  plays a crucial role in the indirect tax framework. The Foreign Investment  Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA), passed in 2002,  provides government-backed investment  insurance for foreign investors and an equal investment tax and incentives for Iranian nationals.  Individuals and entities subject to taxation in Iran are (1) owners, both real and legal persons, in  relation to their personal and real estate in Iran; (2) Iranian individuals residing in Iran, on all  their income earned in Iran or abroad; (3) Iranian individuals residing abroad, on all their income  derived in Iran; (4) Iranian legal persons (companies, organizations, etc.) on all their profits  earned in Iran or abroad; and (5) non-Iranian individuals and entities on income or profits derived  from activities in Iran, including licensing, rights provision, training, technical assistance, and the  transfer of cinematographic films.
