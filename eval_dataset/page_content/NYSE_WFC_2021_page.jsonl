In May  2021, we issued our frst sustainability bond,  raising  ${\\sf S1}$   billion in capital to support housing  afordability, socioeconomic advancement  and empowerment, and renewable energy.  We expect to announce our first interim  fnanced emissions targets for the oil and  gas, and power sectors later this year.  \nThis work is bigger than any one company,  and we will work across companies and industries  as we progress. In the fourth quarter of 2021,  we joined the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, an  industry-led leadership group designed to foster  collaboration and support banks in aligning their  fnancing with the goal of achieving net-zero  greenhouse gas emissions.  \nFinally, we recognize that afordable housing  continues to be one of the top needs in our  country. As a company, we use our resources  to support afordable, multifamily housing  in the U.S., in addition to acting as an active  lender for affordable rental housing  developments. We remain committed to  supporting our customers with homeownership.  In 2021, we helped over 585,000 homeowners  with new low-rate loans to either purchase  a home or refinance an existing mortgage.  We also closed  $\\mathsf{S}2.2$   billion in new commitments  for afordable housing under the government- sponsored enterprise (GSE) and Federal Housing  Administration (FHA) programs. As part of our  Neighborhood LIFT program, we committed to  invest  $\\mathsf{S}5$   million to help more than 300 low-   and moderate-income residents in Houston  with home down payment assistance.

Central banks in various jurisdictions\nconvened committees to identify replacement rates to facilitate\nthe transition away from LIBOR. The committee convened by the\nFederal Reserve in the United States, the Alternative Reference\nRates Committee (ARRC), recommended the Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) as the replacement rate for USD LIBOR.\nAdditionally, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have issued guidance\nstrongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using USD\nLIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts.\n\nIn preparation for the cessation of the various LIBOR\nsettings, we have undertaken a variety of activities. Among other\nthings, we proactively implemented internal “stop-sell” dates to\ndiscontinue offering products referencing LIBOR except\npursuant to limited exceptions consistent with regulatory\nguidance. At the same time, we expanded our suite of product\nofferings that are indexed to alternative reference rates.\n\nWe also continue to transition our legacy LIBOR contracts to\nalternative reference rates. We transitioned substantially all of\nour legacy contracts with LIBOR settings impacted by the\nDecember 31, 2021, cessation date to alternative reference\nrates, and we will continue to address contracts with LIBOR\nsettings that are impacted by the June 30, 2023, cessation date.\n« For USD LIBOR contracts that mature before June 30, 2023,\nthose contracts that are renewed or replaced will be indexed\nto alternative reference rates.\n« At December 31, 2021, the notional amount of our\nderivatives indexed to USD LIBOR, including bilateral\ncontracts that mature after June 30, 2023, and centrally-\ncleared contracts that mature either before or after June 30,\n2023, was over $6 trillion. We expect substantially all of\nthese contracts to transition to SOFR either prior to or\nmmediately after June 30, 2023, in accordance with existing\nfallback provisions.\n\nt December 31, 2021, we had over $350 billion of USD\n\nBOR commercial credit facilities that mature after June 30,\n\n023.

On November 1, 2021, we  closed the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and  WFAM.  \nIn second quarter 2021, we elected to change our  accounting method for low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)  investments and elected to change the presentation of  investment tax credits related to solar energy investments.  These accounting policy changes had a nominal impact on  reportable operating segment results. Prior period financial  statement line items for the Company, as well as for the  reportable operating segments, have been revised to conform  with the current period presentation. Our LIHTC investments are  included in the Corporate and Investment Banking operating  segment and our solar energy investments are included in the  Commercial Banking operating segment. For additional  information, see the “Overview – Recent Developments” section  and Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to  Financial Statements in this Report.   \nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds  transfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk,  liquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating  segments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a  funding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in  net interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or  credits is recognized in corporate treasury.   \nRevenue and Expense Sharing   When lines of business jointly  serve customers, the line of business that is responsible for  providing the product or service recognizes revenue or expense  with a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of  business based on established internal revenue-sharing  agreements.   \nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another  line of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate),  expense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the  service provided.   \nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent  adjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and  debt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable- equivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low- income housing and renewable energy investments are included  in noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts  to income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in  Corporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment  Banking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s  consolidated financial results.   \nAllocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated  capital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based  on aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the  assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are  periodically assessed and revised. Management believes that  return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure because it  enables management, investors, and others to assess a  reportable operating segment’s use of capital.  \nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial  metrics that management uses when evaluating reportable  operating segment results. Management believes that these  metrics are useful to investors and others to assess the  performance, customer growth, and trends of reportable  operating segments or lines of business.   \nThe table depicts the organizational structure of Wells Fargo & Company, divided into five primary segments. Each segment includes a list of specific services or functions:\n\n1. **Consumer Banking and Lending**:\n   - Consumer and Small Business Banking\n   - Home Lending\n   - Credit Card\n   - Auto\n   - Personal Lending\n\n2. **Commercial Banking**:\n   - Middle Market Banking\n   - Asset-Based Lending and Leasing\n\n3. **Corporate and Investment Banking**:\n   - Banking\n   - Commercial Real Estate\n   - Markets\n\n4. **Wealth and Investment Management**:\n   - Wells Fargo Advisors\n   - The Private Bank\n\n5. **Corporate**:\n   - Corporate Treasury\n   - Enterprise Functions\n   - Investment Portfolio\n   - Affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses\n   - Non-strategic businesses\n\nThis table highlights the various services and business functions operated by Wells Fargo & Company in different sectors."}

Here are the key components:\n\n### Income Statement (in $ millions)\n- **Net Interest Income:** $7,410\n- **Noninterest Income:** $6,429 (includes deposit-related fees, lending-related fees, investment banking fees, net gains from trading activities, and other)\n- **Total Revenue:** $13,839\n- **Net Charge-offs:** $(22)\n- **Provision for Credit Losses:** $(1,439)\n- **Noninterest Expense:** $7,200\n- **Income Before Income Tax Expense:** $8,078\n- **Income Tax Expense:** $2,019\n- **Net Income:** $6,062\n\n### Revenue by Line of Business (in $ millions)\n- **Banking:**\n  - Lending: $1,948\n  - Treasury Management and Payments: $1,468\n  - Investment Banking: $1,654\n- **Commercial Real Estate:** $3,963\n- **Markets (FICC, Equities, Credit Adjustment):** $4,698\n- **Other:** $108\n\n### Selected Metrics\n- **Return on Allocated Capital:** 16.9%\n- **Efficiency Ratio:** 52\n- **Headcount (period-end):** 8,489\n\nThe table also includes changes from previous years in percentage and absolute terms.\nFull year 2021 vs. full year 2020 \nRevenue   decreased driven by: \n  lower net gains from trading activities driven by lower  volumes of interest rate products, lower client trading  activity for equity products due to market volatility in 2020,  and lower client trading activity for credit products  reflecting greater market liquidity in 2020 from government actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,   partially offset by higher client trading activity for asset- backed finance products;   \npartially offset by: \n•   higher investment banking fees due to higher debt  underwriting fees, including loan syndication fees, as well as  higher advisory fees and equity underwriting fees;  \n\n •   higher other noninterest income driven by higher  commercial mortgage banking income due to higher  servicing income and gains on the sales of mortgage loans,  as well as higher income from low-income housing  investments; and  \n\n •   higher lending-related fees reflecting increased loan   commitment fees.

The AFS debt securities\nportfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the\nnormal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in\nour interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall\neconomic or market conditions, which could influence loan\norigination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances and\nmix.

The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S.\nstates and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Our\nintent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the\ncontractual cash flows.

The size and composition of our AFS and HTM debt  securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity and interest  rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt securities  portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise in the  normal course of business or due to market stress. Changes in  our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes in overall  economic or market conditions, which could influence loan  origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances and  mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be  rebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk  management objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and  interest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt securities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other  short-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability  Management” section in this Report for additional information  on liquidity and interest rate risk.  \nThe AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of  liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and  agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S.  states and political subdivisions and highly rated collateralized  loan obligations (CLOs).  \nThe amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of  AFS and HTM debt securities increased from December 31,  2020. We continued to purchase AFS and HTM debt securities,  including HTM debt securities through securitizations of LHFS,  which more than offset portfolio runoff and AFS debt security  sales. In addition, we transferred  $\\S56.0$   billion of AFS debt  securities to HTM debt securities in 2021 due to actions taken to  reposition the overall portfolio for capital management  purposes.   \nThe total net unrealized gains on AFS and HTM debt  securities decreased from December 31, 2020, driven by higher  interest rates.  \nAt December 31, 2021,  $98\\%$   of the combined AFS and HTM  debt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above. Ratings are  based on external ratings where available and, where not  available, based on internal credit grades. See Note 3 (Available­ for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial  Statements in this Report for additional information on AFS and  HTM debt securities, including a summary of debt securities by  security type.  \nThe HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of  liquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and  agency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S.  states and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Our  intent is to hold these securities to maturity and collect the  contractual cash flows.

We do not offer option ARM products,  nor do we offer variable-rate mortgage products with fixed  payment amounts, commonly referred to within the financial  services industry as negative amortizing mortgage loans.  \nThe residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio consists of  residential mortgage lines of credit and loans that are  subordinate in rights to an existing lien on the same property.  These lines and loans may have draw periods, interest-only  \npayments, balloon payments, adjustable rates and similar  features. Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing  payment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods  between five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit  performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio  for trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity  of losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan  is delinquent.   \nOur residential mortgage lines of credit (both first and junior  lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 or 20 years with  variable interest rate and payment options available during the  draw period of (1) interest-only or (2)  $1.5\\%$   of outstanding  principal balance plus accrued interest. As of December 31, 2021,  lines of credit in a draw period primarily used the interest-only  option. The lines that enter their amortization period may  experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than the  ones in their draw or term period. We have considered this  increased risk in our ACL estimate.   \nDuring the draw period, the borrower has the option of  converting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate  to a fixed rate with terms including interest-only payments for a  fixed period between three to seven years or a fully amortizing  payment with a fixed period between five to 30 years. At the end  of the draw period, a line of credit generally converts to an  amortizing payment schedule with repayment terms of up to  30 years based on the balance at time of conversion. Certain lines  and loans have been structured with a balloon payment, which  requires full repayment of the outstanding balance at the end of  the term period. The conversion of lines or loans to fully  amortizing or balloon payoff may result in a significant payment  increase, which can affect some borrowers’ ability to repay the  outstanding balance.   "}

When we  delay the timing on the repayment of a portion of principal  (principal forbearance), we charge off the amount of forbearance  if that amount is not considered fully collectible. The allowance  for loan losses for TDRs was  $\\mathbb{S}2\\mathbb{1}\\mathbb{1}$   million and  $\\S565$   million at  December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  \nOur nonaccrual policies are generally the same for all   loan types when a restructuring is involved. We may   re-underwrite loans at the time of restructuring to determine  whether there is sufficient evidence of sustained repayment  capacity based on the borrower’s documented income, debt   to income ratios, and other factors. Loans that are not re- underwritten or loans that lack sufficient evidence of sustained  repayment capacity at the time of modification are charged  down to the fair value of the collateral, if applicable. For an  accruing loan that has been modified, if the borrower has  demonstrated performance under the previous terms and the  underwriting process shows the capacity to continue to perform  under the restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in  accruing status. Otherwise, the loan will be placed in nonaccrual  status and may be returned to accruing status when the  borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance,  generally six consecutive months of payments, or equivalent,  inclusive of consecutive payments made prior to modification.  Loans will also be placed on nonaccrual status, and a  corresponding charge-off is recorded to the loan balance, when  we believe that principal and interest contractually due under the  modified agreement will not be collectible.

The COVID-19\npandemic could continue to impact the recognition of credit\nosses in our loan portfolios and may result in increases or\ndecreases in our ACL.\n\nWe believe the ACL for loans of $13.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit\nosses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The\nentire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total\noan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects\nexisting factors as of the date of determination, including\neconomic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external\nexamination processes.

In\naddition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential\nmortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed\nby the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We\n\nmay be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify\nthe securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the\nsecuritization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred\non loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of\ncontractual representations or warranties that is not remedied\nwithin a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of\nthe breach.\n\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential\nmortgage loans to various parties, we have established a\nmortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to\nvarious representations and warranties that reflect\nmanagement’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could\nhave a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service\nthose loans, based on a combination of factors. See Note 8\n‘Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial\nStatements in this Report for additional information about our\niability for mortgage loan repurchase losses.\n\nWe provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage\nloans sold under various programs and arrangements.

There remains uncertainty related to  the length and severity of the economic impact of the COVID-19  pandemic, including the possibility of additional variants, and the  impact of other factors that may influence the level of expected  losses and associated amounts of the ACL. The COVID-19  pandemic could continue to impact the recognition of credit  losses in our loan portfolios and may result in increases or  decreases in our ACL.   \nWe believe the ACL for loans of  $\\S13.8$   billion at  December 31, 2021, was appropriate to cover expected credit  losses, including unfunded credit commitments, at that date. The  entire allowance is available to absorb credit losses from the total  loan portfolio. The ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects  existing factors as of the date of determination, including  economic or market conditions and ongoing internal and external  examination processes. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for  loans to changes in the economic and business environment, it is  possible that we will incur incremental credit losses not  anticipated as of the balance sheet date. Our process for  determining the ACL is discussed in the “Critical Accounting  Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” section and Note 1  (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to Financial  Statements in this Report.   \nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES   We sell residential and  commercial mortgage loans to various parties, including (1)  government-sponsored entities (GSEs) Federal Home Loan  Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal National Mortgage  Association (FNMA) who include the mortgage loans in GSE- guaranteed mortgage securitizations, (2) SPEs that issue private  label MBS, and (3) other financial institutions that purchase  mortgage loans for investment or private label securitization. In  addition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential  mortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed  by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We  may be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify  the securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the  securitization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred  on loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of  contractual representations or warranties that is not remedied  within a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of  the breach.   \n\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential  mortgage loans to various parties, we have established a  mortgage repurchase liability, initially at fair value, related to  various representations and warranties that reflect  management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we could  have a repurchase obligation, whether or not we currently service  those loans, based on a combination of factors.

These simulations require  assumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet  composition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans  and debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing  strategies.   \nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 30,  estimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months  using instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both  lower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario.  Steeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in  the yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors  three years and longer (e.g., 10-year U.S. Treasury securities) and  short-term interest rates defined as all tenors less than three  years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar interest rates are floored at   $0.00\\%$  . The following describes the simulation assumptions for  the scenarios presented in Table 30:  \n\n \n•   Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to   our assets and liabilities.  \n\n •   Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated  with the changes in interest rates are held constant.  \n\n •   Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary  across scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or   lower interest rates.  \n\n •   Our base scenario deposit forecast incorporates mix changes consistent with the base interest rate trajectory.

For the\nsimulations with downward shifts in interest rates, the 0.00%\ninterest rate floor limits the amount of the decline in net interest\nincome. We may have a larger decline in net interest income\nwhen interest rates increase for the base scenario relative to the\ninterest rate floor.\n\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive\nnoninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by\nmortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite\ndirection of our net interest income. Mortgage originations\ngenerally decline in response to higher interest rates and\ngenerally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly\nrefinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted\nby the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the\n“Risk Management — Asset/Liability Management — Mortgage\nBanking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for\nadditional information.\n\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from\nchanges in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that\nreduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally,\nour trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic\nhedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than\nthe related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income\nfrom the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest\nrates rise and fall, respectively.

We use derivatives for asset/liability management in\ntwo main ways:\n\n* to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability\ninstruments/portfolios including investments, commercial\nloans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to\nfloating-rate payments, or vice versa; and\n\n* to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline,\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs.\n\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to\nvarious risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.\nBased on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit\nand liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We\ndetermine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or\nheld for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our\nintent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our\ncorporate asset/liability management activities. We may also\nretain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we\nsecuritize mortgage loans.\n\nWe typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as\nheld for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage\nloans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of\nour agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment and\nnon-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for\nsale in support of future issuances of private label residential\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued $2.2 billion and\n$2.6 billion of RMBS in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nInterest rate and market risk can be substantial in our\nmortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact\norigination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential\nMSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate\n“locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the\nassociated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest\nincome, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges\nof MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior\nto fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required\nfor processing a new application, providing the commitment, and\nsecuritizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will\ngenerally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income ona\nlagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest\nrates.\n\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management\nabout matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical\nAccounting Policies — Valuation of Residential Mortgage\nServicing Rights” section in this Report for additional\ninformation. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of\nsignificant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of\nresidential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns\nand potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to\nservice, the value of escrow balances and other servicing\nvaluation elements. For additional information on mortgage\nbanking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity\nof the fair value of MSRs, see Note 9 (Mortgage Banking\nActivities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the\nservicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair\nvalue of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also\nreduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest\nincome from origination activities. A decline in interest rates\nwould generally have an opposite impact.\n\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of\nderivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar\nfutures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest\nrate options. MSR hedging results include a combination of\ndirectional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry\n\n50 Wells Fargo & Company\n", "vlm_text": "The table shows the impact of changes in interest rates on a specific financial metric, measured in billions of dollars, for the dates December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.

Our interest rate sensitive  noninterest income and expense are predominantly driven by  mortgage banking activities, and may move in the opposite  direction of our net interest income. Mortgage originations  generally decline in response to higher interest rates and  generally increase in response to lower interest rates, particularly  refinancing activity. Mortgage banking results are also impacted  by the valuation of MSRs and related hedge positions. See the  “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage  Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section in this Report for  additional information.   \nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income also results from  changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits that  reduce treasury management deposit service fees. Additionally,  our trading assets are (before the effects of certain economic  hedges) generally less sensitive to changes in interest rates than  the related funding liabilities. As a result, net interest income  from the trading portfolio contracts and expands as interest  rates rise and fall, respectively. The impact to net interest income  does not include the fair value changes of trading securities,  which, along with the effects of related economic hedges, are  recorded in noninterest income. For additional information on  our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 (Trading Activities)  to Financial Statements in this Report.   \nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded  and over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage  our interest rate exposures. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant  Accounting Policies), and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to- Maturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report   for additional information on the use of the debt securities  portfolios. The notional or contractual amount, credit risk  amount and fair value of the derivatives used to hedge our  interest rate risk exposures as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,  are presented in Note 16 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in  this Report. We use derivatives for asset/liability management in  two main ways:   \n  to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability instruments/portfolios including investments, commercial  loans and long-term debt, from fixed-rate payments to  floating-rate payments, or vice versa; and   \n•   to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and MSRs.   \nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK   We  \noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to  various risks, including credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.  Based on market conditions and other factors, we reduce credit  and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing mortgage loans. We  determine whether mortgage loans will be held for investment or  held for sale at the time of commitment, but may change our  intent to hold loans for investment or sale as part of our  corporate asset/liability management activities. We may also  retain securities in our investment portfolio at the time we  securitize mortgage loans.   \nWe typically originate agency residential mortgage loans as  held for sale and certain prime non-agency residential mortgage  loans as held for investment. Occasionally, we designate some of  our agency residential mortgage loans as held for investment and  non-agency residential mortgage loan originations as held for  sale in support of future issuances of private label residential  mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We issued  $\\S2.2$   billion and   $\\S2.6$   billion of RMBS in 2021 and   2020, respectively.   \nInterest rate and market risk can be substantial in our  mortgage businesses. Changes in interest rates may impact  origination and servicing fees, the fair value of our residential  MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan commitments (interest rate  “locks”) extended to mortgage applicants, as well as the  associated income or loss in mortgage banking noninterest  income, including the gains or losses related to economic hedges  of MSRs and LHFS. Given the time it takes for customer behavior  to fully react to interest rate changes, as well as the time required  for processing a new application, providing the commitment, and  securitizing and selling the loan, interest rate changes will  generally affect our mortgage banking noninterest income on a  lagging basis. The amount and timing of the impact will depend  on the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest  rates.   \nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly  subjective and involve complex judgments by management  about matters that are inherently unpredictable. See the “Critical  Accounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage  Servicing Rights” section in this Report for additional  information. Changes in interest rates influence a variety of  significant assumptions included in the periodic valuation of  residential MSRs, including prepayment rates, expected returns  and potential risks on the servicing asset portfolio, costs to  service, the value of escrow balances and other servicing  valuation elements. For additional information on mortgage  banking, including key economic assumptions and the sensitivity  of the fair value of MSRs, see   Note 9 (Mortgage Banking  Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to  Financial Statements in this Report.   \nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the  propensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the  servicing portfolio and, therefore, increases the estimated fair  value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also  reduce mortgage loan demand, which reduces noninterest  income from origination activities. A decline in interest rates  would generally have an opposite impact.   \nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our  residential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of  derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar  futures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest  rate options. MSR hedging results include a combination of  directional gain or loss due to market changes as well as any carry  income related to mortgage forward contracts. Carry income  represents accretion from the forward delivery price to the spot  price including both the yield earned on the reference securities  and the market implied cost of financing during the period. A  steep yield curve generally produces higher carry income while a  flat or inverted yield curve can result in lower or potentially  negative carry income.   "}

The objective of effective liquidity management is  to ensure that we can meet our contractual obligations and other  cash commitments efficiently under both normal operating  conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific and/or  market stress. For additional information on these obligations,  see the following sections and Notes to Financial Statements in  this Report:  \n\n \n•   “Commitments to Lend” section within Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 4)  \n\n •   Leasing Activity (Note 5)  \n\n •   Deposits (Note 11)  \n\n •   Long-Term Debt (Note 12)  \n\n •   Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 13)  \n\n •   Employee Benefits and Other Expenses (Note 21)  \n\n •   Income Taxes (Note 23)   \nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity   guidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover  potential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence  on volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are  monitored on a monthly basis by the Corporate ALCO and on a  quarterly basis by the Board. These guidelines are established and  monitored for both the consolidated company and for the Parent  on a stand-alone basis to ensure that the Parent is a source of  strength for its regulated, deposit-taking banking subsidiaries.  The Parent acts as a source of funding for the Company through  the issuance of long-term debt and equity, and WFC Holdings,  LLC, an intermediate holding company and subsidiary of the  Parent (the “IHC”), provides funding support for the ongoing  operational requirements of the Parent and certain of its direct  and indirect subsidiaries. For additional information on the IHC,  see the “Regulatory Matters – ‘Living Will’ Requirements and  Related Matters” section in this Report.   \nLiquidity Stress Tests   Liquidity stress tests are performed to  help ensure that the Company has sufficient liquidity to meet  contractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of  stress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as  corporate-specific events, including a range of stress conditions  and time horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of  \nthe Company’s projected liquidity position during stress and  inform future needs in the Company’s funding plan.   \nContingency Funding Plan  Our contingency funding plan (CFP),  which is approved by Corporate ALCO and the Board’s Risk  Committee, sets out the Company’s strategies and action plans  to address potential liquidity needs during market-wide or  idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP establishes measures for  monitoring emerging liquidity events and describes the  processes for communicating and managing stress events should  they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate funding and liquidity  strategies available to the Company in a period of stress.   \nLiquidity Standards   We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB,  OCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity  requirement consistent with the LCR established by the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). The rule requires a  covered banking organization to hold high-quality liquid assets  (HQLA) in an amount equal to or greater than its projected net  cash outflows during a 30-day stress period. Our HQLA under the  rule predominantly consists of central bank deposits,  government debt securities, and mortgage-backed securities of  federal agencies. The LCR applies to the Company on a  consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions  (IDIs) with total assets of  $\\pounds_{ Ḋ }\\mathrm{1}0 Ḍ$   billion or more. In addition, rules  issued by the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management  standards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as  Wells Fargo.   \nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing  a stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding  ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such  as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding,  including common equity, long-term debt and most types of  deposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and  commitments over a one-year horizon period. The NSFR applies  to the Company on a consolidated basis and to our IDIs with total  assets of   $\\pounds_{ Ḋ }\\mathrm{1}0 Ḍ$   billion or more. As of December 31, 2021, we were  compliant with the NSFR requirement.   \nLiquidity Coverage Ratio  As of December 31, 2021, the  consolidated Company, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo  National Bank West exceeded the minimum LCR requirement of   $100\\%$  , which is calculated as HQLA divided by projected net cash  outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. Table 32 presents  the Company’s quarterly average values for the daily-calculated  LCR and its components calculated pursuant to the LCR rule  requirements.  \nThe table presents financial data related to high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), projected net cash outflows, and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) for certain quarters ending on December 31, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the data:\n\n1. **(in millions, except ratio):**\n   - This indicates that the monetary figures are presented in millions of dollars, while the ratios are not converted to millions.\n\n2. **HQLA (1):**\n   - **Eligible cash:**\n     - December 31, 2021: $210,527 million\n     - September 30, 2021: $244,260 million\n     - December 31, 2020: $213,937 million\n\n   - **Eligible securities (2):**\n     - December 31, 2021: $172,761 million\n     - September 30, 2021: $138,525 million\n     - December 31, 2020: $201,060 million\n\n3. **Total HQLA:**\n   - December 31, 2021: $383,288 million\n   - September 30, 2021: $382,785 million\n   - December 31, 2020: $414,997 million\n\n4. **Projected net cash outflows:**\n   - December 31, 2021: $325,015 million\n   - September 30, 2021: $320,782 million\n   - December 31, 2020: $312,697 million\n\n5. **LCR (Liquidity Coverage Ratio):**\n   - December 31, 2021: 118%\n   - September 30, 2021: 119%\n   - December 31, 2020: 133%\n\nThe table provides a summary of the liquidity position and cash flow expectations for these quarter ends, focusing on the LCR, a key indicator of financial stability and liquidity risk management."}

The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal\nbanking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and\nregulatory requirements for systemically important firms.\nThe FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing\nenhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding\ncompanies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based\ncapital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single\ncounterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity\nlimits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave\nthreat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB\nand OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress\ntesting requirements for large BHCs and national banks. In\naddition, the FRB has proposed a rule to establish\nremediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing\nfinancial distress. Furthermore, in order to promote a BHC’s\nsafety and soundness and the financial and operational\nresilience of its operations, the FRB has finalized guidance\nregarding effective boards of directors of large BHCs and\nhas proposed related guidance identifying core principles for\neffective senior management.

In addition to the\nCompany’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary,\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare\nand periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC\ndetermine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements\non us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we\nadequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC\nultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any\ndeficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or\noperations. On June 29, 2021, we submitted our most recent\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC.\n\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly\nliquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for\nthe appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically\nimportant financial institution that is in default or in danger of\ndefault if, among other things, the resolution of the institution\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse\neffects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is\nappointed as receiver for Wells Fargo & Company (the “Parent”),\nthen the orderly liquidation authority, rather than the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver\nand the rights and obligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s\norderly liquidation authority requires that security holders of a\ncompany in receivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are\nexposed to any losses. There are substantial differences in the\nrights of creditors between the orderly liquidation authority and\nthe U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to\ndisregard the strict priority of creditor claims under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code in certain circumstances and the use of an\nadministrative claims procedure instead of a judicial procedure to\ndetermine creditors’ claims.\n\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings.\nHowever, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo,\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the\nFDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has\n\nannounced that a single point of entry strategy may bea\ndesirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly\nliquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might\nexercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is\npossible.\n\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal\nbanking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo,\nmaintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to\nabsorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal\nbanking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding\nthe failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on\nparent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging\ninstitutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital\nand liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an\norderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28,\n2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended\nand restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with\nWFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo\nSecurities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC\n(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated\nfrom time to time as material entities for resolution planning\npurposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time\nas related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related\nSupport Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the\nParent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including\nthe majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and\nintercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its\nsubsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will\ncontinue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time\nto time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure,\nthe IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide\ncapital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered\nEntities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support\nAgreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the\nParent through subordinated notes and a committed line of\ncredit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected\nto provide the Parent, during business as usual operating\nconditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its\ndebts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other\nobligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these\narrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/\nor capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s\nboard of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S.\nBankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the\ncommitted line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to\npay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which\ncould materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and\nits ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could\nresult in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the\nParent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if\nthe Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective\nobligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC,\nthe Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant\nto arelated security agreement.\n\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a\nrange of options that we may consider during times of\nidiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial\nweaknesses and restore market confidence without\nextraordinary government support.

For example, in order to facilitate the\n\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES\n\nAct), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to\n\nencourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus\n\nmeasures, such as the Small Business Administration’s\n\nPaycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a\n\nnumber of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity\n\nand the functioning of markets, including facilities covering\nmoney market mutual funds and term asset-backed\nsecurities loans. Certain of these measures, including the\n\nacceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection\n\nProgram and the extension of credit under certain FRB\n\nlending facilities, ended in 2021.

For example, in order to facilitate the  Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (CARES  Act), federal banking regulators issued rules designed to  encourage financial institutions to participate in stimulus  measures, such as the Small Business Administration’s  Paycheck Protection Program. Similarly, the FRB launched a  number of lending facilities designed to enhance liquidity  and the functioning of markets, including facilities covering  money market mutual funds and term asset-backed  securities loans. Certain of these measures, including the  acceptance of applications under the Paycheck Protection  Program and the extension of credit under certain FRB  lending facilities, ended in 2021. Federal banking regulators  also issued rules amending the regulatory capital and TLAC  rules and other prudential regulations to temporarily ease  certain restrictions on banking organizations and encourage  the use of certain FRB-established facilities in order to  further promote lending to consumers and businesses.   In addition, the OCC and the FRB issued guidelines for  banks and BHCs related to working with customers affected  by the COVID-19 pandemic, including guidance with respect  to waiving fees, offering repayment accommodations, and  providing payment deferrals. Any current or future rules,  regulations, and guidance related to the COVID-19  pandemic and its impacts could require us to change certain  of our business practices, reduce our revenue and earnings,  impose additional costs on us, or otherwise adversely affect  our business operations and/or competitive position.   Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.  Federal and state governments and government agencies  have demonstrated increased attention to the impacts and  potential risks associated with climate change. For example,  federal banking regulators are reviewing the implications of  climate change on the financial stability of the United States and the identification and management by BHCs of climate- related financial risks. The approaches taken by various  governments and government agencies can vary  significantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any  current or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to  climate change and its impacts could require us to change  certain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and  earnings, impose additional costs on us, or otherwise  adversely affect our business operations and/or competitive  position.   \n"}

We recognize MSRs when we retain servicing\nrights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans we\noriginate (asset transfers), or purchase servicing rights from\nthird parties.

Periodic changes in our residential MSRs and the\neconomic hedges used to hedge our residential MSRs are\nreflected in earnings.\n\nWe use a model to estimate the fair value of our\nresidential MSRs. The model is validated in accordance with\nCompany policies by an internal model validation group. The\nmodel calculates the present value of estimated future net\nservicing income and incorporates inputs and assumptions\nthat market participants use in estimating fair value. Certain\n\nsignificant inputs and assumptions generally are not\n\nobservable in the market and require judgment to determine.\n\nIf observable market indications do become available, these\n\nare factored into the estimates as appropriate:\n\n* The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future\nnet servicing income. The prepayment rate is the annual rate\nat which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage\nloan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower\ndefaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and\nborrower defaults which are influenced by changes in\nmortgage interest rates and borrower behavior.\n\n« The discount rate used to present value estimated future net\nservicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of\nreturn investors in the market would expect for an asset\nwith similar risk. To determine the discount rate, we consider\nthe risk premium for uncertainties in the cash flow estimates\nsuch as from servicing operations (e.g., possible changes in\nfuture servicing costs, ancillary income and earnings on\nescrow accounts).\n\n« The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net\nservicing income. The cost to service loans includes\nestimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency\nand foreclosure costs, which considers the number of\ndefaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service\nloans in default and foreclosure. We use a market\nparticipant's view for our estimated cost to service and our\nactual costs may vary from that estimate.\n\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can,\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and\nmortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in\neither the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results\nin a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in\neither assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of\nthe MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-\ndriven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount\nrate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the\nfuture. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in\nservicing standards, as well as changes in individual state\nforeclosure legislation or changes in market participant\ninformation regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an\nimpact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation\nin future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value\nestimate to independent appraisals.\n\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs,\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage\nBanking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and\nLiabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sella\nfinancial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement\ndate.\n\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value\nadjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair\nvalue disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities\nheld for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS\ndebt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are\ncarried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments,\nsuch as certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity\nsecurities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair\nvalue each period but may require nonrecurring fair value\nadjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market\n\n66 Wells Fargo & Company\n", "vlm_text": "•   Qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in  the loss models.

The discount rate is the required rate of  return investors in the market would expect for an asset  with similar risk.

The cost to service loans includes  estimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency  and foreclosure costs, which considers the number of  defaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service  loans in default and foreclosure. We use a market  participant's view for our estimated cost to service and our   actual costs may vary from that estimate.   \nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can,  and generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and  mortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in  either the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results  in a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in  either assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of  the MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market- driven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount  rate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the  future. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in  servicing standards, as well as changes in individual state  foreclosure legislation or changes in market participant  information regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an  impact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation  in future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value  estimate to independent appraisals.   \nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs,  see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 8   (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities), Note 9 (Mortgage  Banking Activities) and Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and  Liabilities) to Financial Statements in this Report.   \nFair Value of Financial Instruments \nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a  financial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants at the measurement  date.   \nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value  adjustments to certain financial instruments and to fulfill fair  value disclosure requirements. For example, assets and liabilities  held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, AFS  debt securities, derivatives and a majority of our LHFS are  carried at fair value each period. Other financial instruments,  such as certain LHFS, a majority of nonmarketable equity  securities, and loans held for investment, are not carried at fair  value each period but may require nonrecurring fair value  adjustments due to application of lower-of-cost-or-market  accounting, measurement alternative accounting or write- downs of individual assets. We also disclose our estimate of fair  value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as  loans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt.   "}

We also disclose our estimate of fair\nvalue for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, such as\nloans held for investment or issuances of long-term debt.\n\nThe accounting requirements for fair value measurements\ninclude a three-level hierarchy for disclosure of assets and\nliabilities recorded at fair value. The classification of assets and\nliabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to\nthe valuation methodology used for measurement are\nobservable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market-\nderived or market-based information obtained from\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our\nestimates about market data.\n\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable\ninputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to\nmeasure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not\navailable, fair value measurement is based upon models that\ngenerally use market-based or independently sourced market\nparameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment\nrates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when\nobservable market data is limited or not available, fair value\nestimates are typically determined using internal models based\non unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair\nvalue are validated in accordance with Company policies by an\ninternal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party\npricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either\nrecord the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal\nprices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed\nover the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.\n\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs,\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments\nabout significant assumptions that market participants would\nuse to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions\nincludes consideration of many factors, including market\nconditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions,\nsuch as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the availability and\nreliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine\nfair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available\nquoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may\nadjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using\ninternal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact\nof illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair\nvalue measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and\ncertain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs\nhave become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third-\nparty pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model\nuses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market\nparticipant would require in light of the illiquid market.\n\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining\nadjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions\ncan change over time, our determination of which securities\nmarkets are considered active or inactive can change. If we\ndetermine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted\nprices require adjustment, can also change.\n\nSignificant judgment is also applied in the determination of\nwhether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this\n\njudgment, we consider available information, including\nobservable market data, indications of market liquidity and\norderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques\nand significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The\nclassification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts\n\nand circumstances of each instrument or instrument category\nand judgments are made regarding the significance of\nunobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are\nconsidered significant to the fair value measurement, the\ninstrument is classified as Level 3.\n\nTable 48 presents our (1) assets and liabilities recorded at\nfair value ona recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a\npercentage of our total assets and total liabilities.\n\nTable 48: Fair Value Level 3 Summary\n\nDecember 31, 2021 December 31, 2020\n\nTotal Total\n($ in billions) balance —_ Level 3 (1) balance Level 3 (1)\nAssets recorded at fair\nvalue on a recurring $ 348.9 19.6 380.3 219\nbasis\nAs a percentage\nof total assets 18 % 1 19 1\nLiabilities recorded at fair\nvalue ona recurring $ 30.1 2.6 39.0 2.0\nbasis\nAsa percentage of 2% * 2 *\n\ntotal liabilities\n\n* Less than 1%.\n(1) Before derivative netting adjustments.\n\nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on\nour fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement\ntechniques and the impact to our financial statements.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we\noperate and evaluate income tax expense in two components:\ncurrent and deferred income tax expense.

The classification of assets and  liabilities within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to  the valuation methodology used for measurement are  observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market- derived or market-based information obtained from  independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our  estimates about market data.   \nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the  use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable  inputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to  measure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not  available, fair value measurement is based upon models that  generally use market-based or independently sourced market  parameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment  rates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when  observable market data is limited or not available, fair value  estimates are typically determined using internal models based  on unobservable inputs. Internal models used to determine fair  value are validated in accordance with Company policies by an  internal model validation group. Additionally, we use third-party  pricing services to obtain fair values, which are used to either  record the price of an instrument or to corroborate internal  prices. Third-party price validation procedures are performed  over the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.   \nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs,  management judgment is necessary as we make judgments  about significant assumptions that market participants would  use to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions  includes consideration of many factors, including market  conditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions,  such as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in  secondary market activities, may reduce the availability and  reliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine  fair value. In such cases, it may be appropriate to adjust available  quoted prices or observable market data. For example, we may  adjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using  internal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact  of illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair  value measurement. Additionally, for certain residential LHFS and  certain debt and equity securities where the significant inputs  have become unobservable due to illiquid markets and a third- party pricing service is not used, our discounted cash flow model  uses a discount rate that reflects what we believe a market  participant would require in light of the illiquid market.  \nWe continually assess the level and volume of market  activity in our debt and equity security classes in determining  adjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions  can change over time, our determination of which securities  markets are considered active or inactive can change. If we  determine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted  prices require adjustment, can also change.  \nSignificant judgment is also applied in the determination of  whether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as  Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this  judgment, we consider available information, including  observable market data, indications of market liquidity and  orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques  and significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The  classification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts  and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category  and judgments are made regarding the significance of  unobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value  measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are  considered significant to the fair value measurement, the  instrument is classified as Level 3.   \n\nTable 48 presents our (1) assets and liabilities recorded at  fair value on a recurring basis and (2) Level 3 assets and liabilities  recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, both presented as a  percentage of our total assets and total liabilities.  \nThe table provides financial data comparing December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. It includes:\n\n1. **Assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:**\n   - 2021: Total balance is $348.9 billion, with Level 3 assets at $19.6 billion.\n   - 2020: Total balance is $380.3 billion, with Level 3 assets at $21.9 billion.\n\n2. **As a percentage of total assets:**\n   - 2021: 18% of total assets, Level 3 assets 1%.\n   - 2020: 19% of total assets, Level 3 assets 1%.\n\n3. **Liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:**\n   - 2021: Total balance is $30.1 billion, with Level 3 liabilities at $2.6 billion.\n   - 2020: Total balance is $39.0 billion, with Level 3 liabilities at $2.0 billion.\n\n4. **As a percentage of total liabilities:**\n   - 2021: 2% of total liabilities.\n   - 2020: 2% of total liabilities.\n\nThe data is expressed in billions of dollars.\nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to   Financial Statements in this Report for a complete discussion on  our fair value of financial instruments, our related measurement  techniques and the impact to our financial statements.   \nIncome Taxes \nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we  operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components:  current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax  expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded  for the current period and includes income tax expense related to  uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the  more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to  determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax  position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that  management believes has a greater than   $50\\%$   likelihood of  realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our  realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.  \nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet  method and deferred income tax expense results from changes  in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the  balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is  based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and  tax basis of assets and liabilities, and recognizes enacted changes  in tax rates and laws in the period in which they occur. Deferred  tax assets are recognized subject to management’s judgment  that realization is more likely than not. A valuation allowance  reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount.   \nThe income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate  are complex and subject to different interpretations by  management and the relevant government taxing authorities. In  establishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make  judgments about the application of these inherently complex tax  laws. We must also make estimates about when in the future  certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax  jurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review  during examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise  over the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these  disputes during the tax examination and audit process and  ultimately through the court systems when applicable.

We\ngenerate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the\nloans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial\namount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest\nincome and fee income that we earn from our consumer and\ncommercial lending and banking businesses, including our\nmortgage banking business. These businesses have been, and will\ncontinue to be, materially affected by the state of the U.S.\neconomy, particularly unemployment levels and home prices. The\nnegative effects and continued uncertainty stemming from U.S.\nfiscal, monetary and political matters, including concerns about\ndeficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes and U.S. debt ratings, have\nimpacted and may continue to impact the global economy.\nMoreover, geopolitical matters, including international political\nunrest or disturbances, the United Kingdom’s exit from the\nEuropean Union, as well as continued concerns over commodity\nprices, restrictions on international trade and corresponding\nretaliatory measures, and global economic difficulties, may\nimpact the stability of financial markets and the global economy.\nAny impacts to the global economy could have a similar impact\nto the U.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the\nglobal economy or any deterioration in general economic\nconditions and/or the financial markets resulting from the above\nmatters or any other events or factors that may disrupt or\nweaken the U.S. or global economy, could materially adversely\naffect our financial results and condition.\n\nA weakening in business or economic conditions, including\nhigher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as\nhigher interest rates, can also adversely affect our borrowers’\nability to repay their loans, which can negatively impact our credit\nperformance. If unemployment levels worsen or if home prices\nfall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs and provision\nexpense from increases in our allowance for credit losses. These\nconditions may adversely affect not only consumer loan\nperformance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially for\nthose business borrowers that rely on the health of industries\nthat may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The\nability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may\ndeteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE\nlenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In\naddition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it\nmore challenging for us to increase our consumer and\ncommercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy\nborrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic\nconditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest\nrates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our\nretaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on\n\nour consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions do not\ncontinue to improve or if the economy worsens and\nunemployment rises, which also would likely result in a decrease\nin consumer and business confidence and spending, the demand\nfor our credit products, including our mortgages, may fall,\nreducing our interest and noninterest income and our earnings.\n\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which\nmay erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or\nincreased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely\naffect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our\ninvestment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management,\nmarkets and investment banking businesses. For example,\nbecause investment advisory fees are often based on the value of\nassets under management, a fall in the market prices of those\nassets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market\nprices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing\ncommissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage\nbusiness. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively\naffect the performance of products we have provided to\ncustomers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional\ncosts.

The pandemic could also result in or contribute to\nadditional downgrades to our credit ratings or credit outlook. In\nresponse to the pandemic, we previously suspended certain\nmortgage foreclosure activities and provided fee waivers,\npayment deferrals, and other expanded assistance for certain\nconsumer and commercial lending customers, and future\ngovernmental actions may again require these and other types of\ncustomer-related responses. Our participation in governmental\nmeasures taken to address the economic impact from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic could result in reputational harm, as well as\ncontinue to result in litigation and government investigations\nand proceedings. In addition, we reduced our common stock\ndividend and temporarily suspended share repurchases, and we\ncould take, or be required to take, other capital actions in the\nfuture. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of\nincreasing the likelihood and/or magnitude of the other risks\ndescribed herein, including credit, market and operational related\nrisks, particularly if the pandemic continues to adversely affect\nthe global economy. The extent to which the COVID-19\npandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity\nratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and\nduration of the pandemic, the effectiveness, availability and use\nof vaccines, the emergence and impact of COVID-19 variants,\nand actions taken by governmental authorities and other third\nparties in response to the pandemic.\n\nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could\nreduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our\nother comprehensive income, including as a result of\nrecognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we\nhold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in\neither our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning\nassets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the\nFebruary 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net\ninterest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can\naffect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our\nassets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction\nin response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster\nthan the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or\ncontract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on\nour assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than\nour funding costs, our net interest margin could contract.\n\nThe amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect\nour yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the\nform of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets.\nAs noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower\ndemand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield\nand net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and\nnet interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged\nlow interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower\nyielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet,\nparticularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher\nyielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in\ninterest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and\n\ncould result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more\ndifficulty making higher interest payments. As described below,\nchanges in interest rates also affect our mortgage business,\nincluding the value of our MSRs.\n\nChanges in the slope of the “yield curve” — or the spread\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates — could also\nreduce our net interest income and net interest margin.\nNormally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term\nrates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve\nflattens, or even inverts, our net interest income and net interest\nmargin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding\nincreases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term\nassets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which\ninterest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest\nincome and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the\ninterest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while\nalso likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the\nFRB.\n\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on\nassumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of\ninterest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may\nhedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate\nderivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our\nmortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as\ntheir revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based\non changes in interest rates.\n\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or\noption volatility could reduce our net interest income and\nearnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material\namounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially\ndifferent than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates\nrise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve\nchanges, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we\nhold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may\nrebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and\nloans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We\nmay incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes\nin interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could\nlimit the effectiveness of our hedging activities.\n\nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as\nwell as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of\nany underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-\nthan-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the\nsecurities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities\nwe hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer\ncreditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is\nexposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign\nexchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection\nwith our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to\naccommodate the investment and risk management activities of\nour customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to\nmanage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and\nequity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest\nincome. As part of our business to support our customers, we\ntrade public debt and equity securities that are subject to market\nfluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In\naddition, although high market volatility can increase our\nexposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may\nhave an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced\ncustomer activity levels.

The extent to which the COVID-19  pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, and  financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital and liquidity  ratios, will depend on future developments, which are highly  uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and  duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness, availability and use  of vaccines, the emergence and impact of COVID-19 variants,  and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third  parties in response to the pandemic.   \nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could  reduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our  other comprehensive income, including as a result of  recognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we  hold in our portfolio or trade for our customers.     Changes in  either our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning  assets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the  February 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net  interest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can  affect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our  assets and our funding costs tend to move in the same direction  in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster  than the other, causing our net interest margin to expand or  contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the yield we earn on  our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets falls faster than  our funding costs, our net interest margin could contract.   \nThe amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect  our yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the  form of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets.  As noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower  demand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield  and net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and  net interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged  low interest rate environment as it may result in us holding lower  yielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet,  particularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher  yielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. Increases in  interest rates, however, may negatively affect loan demand and  could result in higher credit losses as borrowers may have more  difficulty making higher interest payments. As described below,  changes in interest rates also affect our mortgage business,  including the value of our MSRs.   \n\nChanges in the slope of the “yield curve” – or the spread  between short-term and long-term interest rates – could also  reduce our net interest income and net interest margin.  Normally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term  rates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve  flattens, or even inverts, our net interest income and net interest  margin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding  increases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term  assets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which  interest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest  income and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the  interest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while  also likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with the  FRB.   \nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on  our earnings under various scenarios that differ based on  assumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of  interest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may  hedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate  derivatives. We also rely on the “natural hedge” that our  mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can provide as  their revenue impact tends to move in opposite directions based  on changes in interest rates.   \nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There  is always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or  option volatility could reduce our net interest income and  earnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material  amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially  different than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates  rise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve  changes, we may incur significant losses on debt securities we  hold as investments. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may  rebalance our portfolios of debt securities, equity securities and  loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic actions. We  may incur losses when we take such actions. In addition, changes  in interest rates can result in increased basis risk, which could  limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities.   \nBecause of changing economic and market conditions, as  well as credit ratings, affecting issuers and the performance of  any underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other­ than-temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods on the  securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the debt securities  we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, issuer  credit worthiness, and other factors. Our net income also is  exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, foreign  exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in connection  with our trading activities, which are conducted primarily to  accommodate the investment and risk management activities of  our customers, as well as when we execute economic hedging to  manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt securities and  equity securities held for trading are carried at fair value with  realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in noninterest  income. As part of our business to support our customers, we  trade public debt and equity securities that are subject to market  fluctuations with gains and losses recognized in net income. In  addition, although high market volatility can increase our  exposure to trading-related losses, periods of low volatility may  have an adverse effect on our businesses as a result of reduced  customer activity levels. Although we have processes in place to  measure and monitor the risks associated with our trading  activities, including stress testing and hedging strategies, there  can be no assurance that our processes and strategies will be  effective in avoiding losses that could have a material adverse  effect on our financial results.

The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules\nimplementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and\nnational banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to\nestablish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing\nfinancial distress and has proposed additional requirements\nregarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs,\nincluding its expectations for boards of directors and senior\nmanagement.

Any requirement that\nwe increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or\nliquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements,\nsuch as to the Basel standards, or as a result of business growth,\nacquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to\nliquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product\nofferings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect\nour financial results. Although not currently anticipated,\nproposed capital requirements and/or our regulators may require\nus to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional\ncommon stock may dilute the ownership of existing\nstockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may\ncontinue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our\nability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products\nand services to our customers.\n\nFor additional information, see the “Capital Management,”\n“Risk Management — Asset/Liability Management — Liquidity Risk\nand Funding — Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters”\nsections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision”\nsection in our 2021 Form 10-K.\n\nFRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can\nsignificantly affect business and economic conditions and our\nfinancial results and condition. The FRB regulates the supply of\nmoney in the United States. Its policies determine in large part\nour cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we\nearn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our\nnet interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest\nrate policies also can materially affect the value of financial\ninstruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In\naddition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially\nincreasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.\nChanges in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal\nfunds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its\nbalance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.\nAs noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and\na flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions\ncould negatively affect our net interest income and net interest\n\nmargin, as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and\ndebt securities on our consolidated balance sheet.\n\nCREDIT RISKS\n\nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in\neconomic conditions or changes in market conditions, could\nrequire us to increase our provision for credit losses and\nallowance for credit losses and could have a material adverse\neffect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit\nrisk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans.\nAs one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance\nof our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results\nand condition. As noted above, if the current economic\nenvironment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may\nhave difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which\ncould result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for\ncredit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an\nallowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this\nallowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in\nour loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The\nprocess for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to\nour financial results and condition.

The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations  implementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs  like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk  and liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and  imposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators  determine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the  United States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules  implementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and  national banks. In addition, the FRB has proposed a rule to  establish remediation requirements for large BHCs experiencing  financial distress and has proposed additional requirements  regarding effective risk management practices at large BHCs,  including its expectations for boards of directors and senior  management. The OCC, under separate authority, has also  established heightened governance and risk management  standards for large national banks, such as the Bank.   \nThe Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage,  liquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may  limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including  common stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require  us to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that  we increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or  liquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements,  such as to the Basel standards, or as a result of business growth,  acquisitions or a change in our risk profile, could require us to  liquidate assets or otherwise change our business, product  offerings and/or investment plans, which may negatively affect  our financial results. Although not currently anticipated,  proposed capital requirements and/or our regulators may require  us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional  common stock may dilute the ownership of existing  stockholders. In addition, federal banking regulations may  continue to increase our compliance costs as well as limit our  ability to invest in our business or provide loans or other products  and services to our customers.  \nFor additional information, see the “Capital Management,”  “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk  and Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters”  sections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision”  section in our 2021 Form 10-K.   \nFRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can  significantly affect business and economic conditions and our  financial results and condition.   The FRB regulates the supply of  money in the United States. Its policies determine in large part  our cost of funds for lending and investing and the return we  earn on those loans and investments, both of which affect our  net interest income and net interest margin. The FRB’s interest  rate policies also can materially affect the value of financial  instruments we hold, such as debt securities and MSRs. In  addition, its policies can affect our borrowers, potentially  increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans.  Changes in FRB policies, including its target range for the federal  funds rate or actions taken to increase or decrease the size of its  balance sheet, are beyond our control and can be hard to predict.  As noted above, a declining or low interest rate environment and  a flattening yield curve which may result from the FRB’s actions  could negatively affect our net interest income and net interest  margin, as it may result in us holding lower yielding loans and  debt securities on our consolidated balance sheet.   \n\nCREDIT RISKS \nIncreased credit risk, including as a result of a deterioration in  economic conditions or changes in market conditions,   could  require us to increase our   provision for credit losses and   allowance for credit losses   and could have a material adverse  effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    \nWhen we loan money or commit to loan money we incur credit  risk, or the risk of losses if our borrowers do not repay their loans.  As one of the largest lenders in the U.S., the credit performance  of our loan portfolios significantly affects our financial results  and condition. As noted above, if the current economic  environment were to deteriorate, more of our customers may  have difficulty in repaying their loans or other obligations which  could result in a higher level of credit losses and provision for  credit losses. We reserve for credit losses by establishing an  allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this  allowance is based on our assessment of credit losses inherent in  our loan portfolio (including unfunded credit commitments). The  process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to  our financial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective  and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of  economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of  our borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the  allowance because of changing economic conditions, including  falling home prices, higher unemployment or inflation, significant  loan growth, changes in consumer behavior or other market  conditions that adversely affect borrowers, or other factors.  Additionally, the regulatory environment or external factors, such  as natural disasters, disease pandemics, political or social  matters, or trade policies, also can influence recognition of credit  losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for credit  losses.   \nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a  variety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit  quality and mix changes, and changes in general economic  conditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses  was appropriate at December 31, 2021, there is no assurance  that it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses, especially if  housing and employment conditions worsen. In the event of  significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we  experience significant loan growth, we may be required to build  reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.   \nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management –  Credit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies –  Allowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report.   \nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the  extent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry  segment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or  \ncollateral.   Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our  loans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or  similar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group  may be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or  market conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market  conditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or  geography may also impact related or dependent industries or  the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in  such industries to meet their financial obligations. We  experienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010  when we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential  real estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater  than expected deterioration in residential real estate values in  many markets, including the Central Valley California market and  several Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As  California is our largest banking state in terms of loans and  deposits, deterioration in real estate values and underlying  economic conditions in those markets or elsewhere in California  could result in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes  in consumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely  affect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may  increase our credit risk and reduce the demand by these  borrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration  in macro-economic conditions generally across the country could  result in materially higher credit losses, including for our  residential real estate loan portfolio, which includes  nonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet.  We may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as  our consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their  contractual end of draw period and begin to amortize.   "}

As these  threats continue to evolve, we expect to continue to be required  to expend significant resources to develop and enhance our  protective measures or to investigate and remediate any  information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Because the  investigation of any information security breach is inherently  unpredictable and would require time to complete, we may not  be able to immediately address the consequences of a breach,  which may further increase any associated costs and  consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers  aspects of information security risk, such insurance may not be  sufficient to cover all losses associated with an information  security breach.   \nCyber attacks or other information security breaches  affecting us or third parties on which we rely, including those that  facilitate our business activities or to which we outsource  operations, or security breaches of the networks, systems or  devices that our customers use to access our products and  services, could result in business disruptions, loss of revenue or  customers, legal or regulatory proceedings, compliance,  remediation and other costs, violations of applicable privacy and  other laws, reputational damage, or other adverse consequences,  any of which could materially adversely affect our results of  operations or financial condition.   \nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in  mitigating risk and loss to us.   Our risk management framework  seeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established  processes and procedures intended to identify, measure,  monitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are  subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest  rate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and  reputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk  "}

Our risk management framework is also\ndependent on ensuring that effective operational controls anda\nsound culture exist throughout the Company. The inability to\ndevelop effective operational controls or to foster the\nappropriate culture in each of our lines of business, including the\ninability to align performance management and compensation to\nachieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the\neffectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we\nare unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we\nmay be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses.

In certain instances, we rely on models to measure,\nmonitor and predict risks, such as market, interest rate and credit\nrisks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, there\nis no assurance that these models will appropriately or\nsufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future\nevents or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are\nsubject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to\nmeet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines,\npenalties, restrictions on our ability to engage in certain business\nactivities, or other adverse consequences, and any required\nmodifications or changes to these models can impact our capital\nratios and requirements and result in increased operational and\ncompliance costs. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and\nassess our various risk exposures and business activities, and any\nissues with the quality or effectiveness of our data, including our\naggregation, management, and validation procedures, could\nresult in ineffective risk management practices, business\ndecisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or\ninaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting.

There can be no assurance as to the ultimate\noutcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for\nlegal actions when potential losses associated with the actions\nbecome probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We\nmay still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not\nestablished an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a\nlegal action may be substantially higher than any amounts\naccrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal\nproceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought\nand granted, could materially adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nAs noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory\noversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory\n\ninvestigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition\nto imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business\nrestrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may\nrequire criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and\ncompliance with other conditions in connection with settling\nsuch matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of\ncustomers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets,\nlimitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in\ncertain business activities or offer certain products or services,\nand/or other direct and indirect adverse effects.\n\nFor additional information, see Note 15 (Legal Actions) to\nFinancial Statements in this Report.\n\nMORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS\n\nOur mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to\nquarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates,\nand we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to\nreduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new\nmortgage loans. We are one of the largest mortgage originators\nand residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn\nrevenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and\nfor servicing mortgage loans.

For example,\nthe negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value\nof residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting\nrevenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to\nthe new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible\nthat, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or\ndeteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fa\nor remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase\nin mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the\ndecrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.\n\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk.

The physical effects of climate  change, including the increased prevalence and severity of  extreme weather events and natural disasters, such as  hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere  with our operations or those of our third-party service providers,  which could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause  losses. Climate change related impacts could also negatively  affect the financial condition of our customers, increase the  credit risk associated with those customers, or result in the  deterioration of the value of the collateral we hold. In addition,  changes in consumer behavior or other market conditions on  account of climate considerations or due to the transition to a  low carbon economy may adversely affect customers in certain  industries or sectors, which may increase our credit risk and  reduce the demand by these customers for our products and  services. Furthermore, the transition to a low carbon economy  could affect our business practices or result in additional costs or  other adverse consequences to our business operations.  Legislation and/or regulation in connection with climate change,  as well as stakeholder perceptions regarding climate change,  could also require us to change certain of our business and/or risk  management practices, impose additional costs on us, or  otherwise adversely affect our business. Moreover, our  reputation may be damaged as a result of our response to  climate change or our strategy for the transition to a low carbon  economy, including if we are unable to achieve our objectives or if  our response is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient. For  additional information on regulatory developments in response  to climate change, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this  Report.   \nWe are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse  consequences from legal actions.   Wells Fargo and some of its  subsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental,  arbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning  matters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and  many of those proceedings and investigations expose  Wells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse  consequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate  outcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for  legal actions when potential losses associated with the actions  become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We  may still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not  established an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a  legal action may be substantially higher than any amounts  accrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal  proceeding or investigation, depending on the remedy sought  and granted, could materially adversely affect our results of  operations and financial condition.   \nAs noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory  oversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory  \ninvestigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition  to imposing potentially significant monetary penalties, business  restrictions, and other sanctions, regulatory authorities may  require criminal pleas or other admissions of wrongdoing and  compliance with other conditions in connection with settling  such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, loss of  customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital markets,  limitations on capital distributions, the inability to engage in  certain business activities or offer certain products or services,  and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects.  \nFor additional information, see Note 15 (Legal Actions) to  Financial Statements in this Report.   \nMORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \nOur mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to  quarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates,  and we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to  reduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new  \nmortgage loans.   We are one of the largest mortgage originators  and residential mortgage servicers in the U.S., and we earn  revenue from fees we receive for originating mortgage loans and  for servicing mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates can affect  prepayment assumptions and thus the fair value of our MSRs.  When interest rates fall, borrowers are usually more likely to  prepay their mortgage loans by refinancing them at a lower rate.  As the likelihood of prepayment increases, the fair value of our  MSRs can decrease. Changes in interest rates can also negatively  affect the fair value of certain residential mortgage loans within  LHFS and other interests we hold related to residential loan sales  and securitizations. For example, similar to other interest- bearing securities, if market interest rates increase relative to the  yield on these residential mortgage LHFS and other interests,  their fair value may fall.   \nWhen rates rise, the demand for mortgage loans usually  tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from loan  originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our MSRs  can increase through increases in fair value. When rates fall,  mortgage originations usually tend to increase and the value of  our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with some offsetting  revenue effect. Even though they can act as a “natural hedge,”  the hedge is not perfect, either in amount or timing. For example,  the negative effect on revenue from a decrease in the fair value  of residential MSRs is generally immediate, but any offsetting  revenue benefit from more originations and the MSRs relating to  the new loans would generally accrue over time. It is also possible  that, because of economic conditions and/or a weak or  deteriorating housing market, even if interest rates were to fall  or remain low, mortgage originations may also fall or any increase  in mortgage originations may not be enough to offset the  decrease in the MSRs value caused by the lower rates.   \nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge  our mortgage banking interest rate risk.

We establish a mortgage repurchase liability that\nreflects management’s estimate of losses for loans for which we\nhave a repurchase obligation. Because the level of mortgage loan\nrepurchase losses depends upon economic factors, investor\ndemand strategies and other external conditions that may\nchange over the life of the underlying loans, the level of the\nliability for mortgage loan repurchase losses is difficult to\nestimate, requires considerable management judgment, and is\nsubject to change. If economic conditions or the housing market\nworsen, we could have increased repurchase obligations and\nincreased loss severity on repurchases, requiring significant\nadditions to the repurchase liability.\n\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we\noriginate, we could become subject to monetary damages and\nother civil penalties, including the loss of certain contractual\npayments or the inability to exercise certain remedies under the\nloans such as foreclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or\ndetermined that the loans were not originated in accordance with\napplicable laws or regulations.\n\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may face a number of\nconsequences, including termination as servicer or master\nservicer, requirements to indemnify the securitization trustee\nagainst losses from any failure by us to perform our servicing\nobligations, and/or contractual obligations to repurchase a\n\nmortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses, any of\nwhich could significantly reduce our net servicing income.\n\nWe may also incur costs, liabilities to borrowers, title\ninsurers and/or securitization investors, legal proceedings, or\nother adverse consequences if we fail to meet our servicing\nobligations, including with respect to mortgage foreclosure\nactions or if we experience delays in the foreclosure process. Our\nnet servicing income and the fair value of our MSRs may be\nnegatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase\nbecause of higher foreclosure or other servicing related costs.

In addition, debt securities that\nare held for investment purposes that we have elected to\naccount for under the fair value method, are classified as trading.\n\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair\nvalue recognized in net gains on trading and securities within\nnoninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are\nrecognized in net interest income.\n\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments\nand market-making activities. We also take positions to manage\nour exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold\nfinancial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short\npositions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary,\nwe interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the\npurchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the\nanticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we\nmay purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to\nmanage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an\noffsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure\nto the customer transaction. We earn income based on the\ntransaction price difference between the customer transaction\nand the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where\nthe fair value changes and related interest income and expense of\nthe positions are recorded.\n\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These\nactivities are typically executed on a short-term basis. Asa\nmarket-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference\nbetween the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of\nthe security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the\npositions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading\npositions held on our consolidated balance sheet.

For purchased callable debt securities carried at a\npremium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the\n\nnext call date using the effective interest method.

Additional considerations\nfor certain types of AFS debt securities include:\n¢ Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies,\nincluding federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit\nmovements given the explicit or implicit guarantees\nprovided by the U.S. government.\n« Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are\nmost impacted by changes in the relationship between\nmunicipal and term funding credit curves rather than by\nchanges in the credit quality of the underlying securities.\ne Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also\nimpacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets\nunderlying the security.\n\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we\nhave the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not\nthat we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its\namortized cost basis. Impairment is recognized in net gains on\ntrading and securities within noninterest income equal to the\ndifference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the\nfair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of\nthis impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost\nbasis is fair value.\n\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in\nearnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the\nextent unrealized loss is due to credit losses.

Following the recognition of  this impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost  basis is fair value.  \nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than  amortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in  earnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the  extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance  for Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies  relating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt  securities classified as HTM.  \nTRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES   Upon  transfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification,  the amortized cost is reset to fair value adjusted for any ACL  previously recorded under the AFS debt security model.  Unrealized gains or losses at the transfer date continue to be  reported in cumulative OCI. The cumulative OCI balance is  amortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized  premiums and discounts using the effective interest method.  Any ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model  is reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re- established.

At\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, short-term borrowings were\nprimarily comprised of securities sold under repurchase\nagreements.\n\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and\nresidential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the\nsecuritization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair\nvalue option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 17 (Fair\nValues of Assets and Liabilities)). The remaining residential LHFS\nare held at the lower of cost or fair value (LOCOM) and are\nmeasured on a pool level basis.\nCommercial LHFS are generally held at LOCOM and are\nmeasured on an individual loan basis. We have elected the fair\nvalue option for certain commercial loans included in LHFS that\nare used in market-making activities for our trading business.\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest\nincome. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net\ngains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are\nrecognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination\ncosts and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are\nrecognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at\nLOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at\norigination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale.\nInterest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate\nof the loan and is recorded in interest income.\nWhen a determination is made at the time of commitment\nto originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold\nthese loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to\nperiodic review under our management evaluation processes,\nincluding corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent\nchanges occur, including changes in interest rates, our business\nstrategy, or other market conditions, we may change our\nintent to hold these loans. When management makes this\ndetermination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS\nportfolio at LOCOM.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of\nany unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized\ndeferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized\npremiums or discounts on purchased loans.\n\nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts\nand premiums are amortized to interest income over the\ncontractual life of the loan using the effective interest method.\nLoan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred and\namortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the\ncommitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon funding,\ndeferred loan commitment fees are amortized to interest income\nover the contractual life of the loan.\n\nLoans also include financing leases where we are the lessor.\nSee the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting\npolicy for leases.\n\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS We generally place loans on\nnonaccrual status when:\n\ne the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes\nuncertain (generally based on an assessment of the\nborrower's financial condition and the adequacy of collateral,\nany), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances;\n\ne — they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential\nmortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the\nloan is both well-secured and in the process of collection or\nthe loan is in an active payment deferral as a result of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic;\n\n* part of the principal balance has been charged off; or\n\n¢ — for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the\nrelated first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in\nthe process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien\ndelinquency status.\n\nCredit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are\ngenerally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past\ndue.\n\nWhen we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the\naccrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and\nsuspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate\ncollectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt ona\nnonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash\ncollected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan\nto zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise,\ninterest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received.\nGenerally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent\ninterest and principal become current under the terms of the\nloan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and\ninterest is no longer doubtful.\n\nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a\nrestructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of\nsustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial\nstrength, including documented income, debt to income ratios\nand other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated\nperformance under the previous terms and the underwriting\nprocess shows the capacity to continue to perform under the\nrestructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing\nstatus. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring\n(TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan\neither continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will\nreturn to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a\nsustained period of performance (generally six consecutive\nmonths of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive\npayments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed\non nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded\n\nWells Fargo & Company 99\n", "vlm_text": "\nOur debt securities are considered past due when  contractually required principal or interest payments have not  been made on the due dates.   \nOur charge-off policy for debt securities are similar to those  described for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt security  will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process described  above for any cash received.   \nSecurities Purchased and Sold Agreements \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold  under repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized  financing transactions and are recorded at the acquisition or sale  price plus accrued interest. We monitor the fair value of  securities purchased and sold as well as the collateral pledged and  received. Additional collateral is pledged or returned to maintain  the appropriate collateral position for the transactions. These  financing transactions do not create material credit risk given the  collateral provided and the related monitoring process. We  include securities sold under repurchase agreements in short- term borrowings on our consolidated balance sheet. At  December 31, 2021 and 2020, short-term borrowings were  primarily comprised of securities sold under repurchase  agreements.   \nLoans Held for Sale \nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes commercial and  residential mortgage loans originated or purchased for sale in the  securitization or whole loan market. We have elected the fair  value option for a majority of residential LHFS (see Note 17 (Fair  Values of Assets and Liabilities)).

Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net  gains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are  recognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination  costs and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are  recognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at  LOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at  origination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale.  Interest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate  of the loan and is recorded in interest income.   \nWhen a determination is made at the time of commitment  to originate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold  these loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to  periodic review under our management evaluation processes,  including corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent  changes occur, including changes in interest rates, our business  strategy, or other market conditions, we may change our   intent to hold these loans. When management makes this  determination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS  portfolio at LOCOM.   \nLoans \nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of  any unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized  deferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized  premiums or discounts on purchased loans.   \nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts  and premiums are amortized to interest income over the  contractual life of the loan using the effective interest method.  Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred and  amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis over the  commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon funding,  deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to interest income  over the contractual life of the loan.  \nLoans also include financing leases where we are the lessor.  See the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting  policy for leases.   \nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS   We generally place loans on  nonaccrual status when:  \n\n \n•   the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain (generally based on an assessment of the  borrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral,  if any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances;  \n\n •   they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential  mortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the   loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection or  the loan is in an active payment deferral as a result of the  COVID-19 pandemic;  \n\n •   part of the principal balance has been charged off; or  \n\n •   for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the  related first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in  the process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien  delinquency status.   \nCredit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are  generally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past  due.   \nWhen we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the  accrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and  suspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate  collectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a  nonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash  collected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan  to zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise,  interest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received.  Generally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent  interest and principal become current under the terms of the  loan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and  interest is no longer doubtful.   \nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a  restructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of  sustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial  strength, including documented income, debt to income ratios  and other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated  performance under the previous terms and the underwriting  process shows the capacity to continue to perform under the  restructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing  status. When a loan classified as a troubled debt restructuring  (TDR) performs in accordance with its modified terms, the loan  either continues to accrue interest (for performing loans) or will  return to accrual status after the borrower demonstrates a  sustained period of performance (generally six consecutive  months of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of consecutive  payments made prior to the modification). Loans will be placed  on nonaccrual status and a corresponding charge-off is recorded  if the re-underwriting did not include an evaluation of the  borrower's ability to repay or we believe it is probable that  principal and interest contractually due under the modified terms  of the agreement will not be collectible.

Additionally,\nwe elected to apply the lease modification relief provided by the\nFASB for leases accounted for under ASC 842, Leases, that were\nmodified due to COVID-19 and met certain criteria so as to not\nrequire a new lease classification test upon modification. During\n2021, we continued to apply the TDR relief provided by the\nCARES Act and Interagency Statement for eligible COVID-\nrelated residential mortgage loan modifications. The TDR relief\nprovided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after\nJanuary 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending\naccommodations may continue to be eligible for TDR relief under\nthe Interagency Statement.\nFor COVID-related modifications in the form of payment\ndeferrals or payment forbearance, delinquency status will not\nadvance and loans that were accruing at the time the relief is\nprovided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during\nthe deferral period.

These modified terms may include interest  rate reductions, principal forgiveness, term extensions, payment  forbearance and other actions intended to minimize our  economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the  collateral, if applicable. For modifications where we forgive  principal, the entire amount of such principal forgiveness is  immediately charged off. If the underwriting for a TDR  modification did not include an evaluation of the borrower's  ability to repay, the loan is deemed collateral dependent.

Additionally,  we elected to apply the lease modification relief provided by the  FASB for leases accounted for under ASC 842,  Leases , that were  modified due to COVID-19 and met certain criteria so as to not  require a new lease classification test upon modification. During  2021, we continued to apply the TDR relief provided by the  CARES Act and Interagency Statement for eligible COVID- related residential mortgage loan modifications. The TDR relief  provided by the CARES Act guidance is no longer available after  January 1, 2022; however, certain COVID-related lending  accommodations may continue to be eligible for TDR relief under  the Interagency Statement.   \n\nFor COVID-related modifications in the form of payment  deferrals or payment forbearance, delinquency status will not  advance and loans that were accruing at the time the relief is  provided will generally not be placed on nonaccrual status during  the deferral period. Interest accrued during payment deferrals or  payment forbearance may be included in the principal balance of  the loans and charge-offs will generally be based on delinquency  status after the loan exits the deferral or forbearance period.   \nFORECLOSED ASSETS   Foreclosed assets obtained through our  lending activities primarily include real estate. Generally, loans  have been written down to their net realizable value prior to  foreclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is  recorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure.

Probability of default, loss severity at the time of\ndefault, and exposure at default are statistically derived through\nhistorical observations of default and losses after default within\neach credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as\nappropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted\neconomic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit\ncommitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to\nderive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated\nprobability of default and loss severity at the time of default are\napplied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses\nfor unfunded credit commitments.\n\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled\napproach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans\nwithin those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that\nestimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of\ndefault and exposure at default are typically leveraged to\nestimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans,\ngenerally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such\nas residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.\nAs appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further\nstratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type,\ngeographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use\nattributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation\n(FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the\ndevelopment of our consumer loan models, in addition to home\nprice trends, unemployment trends, and other economic\nvariables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses\nin the consumer portfolio.\n\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS The ACL includes amounts for\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our\nloss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment\nof risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the\nACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level\nbelow our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic\nenvironmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance,\nprocess risk, and other subjective factors, including industry\ntrends and emerging risk assessments.\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES Our off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally\nin the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not\naccounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including\nstandby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-\nbalance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated\nwith the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for\ncommitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our\ndiscretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial\nguarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as\nloans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for\noff-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated\nbalance sheet.\n\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS Other financial assets are evaluated\n\n‘or expected credit losses. These other financial assets include\naccounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-\nsponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage\nAssociation (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage\nCorporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts\nreceivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as\ncentral clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are\ngenerally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss\n\nies (continued)\n\nexpectation (for example, government guarantee) or no\nhistorical credit losses. Some financial assets, such as loans to\nemployees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with\nthe related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our\nconsolidated balance sheet.

We have elected the practical expedient for these\ninancial assets given collateral maintenance provisions.

PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities\nand loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an\nACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach,\nthere is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition;\nrather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial\nasset for the estimate of expected credit losses anda\ncorresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected\ncredit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for\ncredit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income\nrecognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest\nincome recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset.\n\nLeasing Activity\n\nAS LESSOR We lease equipment to our customers under\ninancing or operating leases. Financing leases are presented in\nloans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease\npayments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the\nleased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing\nleases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-\nparty investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual\nlease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that\nwe believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The\nresidual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales\nprice for the equipment at lease termination based on sales\nhistory adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets.\nMany of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at\nprevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at\nlease termination.\n\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers\nboth the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as\nthe estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically\npurchase residual value insurance on our financing leases so that\nour risk of loss at lease termination will be less than 10% of the\ninitial value of the lease. In addition, we have several channels for\nre-leasing or marketing those assets.\n\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s\npurchase of other products or services from the equipment\nvendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use\nof the asset and the purchase of those products or services based\non information obtained from the vendor. Amounts allocated to\ninancing of vendor products or services are reported in loans as\ncommercial and industrial loans, rather than as lease financing.\nOur primary income from financing leases is interest income\nrecognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease\n\n102 Wells Fargo & Company\n", "vlm_text": "collateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of  default, and exposure at default are statistically derived through  historical observations of default and losses after default within  each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as  appropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted  economic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit  commitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to  derive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated  probability of default and loss severity at the time of default are  applied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses  for unfunded credit commitments.   \nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY consumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled  approach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans  within those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that  estimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of  default and exposure at default are typically leveraged to  estimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans,  generally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such  as residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.  As appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further  stratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type,  geographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use  attributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation  (FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the  development of our consumer loan models, in addition to home  price trends, unemployment trends, and other economic  variables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses  in the consumer portfolio.   \nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS    The ACL includes amounts for  qualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our  loss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment  of risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the  ACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level  below our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic  environmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance,  process risk, and other subjective factors, including industry  trends and emerging risk assessments.   \nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES   Our off-balance sheet  credit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally  in the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not  accounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including  standby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off- balance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated  with the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for  commitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our  discretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial  guarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as  loans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for  off-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in  accrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated  balance sheet.   \nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS    Other financial assets are evaluated   for expected credit losses. These other financial assets include  accounts receivable for fees, receivables from government- sponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage  Association (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage  Corporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts  receivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as  central clearing counterparties. Many of these financial assets are  generally not expected to have an ACL as there is a zero loss  \nexpectation (for example, government guarantee) or no  historical credit losses. Some financial assets, such as loans to  employees, maintain an ACL that is presented on a net basis with  the related amortized cost amounts in other assets on our  consolidated balance sheet. Given the nature of these financial  assets, provision for credit losses is not recognized separately  from the regular income or expense associated with these  financial assets.   \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are generally  over-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short- term in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these  financial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These  provisions require that we monitor the collateral value and  customers are required to replenish collateral, if needed.  Accordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these  financial assets.   \nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with  more than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since  their origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated  (PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities  and loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an  ACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach,  there is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition;  rather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial  asset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a  corresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected  credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for  credit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income  recognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest  income recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset.   \nLeasing Activity \nAS LESSOR   We lease equipment to our customers under  financing or operating leases. Financing leases are presented in  loans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease  payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the  leased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing  leases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third- party investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual  lease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that  we believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The  residual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales  price for the equipment at lease termination based on sales  history adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets.  Many of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at  prevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at  lease termination.   \nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers  both the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as  the estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically  purchase residual value insurance on our financing leases so that  our risk of loss at lease termination will be less than  $\\mathtt{10\\%}$   of the  initial value of the lease. In addition, we have several channels for  re-leasing or marketing those assets.   \nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s  purchase of other products or services from the equipment  vendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use  of the asset and the purchase of those products or services based  on information obtained from the vendor. Amounts allocated to  financing of vendor products or services are reported in loans as  commercial and industrial loans, rather than as lease financing.   \nOur primary income from financing leases is interest income  recognized using the effective interest method.

Economic hedges are derivatives we use  to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other risks  associated with our non-trading activities. Customer  accommodation trading and other derivatives primarily  represents derivatives related to our trading business activities.  We report changes in the fair values of these derivatives in  noninterest income.   \nFAIR VALUE HEDGES   We record changes in the fair value of the  derivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a  portion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the  amortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes  in fair value related to the hedged risk with the offset recorded in  earnings. We present derivative gains or losses in the same  income statement category as the hedged asset or liability, as  follows:  \n\n \n•   For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are   reflected in net interest income;  \n\n •   For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing  the fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow   settlements are reflected in noninterest income. The  periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest  income;  \n\n •   For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency  risk, amounts representing the fair value change less the  accrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to  both net interest income and noninterest income. The  periodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest   income.   \nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the  assessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge  relationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency  denominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities  hedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of  these swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes  is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The  initial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net  interest income and the difference between changes in fair value  of the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings  is recorded in OCI.   \nCASH FLOW HEDGES   We record changes in the fair value of the  derivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses  from these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same  period(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the  same income statement category as the hedged item. For cash  flow hedges of interest rate risk associated with floating-rate  commercial loans and long-term debt and for cash flow hedges  of foreign currency risk associated with fixed-rate long-term  debt, these amounts are reflected in net interest income. The  entire gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the  assessment of hedge effectiveness.  \nDOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR  ACCOUNTING HEDGES    For fair value and cash flow hedges  qualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at  inception the relationship between hedging instruments and  hedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our  evaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions.

For cash flow\nhedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic\nchanges in fair value of the hedging instrument against the\nperiodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The\nhypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and\noffset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged\ndue to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for\nair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the\nquantitative measures of the regression results used to validate\nthe conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we\nalso formally assess whether the derivative we designated in\neach hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly\neffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the\nhedged item using the regression analysis method.\n\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly\neffective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a\nhedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or\nexercised, (3) we elect to discontinue the designation of a\nderivative as a hedge, or (4) in a cash flow hedge, a derivative is\nde-designated because it is no longer probable that a forecasted\ntransaction will occur.\n\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting, we no\nlonger adjust the previously hedged asset or liability for changes\nin fair value. The remaining cumulative adjustments to the\nhedged item and accumulated amounts reported in OCI are\naccounted for in the same manner as other components of the\ncarrying amount of the asset or liability. For example, for financial\ndebt instruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term\ndebt, these amounts are amortized into net interest income over\nthe remaining life of the asset or liability similar to other\namortized cost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is\nderecognized, the accumulated amounts reported in OCI are\nimmediately reclassified to net interest income. If the derivative\ncontinues to be held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we\ncarry the derivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair\nvalue with changes in fair value included in noninterest income.\n\nWhen we discontinue cash flow hedge accounting and it is\nprobable that the forecasted transaction will occur, the\naccumulated amount reported in OCI at the de-designation date\ncontinues to be reported in OCI until the forecasted transaction\naffects earnings at which point the related OCI amount is\nreclassified to net interest income. If cash flow hedge accounting\nis discontinued and it is probable the forecasted transaction will\nno longer occur, the accumulated gains and losses reported in\nOCI at the de-designation date is immediately reclassified to\nnoninterest income. If the derivative continues to be held after\ncash flow hedge accounting ceases, we carry the derivative on our\nconsolidated balance sheet at its fair value with changes in fair\nvalue included in noninterest income.\n\nEMBEDDED DERIVATIVES We may purchase or originate financial\ninstruments that contain an embedded derivative. At inception\nof the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic\ncharacteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and\nclosely related to the economic characteristics of the host\n\ncontract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the\nembedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at\nfair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if\na separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded\ninstrument would meet the definition of a derivative. If the\nembedded derivative meets all of these conditions, we separate\nit from the hybrid contract by recording the bifurcated derivative\nat fair value and the remaining host contract at the difference\nbetween the basis of the hybrid instrument and the fair value of\nthe bifurcated derivative. The bifurcated derivative is carried at\nfair value with changes recorded in noninterest income and\nreported within our consolidated balance sheet as a derivative\nasset or liability. The accounting for the remaining host contract\nis the same as other assets and liabilities of a similar type and\nreported within our consolidated balance sheet based upon the\naccounting classification of the instrument.\n\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING By using derivatives,\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that\ncounterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as\nexpected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty\ncredit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset\non our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a\nderivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to\nthe extent subject to legally enforceable master netting\narrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same\ncounterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize\ncounterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits,\nmonitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements\nand obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit\nrisk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value\nand our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent\nderivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the\napplicable requirements, including determining the legal\nenforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present\nderivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on\nour consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to\nreflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments\n(CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA,\nwhich considers the effects of enforceable master netting\nagreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based\nviews of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate\nCVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap\nmarket and indices indicative of the credit quality of the\ncounterparties to our derivatives.\n\nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with\ncentrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the\nderivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to\nseparate non-derivative receivables or payables.

CVA,  which considers the effects of enforceable master netting  agreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based  views of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate  CVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap  market and indices indicative of the credit quality of the  counterparties to our derivatives.  \nCash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate  derivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with  centrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the  derivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to  separate non-derivative receivables or payables.

These securities\nare initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value\nas of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the\nsame or similar security of the same issuer. These securities\nare also adjusted for impairments.\n\nAll realized and unrealized gains and losses, including\nimpairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are\nrecognized in net gains on trading and securities in noninterest\nincome. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity\nsecurities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in\ninterest income.\n\nOur review for impairment for nonmarketable equity\nsecurities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts\nand circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to\nsell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and\nthe viability of its business model. When the fair value of an\nequity method or cost method investment is less than its\ncarrying value, we write-down the asset to fair value when we\nconsider declines in value to be other than temporary. When the\nfair value of an investment accounted for using the\nmeasurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-\ndown the asset to fair value, without the consideration of\nrecovery.\n\nPension Accounting\nWe sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit\nretirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan\n(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of\nWells Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans\nthat provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to\ncertain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit\npension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions\nused in determining the net periodic pension cost and the\npension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-\nterm rate of return on plan assets and projected mortality rates.\nA single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate\nthe present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We\ndetermine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a\nbroad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with\n\nmaturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the\nexpected benefit payments.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we changed the method used to\nestimate the interest cost component of pension expense for our\nprincipal defined benefit and postretirement plans to the full\nyield curve approach. The full yield curve approach aligns specific\nspot rates along the yield curve to the projected benefit payment\ncash flows. This change does not affect the measurement of our\npension obligation as the change in interest cost is offset in the\nactuarial gain (loss). We accounted for this change prospectively\nas a change in estimate to our pension expense. Previously, we\nestimated the interest cost component utilizing a single\nweighted-average discount rate. We made this change to\nimprove the correlation between the yield curve and the\nprojected benefit payment cash flows.\n\nOur determination of the reasonableness of our expected\nlong-term rate of return on plan assets is highly quantitative by\nnature. We evaluate the current asset allocations and expected\nreturns under two sets of conditions: (1) projected returns using\nseveral forward-looking capital market assumptions, and (2)\nhistorical returns for the main asset classes, which allows us to\ncapture multiple economic cycles. We place greater emphasis on\nthe forward-looking return and risk assumptions than on\nhistorical results. We use the resulting projections to derive a\nbaseline expected rate of return and risk level for the Cash\nBalance Plan’s prescribed asset mix.\n\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our\nspecific experience.\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan\niabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting\nactuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial\ngain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from accumulated OCI into\nnet periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining\nparticipation period, which at December 31, 2021, is 19 years.\nSee Note 21 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) for\nadditional information on our pension accounting.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we\noperate and evaluate income tax expense in two components:\ncurrent and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax\nexpense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded\nfor the current period and includes income tax expense related to\nuncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the\nmore likely than not recognition threshold are measured to\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit that\nmanagement believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of\nrealization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our\nrealization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.\n\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes\nin deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the\nbalance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is\nbased on the tax effects of the differences between the book and\ntax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates\nand laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nDeferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s\njudgment that realization is more likely than not.

We use the resulting projections to derive a  baseline expected rate of return and risk level for the Cash  Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix.   \nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables  published by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our  specific experience.   \nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan  liabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting  actuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial  gain or loss in excess of a  $5\\%$   corridor from accumulated OCI into  net periodic pension cost over the estimated average remaining  participation period, which at December 31, 2021, is 19 years.  See Note 21 (Employee Benefits and Other Expenses) for  additional information on our pension accounting.   \nIncome Taxes \nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we  operate and evaluate income tax expense in two components:  current and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax  expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded  for the current period and includes income tax expense related to  uncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the  more likely than not recognition threshold are measured to  determine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax  position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that  management believes has a greater than   $50\\%$   likelihood of  realization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our  realization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits.  \nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet  method and deferred income tax expense results from changes  in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the  balance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is  based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and  tax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates  and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.  Deferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s  judgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation  allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount.   \nSee Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this  Report for a further description of our provision for income taxes  and related income tax assets and liabilities.

Our\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation Plan provides awards for\nemployee services in the form of incentive and nonqualified\nstock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares,\nrestricted share rights (RSRs), performance share awards (PSAs)\nand stock awards without restrictions. Stock options have not\nbeen issued in the last three years and no stock options were\noutstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant\ndate. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual\norfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally\nover the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting\nare expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees\nwho are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to\nimmediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who\nbecome retirement eligible before the final vesting date are\nexpensed between the grant date and the date the employee\nbecomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other\nimited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment\nends.\n\nPSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2019 and 2020 included\ndiscretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are\nmeasured at fair value initially and subsequently until the\ndiscretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated\ncompensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock\nprice. Awards granted in 2021 no longer included these\ndiscretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent\nchanges in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also\nfluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the\nperformance conditions. The total expense that will be\nrecognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of\nthe performance period (the determination of which awards will\nvest is a combination of performance conditions and discretion).\n\nEarnings Per Common Share\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income\napplicable to common stock (net income less dividends on\npreferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over\ncarrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the\nperiod. We compute diluted earnings per common share using\nnet income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of\ncommon stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are\ndilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding\nduring the period.\n\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\n\nWe classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value\nbased upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest\npriority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the\nlowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as\nfollows:\n« Level 1 - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical\n\ninstruments traded in active markets.\n\n« Level 2- Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar\ninstruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nsimilar instruments in markets that are not active, and\nmodel-based valuation techniques for which all significant\nassumptions are observable in the market.\n\ne Level 3-Valuation is generated from techniques that use\nsignificant assumptions that are not observable in the\nmarket. These unobservable assumptions reflect our\nestimates of assumptions that market participants would\nuse in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques\ninclude use of discounted cash flow models, market\ncomparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar\ntechniques.\n\nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to\nassess the appropriate classification of financial instruments\nwithin the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1,\nLevel 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes\nbut is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions.\nChanges in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will\ndrive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes\nin availability of observable market data, which also may result in\nchanging the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of\ntransfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts\nreported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning\nof the quarter in which the transfer occurred.\n\nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more\ndetailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply\nto our assets and liabilities.\n\nFair value represents the price that would be\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an order!\nbetween market participants at the measure\n\nreceived to sell an\nly transaction\nment date. Fair\n\nvalue is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of\nobservable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected\nthe fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure\nrequirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are\nrecorded at fair value ona recurring basis require a fair value\nmeasurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that\nare recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to\nfair value only as required through the application of an\naccounting method such as LOCOM, the measurement\nalternative, or write-downs of individual assets.\n\nWells Fargo & Company 107\n", "vlm_text": "Stock-Based Compensation \nWe have stock-based employee compensation plans as more  fully discussed in Note 19 (Common Stock and Stock Plans). Our  Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan provides awards for  employee services in the form of incentive and nonqualified  stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares,  restricted share rights (RSRs), performance share awards (PSAs)  and stock awards without restrictions. Stock options have not  been issued in the last three years and no stock options were  outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020.  \nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant  date. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual  forfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally  over the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting  are expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees  who are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to  immediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who  become retirement eligible before the final vesting date are  expensed between the grant date and the date the employee  becomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other  limited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment  ends.   \nPSAs and certain RSRs granted in 2019 and 2020 included  discretionary conditions that can result in forfeiture and are  measured at fair value initially and subsequently until the  discretionary conditions end. For these awards, the associated  compensation expense fluctuates with changes in our stock  price. Awards granted in 2021 no longer included these  discretionary conditions and are not adjusted for subsequent  changes in stock price. For PSAs, compensation expense also  fluctuates based on the estimated outcome of meeting the  performance conditions. The total expense that will be  recognized on these awards is finalized upon the completion of  the performance period (the determination of which awards will  vest is a combination of performance conditions and discretion). \nWe classify our assets and liabilities measured at fair value  based upon a three-level hierarchy that assigns the highest  priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the  lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels are as  follows:  \n\n \n•   Level 1 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical  instruments traded in active markets.  \n\n •   Level 2 – Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar  instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and  model-based valuation techniques for which all significant  assumptions are observable in the market.  \n\n •   Level 3 – Valuation is generated from techniques that use  significant assumptions that are not observable in the  market. These unobservable assumptions reflect our  estimates of assumptions that market participants would   use in pricing the asset or liability. Valuation techniques  include use of discounted cash flow models, market  comparable pricing, option pricing models, and similar  techniques.   \nWe monitor the availability of observable market data to  assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments  within the fair value hierarchy and transfers between Level 1,  Level 2, and Level 3 accordingly. Observable market data includes  but is not limited to quoted prices and market transactions.  Changes in economic conditions or market liquidity generally will  drive changes in availability of observable market data. Changes  in availability of observable market data, which also may result in  changing the valuation technique used, are generally the cause of  transfers between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. The amounts  reported as transfers represent the fair value as of the beginning  of the quarter in which the transfer occurred.   \nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) for a more  detailed discussion of the valuation methodologies that we apply  to our assets and liabilities.   \nEarnings Per Common Share \nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income  applicable to common stock (net income less dividends on  preferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over  carrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the  average number of common shares outstanding during the  period. We compute diluted earnings per common share using  net income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of  common stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are  dilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding  during the period.   \nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an  asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction  between market participants at the measurement date. Fair  value is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of  observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we  are required to record them at fair value, when we have elected  the fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure  requirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a  recurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are  recorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value  measurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that  are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to  fair value only as required through the application of an  accounting method such as LOCOM, the measurement  alternative, or write-downs of individual assets.

The table is divided into different categories of securities and each is detailed with the following information: total amortized cost, fair value, and weighted average yield. The table breaks down these figures by total value and also into time periods based on when the securities are expected to mature (within one year, one to five years, five to ten years, and after ten years). \n\nThe categories included are:\n1. Securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies\n2. Non-U.S. government securities\n3. Securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions\n4. Federal agency mortgage-backed securities\n5. Non-agency mortgage-backed securities\n6. Collateralized loan obligations\n7. Other debt securities\n\nFinally, totals for all available-for-sale debt securities are provided at the bottom, with an aggregate weighted average yield of 2.00%."}

The values are expressed in millions of dollars.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the table:\n- **Total:** This represents the overall total for each year. For 2021, it is $5,358 million, and for 2020, it is $7,041 million.\n- **Less: FHA insured/VA guaranteed:** This category shows the amount insured or guaranteed by FHA or VA. For 2021, it is $4,699 million, and for 2020, it is $6,351 million.\n- **Total, not government insured/guaranteed:** This indicates the amount not insured or guaranteed by the government. For 2021, it is $659 million, and for 2020, it is $690 million.\n\n**By Segment and Class (not government insured/guaranteed):**\n- **Commercial:**\n  - *Commercial and industrial:* $206 million in 2021 and $39 million in 2020.\n  - *Real estate mortgage:* $29 million in 2021 and $38 million in 2020.\n  - *Real estate construction:* $0 million in 2021 and $1 million in 2020.\n  - *Total commercial:* $235 million in 2021 and $78 million in 2020.\n\n- **Consumer:**\n  - *Residential mortgage – first lien:* $37 million in 2021 and $135 million in 2020.\n  - *Residential mortgage – junior lien:* $12 million in 2021 and $19 million in 2020.\n  - *Credit card:* $269 million in 2021 and $365 million in 2020.\n  - *Auto:* $88 million in 2021 and $65 million in 2020.\n  - *Other consumer:* $18 million in 2021 and $28 million in 2020.\n  - *Total consumer:* $424 million in 2021 and $612 million in 2020.\n\nFinally, the **Total, not government insured/guaranteed** adds up to $659 million in 2021 and $690 million in 2020, consistent with the sum of the commercial and consumer segments provided.\nTROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS (TDRs)   When, for economic or  legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, we  grant a concession for other than an insignificant period of time  to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider, the related  loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of which totaled   $\\S10.2$   billion and  $\\S14.5$   billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020,  respectively. We do not consider loan resolutions such as  foreclosure or short sale to be a TDR. In addition, COVID-related  modifications are generally not classified as TDRs due to the  relief under the CARES Act and the Interagency Statement. For  additional information on the TDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary  of Significant Accounting Policies) in this Report.   \nWe may require some consumer borrowers experiencing  financial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period  of three to four months, according to the terms of a planned  permanent modification, to determine if they can perform  according to those terms. These arrangements represent trial  modifications, which we classify and account for as TDRs. While  loans are in trial payment programs, their original terms are not  considered modified and they continue to advance through  delinquency status and accrue interest according to their original  terms.  \nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans whose  terms have been modified in a TDR amounted to  $\\mathbb{S}431$   million and  $\\S489$   million at December 31, 2021, and December 31,  2020, respectively.   \nTable 4.14 summarizes our TDR modifications for the  periods presented by primary modification type and includes the  financial effects of these modifications. For those loans that  modify more than once, the table reflects each modification that  occurred during the period. Loans that both modify and are paid  off or written-off within the period, as well as changes in  recorded investment during the period for loans modified in prior  periods, are not included in the table.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE.\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party.\n\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities,\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which\nmay include:\n\n* underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently\nmaking markets in those securities;\n\n* providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees;\n\n* entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;\n\n« holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;\n\n* acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs;\n\n* — providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and\n\n* providing seller financing to VIEs.\n\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and\n\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan\nsale transactions.\n\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored\nentities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain\ncredit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer\nmortgage loans into securitizations pursuant to Government\nNational Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines which are\ninsured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or\nguaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or\nGNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA\ndesign the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the\ninvolved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant\nto the VIE.\n\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option\n\nto repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which\nbecomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments\nremain unpaid by the borrower. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased loans of\n$4.6 billion, $30.3 billion, and $6.3 billion, respectively, which\npredominantly represented repurchases of government insured\nloans. We recorded assets and related liabilities of $107 million\nand $176 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively,\nwhere we did not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans.\n\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual\nrepresentations and warranties, as well as other recourse\narrangements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our liability for\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was $173 million\nand $221 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to\nloss was $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion, respectively.\n\nOff-balance sheet mortgage loans sold or securitized\npresented in Table 8.3 are predominantly loans securitized by the\nGSEs and GNMA.

We\ntypically originate the transferred loans, account for the transfers\nas sales and do not consolidate the VIE. We also typically retain\nthe right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial\ninterests issued by the VIEs, such as debt securities held for\ninvestment purposes. Our servicing role related to\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is\nlimited to primary or master servicer and the most significant\ndecisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally\nmade by the special servicer or the controlling class security\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan\nsecuritizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold\nvariable interests that we consider potentially significant or are\nnot the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets.\n\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We also sell whole loans to\nVIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the\nmost significant activities of the VIEs.\n\nTable 8.1 presents information about transfers of assets during\nthe period for which we recorded the transfers as sales and have\ncontinuing involvement with the transferred assets. In\nconnection with these transfers, we received proceeds and\nrecorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are\nclassified as Level 2.

During the years  ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received   cash flows of  $\\S686$   million,  $\\mathbb{S}^{198}$   million, and   $\\S275$   million,  respectively, related to principal and interest payments on these  securities and loans, which exclude cash flows related to trading  activities and to the sale of our student loan portfolio.  \nTable 8.2 presents the key weighted-average assumptions  we used to initially measure residential MSRs recognized during  the periods presented.   \nThe table presents financial metrics for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019. The metrics include:\n\n1. **Prepayment rate**:\n   - 2021: 13.7%\n   - 2020: 15.4%\n   - 2019: 12.8%\n\n2. **Discount rate**:\n   - 2021: 5.9%\n   - 2020: 6.5%\n   - 2019: 7.5%\n\n3. **Cost to service (in dollars per loan)**:\n   - 2021: $91\n   - 2020: $96\n   - 2019: $101\n\nThe table provides an annual comparison of these rates and costs for the three years.\nRES E CURIT IZ ATION ACTIVITIES    We enter into res e curit iz ation  transactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the  investment and risk management activities of our customers. In  res e curit iz ation transactions, we transfer trading debt securities  to VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to  third parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This  activity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or  risk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the  res e curit iz ation of conforming mortgage-backed securities  issued by the GSEs or GNMA. We do not consolidate the  res e curit iz ation VIEs as we share in the decision-making power  with third parties and do not hold significant economic interests  in the VIEs other than for market-making activities. We  transferred  $\\S39.6$   billion,   $\\S77.2$   billion, and  $\\S27.9$   billion of  securities to re-securitization VIEs during the years ended  December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These  amounts are not included in Table 8.1. Related total VIE assets  were  $\\mathbb{S117.7}$   billion and  $\\S130.4$   billion at December 31, 2021 and  2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we held \n\n  $\\S817$   million and  $\\S1.5$   billion of securities, respectively, including \n\n  $\\S607$   million and  $\\mathbb{S1.1}$   billion related to res e curit iz at ions  transacted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,  respectively.   \nSee Note 17 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) and   Note 9 (Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information  on key economic assumptions for residential MSRs.   \nSALE OF STUDENT LOAN PORTFOLIO   In the year ended  December 31, 2021, we sold   $\\S9.5$   billion of student loans,  servicing-released. For the same period, we received  $\\S9.9$   billion   in proceeds from the sales and recognized  $\\S355$   million of gains,  which are included in other noninterest income on our  consolidated statement of income. In connection with the sales,  we provided  $\\S3.8$   billion of collateralized loan financing to a third- party sponsored VIE, and received cash flows of  $\\S3.8$   billion which  fully repaid these loans. We do not consolidate the VIE as we do  not have power over the significant activities of the entity.   "}

We  are the primary beneficiary of the following structure types:   \nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES   We securitize  dealer floor plan loans and leases in a revolving master trust  entity and hold the subordinated notes and residual equity  interests. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the  key decisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total  VIE assets held by the master trust represent a majority of the  total VIE assets presented for this category in Table 8.5. In a  separate transaction structure, we also provide the majority of  debt and equity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and  leasing to specific vendors and service the underlying collateral.   \nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES    Other VIEs are primarily related to  municipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions and  nonconforming mortgage loan securitizations that we sponsor.  MTOBs are vehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds  through the issuance of short-term debt to investors. Our  \ninvolvement with MTOBs includes serving as the residual interest  holder, which provides control over the key decisions of the VIE,  as well as the remarketing agent or liquidity provider related to  the debt issued to investors. We also securitize nonconforming  mortgage loans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the  underlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities  issued by the VIE.   \nTable 8.5   presents a summary of financial assets and liabilities of  our consolidated VIEs.

They also include certain\nwritten options that require us to make a payment for increases\nin fair value of assets held by the counterparty. These written\noption contracts generally permit or require net settlement.\nWhile these derivative transactions expose us to risk if the option\nis exercised, we manage this risk by entering into offsetting\ntrades or by taking short positions in the underlying instrument.\nWe offset market risk related to options written to customers\nwith cash securities or other offsetting derivative transactions.\nAdditionally, for certain of these contracts, we require the\ncounterparty to pledge the underlying instrument as collateral\nfor the transaction. Our ultimate obligation under written\noptions is based on future market conditions and is only\nquantifiable at settlement. See Note 16 (Derivatives) for\nadditional information regarding written derivative contracts.\n\nLOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE In certain sales and\nsecuritizations of loans, including mortgage loans, we provide\nrecourse to the buyer whereby we are required to indemnify the\nbuyer for any loss on the loan up to par value plus accrued\ninterest. We provide recourse, predominantly to GSEs, on loans\nsold under various programs and arrangements. Substantially all\nof these programs and arrangements require that we share in the\nloans’ credit exposure for their remaining life by providing\nrecourse to the GSE, up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred ona\npro-rata basis in the event of borrower default. Under the\nremaining recourse programs and arrangements, if certain\nevents occur within a specified period of time from transfer date,\nwe have to provide limited recourse to the buyer to indemnify\nthem for losses incurred for the remaining life of the loans. The\nmaximum exposure to loss reported in Table 13.1 represents the\noutstanding principal balance of the loans sold or securitized that\nare subject to recourse provisions or the maximum losses per the\ncontractual agreements. However, we believe the likelihood of\nloss of the entire balance due to these recourse agreements is\nremote, and amounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part\nfrom the sale of collateral. We also provide representation and\nwarranty guarantees on loans sold under the various recourse\nprograms and arrangements. Our loss exposure relative to these\nguarantees is separately considered and provided for, as\nnecessary, in determination of our liability for loan repurchases\ndue to breaches of representation and warranties.\n\nEXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES We are members\nof several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing\nhouses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we\nuse to clear our trades and those of our customers. It is common\nthat all members in these organizations are required to\ncollectively guarantee the performance of other members and of\nthe organization. Our obligations under the guarantees are\ngenerally a pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a\nmultiple of the guarantee fund we are required to maintain with\nthese organizations. Some membership rules require members\nto assume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another\nmember’s default or from non-member default losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. We have not recorded a liability for\nthese arrangements as of the dates presented in Table 13.1\nbecause we believe the likelihood of loss is remote.\n\nOTHER GUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS We have\ncontingent performance arrangements related to various\ncustomer relationships and lease transactions. We are required\nto pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties\ndefault on certain obligations.\n\nUnder certain factoring arrangements, we may be required\nto purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable\ndebtors default on their payment obligations.\n\nWe use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle\ntransactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage\ncustomers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that\ncould occur for non-performance by our customers on\ntransactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions\nsubject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations\nrelated to the settlement of margin accounts and short\npositions, such as written call options and securities borrowing\ntransactions.\n\nWe enter into other types of indemnification agreements in\nthe ordinary course of business under which we agree to\nindemnify third parties against any damages, losses and\nexpenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings\narising from relationships or transactions with us. These\nrelationships or transactions include those arising from service as\na director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements\nrelating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various\nother business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent\nof our obligations under these agreements depends entirely\nupon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to\ndetermine our potential future liability under these agreements.\nWe do, however, record a liability for residential mortgage loans\nthat we expect to repurchase pursuant to various\nrepresentations and warranties.\n\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in\nconnection with payment and delivery disputes between the\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the\ncardholder.

These obligations are included in\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as\noff-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has\nnot recognized a separate liability for these guarantees.\n\nThe Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the\npayment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may\nbe due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary,\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The\nguaranteed liabilities were $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These guarantees\nrank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist\nprimarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate\nand distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the\nParent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt\nsecurities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on\nthe Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds\nrom its subsidiaries.

The amount of our unfunded\ncontractual commitments was $11.0 billion and $12.0 billion as\nof December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nGiven the nature of these commitments, they are excluded\nfrom Table 4.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 4\n(Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).\n\nWells Fargo & Company 149\n", "vlm_text": "GUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES    In the normal course of business,  the Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related  to its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in  the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as  off-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has  not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees.   \nThe Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees the  payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that may  be due on securities that its  $100\\%$   owned finance subsidiary,  Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not  guaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The  guaranteed liabilities were  $\\S1.2$   billion and  $\\S2.3$   billion at  December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These guarantees  rank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and  unsubordinated indebtedness. The assets of the Parent consist  primarily of equity in its subsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate  and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. As a result, the  Parent’s ability to address claims of holders of these debt  securities against the Parent under the guarantee depends on  the Parent’s receipt of dividends, loan payments and other funds  from its subsidiaries. If any of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes  insolvent, the direct creditors of that subsidiary will have a prior  claim on that subsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the  rights of the Parent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim  unless the Parent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary. For  additional information regarding other restrictions on the  Parent’s ability to receive dividends, loan payments and other  funds from its subsidiaries, see Note 28 (Regulatory Capital  Requirements and Other Restrictions).   \nOTHER COMMITMENTS    To meet the financing needs of our  customers, we may enter into commitments to purchase debt  and equity securities to provide capital for their funding, liquidity  or other future needs. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020,  we had commitments to purchase debt securities of  $\\S18$   million   and commitments to purchase equity securities of  $\\S2.4$   billion   and  $\\S3.2$   billion, respectively.   \nAs part of maintaining our memberships in certain clearing  organizations, we are required to stand ready to provide liquidity  to sustain market clearing activity in the event unforeseen  events occur or are deemed likely to occur. Certain of these  obligations are guarantees of other members’ performance and  accordingly are included in Table 13.1 in Other guarantees and  indemnifications.  \nAlso, we have commitments to purchase loans and securities  under resale agreements from certain counterparties, including  central clearing organizations. The amount of our unfunded  contractual commitments was  $\\mathbb{S11.0}$   billion and   $\\S12.0$   billion as  of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.   \nGiven the nature of these commitments, they are excluded  from Table 4.4 (Unfunded Credit Commitments) in Note 4   (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses).

Plaintiffs allege that the Visa\nand MasterCard requirement that if an ATM operator charges an\naccess fee on Visa and MasterCard transactions, then that fee\ncannot be greater than the access fee charged for transactions\non other networks, violates antitrust rules. Plaintiffs seek treble\ndamages, restitution, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees where\navailable under federal and state law. Two other antitrust cases\nthat make similar allegations were filed in the same court, but\nthese cases did not name Wells Fargo as a defendant. On\nFebruary 13, 2013, the district court granted defendants’\nmotions to dismiss the three actions. Plaintiffs appealed the\ndismissals and, on August 4, 2015, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the district\ncourt’s decisions and remanded the three cases to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. On June 28, 2016, the United\nStates Supreme Court granted defendants’ petitions for writ of\ncertiorari to review the decisions of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia.

In July 2017,\nthe Company announced a plan to remediate customers who\nmay have been financially harmed due to issues related to\nautomobile CPI policies purchased through a third-party vendor\non their behalf. Multiple putative class actions alleging, among\nother things, unfair and deceptive practices relating to these CPI\npolicies, were filed against the Company and consolidated into\none multi-district litigation in the United States District Court\nfor the Central District of California. As previously disclosed, the\nCompany entered into a settlement to resolve the multi-district\nlitigation. Shareholders also filed a putative securities fraud class\naction against the Company and its executive officers alleging\nmaterial misstatements and omissions of CPl-related\ninformation in the Company’s public disclosures.

In the underlying first-party actions,\nNomura and Natixis have been sued for alleged breaches of\nrepresentations and warranties made in connection with\nresidential mortgage-backed securities sponsored by them. In\nthe third-party actions, Nomura and Natixis allege that\n\nWells Fargo, as master servicer, primary servicer or securities\nadministrator, failed to notify Nomura and Natixis of their own\nbreaches, failed to properly oversee the primary servicers, and\nfailed to adhere to accepted servicing practices. Natixis\nadditionally alleges that Wells Fargo failed to perform default\noversight duties. Wells Fargo has asserted counterclaims alleging\nthat Nomura and Natixis failed to provide Wells Fargo notice of\ntheir representation and warranty breaches.\n\nOFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The Company has self-identified\nan issue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo\nsoftware-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related\nfinancing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by\nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States\nDepartment of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related\nto these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as\na result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company has made\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and is cooperating with an\ninquiry from the United States Department of Justice\n(Department of Justice).\n\nRETAIL SALES PRACTICES MATTERS Federal and state government\nagencies, including the Department of Justice and the United\nStates Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), have\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations arising\nout of certain retail sales practices of the Company that were the\nsubject of settlements with the CFPB, the OCC, and the Office of\nthe Los Angeles City Attorney announced by the Company on\nSeptember 8, 2016. On February 21, 2020, the Company entered\ninto an agreement with the Department of Justice to resolve the\nDepartment of Justice’s criminal investigation into the\nCompany’s retail sales practices, as well as a separate agreement\nto resolve the Department of Justice’s civil investigation. As part\nof the Department of Justice criminal settlement, no charges will\nbe filed against the Company provided the Company abides by all\nthe terms of the agreement. The Department of Justice criminal\nsettlement also includes the Company’s agreement that the\n\n‘acts set forth in the settlement document constitute sufficient\n‘acts for the finding of criminal violations of statutes regarding\nbank records and personal information. On February 21, 2020,\nthe Company also entered into an order to resolve the SEC’s\ninvestigation arising out of the Company’s retail sales practices.\nThe SEC order contains a finding, to which the Company\nconsented, that the facts set forth include violations of Section\nO(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5\nthereunder. As part of the resolution of the Department of\nJustice and SEC investigations, the Company made payments\ntotaling $3.0 billion. The Company has also entered into\nagreements to resolve other government agency investigations,\nincluding investigations by the state attorneys general. In\naddition, a number of lawsuits were filed by non-governmental\nparties seeking damages or other remedies related to these retail\nsales practices. As previously disclosed, the Company entered\ninto various settlements to resolve these lawsuits.\n\nWells Fargo & Company\n\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF\nLimited and certain related entities and the National Credit Union\nAdministration (NCUA) filed complaints in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Southern District of New York against\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., alleging claims against the Company in its\ncapacity as trustee for a number of residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising similar allegations\nhave been filed by Commerzbank AG in the Southern District of\nNew York and by IKB International and IKB Deutsche\nndustriebank in New York state court. In each case, the plaintiffs\nallege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to\ninvestors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based upon,\namong other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to notify and\nenforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for\npurported breaches of representations and warranties, notify\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate\nstandards of care following alleged events of default. The\nCompany previously settled two class actions with similar\nallegations that were filed in November 2014 and December\n2016 by institutional investors in the Southern District of New\nYork and New York state court, respectively. In addition, Park\nRoyal | LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed complaints that were\nconsolidated in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A,, as trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning\nof defective mortgage loan documentation. In March 2021, the\nCompany entered into an agreement to resolve the case filed by\nthe NCUA.\n\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that\nWells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with\nthe administration of a minor's trust and failed to invest the\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. In\nDecember 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the\namended complaint on the grounds that the Tribe is a necessary\nparty and that the individual beneficiaries lack standing to bring\nclaims. The motion was denied in June 2018. The case is pending\ntrial.\n\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals\nor legal actions when potential losses associated with the\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible\npotential losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable\nand estimable losses was approximately $2.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2021. The outcomes of legal actions are\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is\ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or\neven possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the\namount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable.\nAccordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on\ninformation currently available, advice of counsel, available\ninsurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo\nbelieves that the eventual outcome of the actions against\n\nWells Fargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s\nconsolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the\nultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material\nto Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.\n\n155\n", "vlm_text": "NOMURA/NATIXIS MORTGAGE-RELATED LITIGATION   In August  2014 and August 2015, Nomura Credit & Capital Inc.

The “embedded” derivative  is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a  derivative. Additionally, we may invest in hybrid instruments that  contain embedded derivatives, such as credit derivatives, that are  not clearly and closely related to the host contract. In such  instances, we either elect fair value option for the hybrid  instrument or separate the embedded derivative from the host  contract and account for the host contract and derivative  separately.

{"page": 184, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_WFC_2021_184.jpg", "ocr_text": "DERIVATIVES Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring\nbasis. The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives, which\ninclude certain equity option contracts, are primarily measured\nusing available quoted market prices. The fair value of non-\nexchange-traded derivatives, which predominantly relate to\nderivatives traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, are\nmeasured using internal valuation techniques, as quoted market\nprices are not always readily available. Valuation techniques and\ninputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and\nnature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value\nof the derivative is based. Key inputs can include yield curves,\ncredit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates,\nvolatility measurements and correlation of certain of these\ninputs.\n\nEQUITY SECURITIES Marketable equity securities and certain\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account\nfor at fair value are recorded at fair value ona recurring basis. Our\nremaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for\nusing the equity method, cost method or measurement\nalternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value\nadjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying\nvalue of equity securities accounted for under the measurement\nalternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence\nof orderly observable transactions of the same or similar\nsecurities of the same issuer.\n\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded.\nQuoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable\nequity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally\nmarket comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value\nfor such securities. We use all available information in making this\ndetermination, which includes observable transaction prices for\nthe same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing\nservices, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public\ncompanies, and discounted cash flow models. Where\nappropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to\nreflect the comparative differences between the market data\nand the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with\npublic companies and other investment-specific considerations\nlike liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the\ninstruments.\n\nOTHER ASSETS Although other assets are generally recorded at\namortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to\nreflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications.\nOther assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements\ninclude operating lease ROU assets and foreclosed assets. Fair\nvalue is generally based upon independent market prices or\nappraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash\nflow model.\n\nLiabilities\n\nSHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES Short-sale trading liabilities in\nour trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring\nbasis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets,\nwhere available. When quoted prices for the same instruments\nare not available or markets are not active, fair values are\nestimated using recent trades of similar securities.\n\nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes\n\nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and\nliabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices\nobtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending\non which approach is utilized.\n\nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value\nestimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash\nflow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the\ninputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable\ninputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic\nperformance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in\nsimilar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be\nimplied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to\nhistorical experience and other third-party data where available.\n\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include\nmodel validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are\nappropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist\nto help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation\nassesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models,\nincluding reviewing its key components, such as inputs,\nprocessing components, logic or theory, output results and\nsupporting model documentation. Validation also includes\nensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate\ngiven observable market transactions or other market data\nwithin the same or similar asset classes.\n\nWe also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our\nLevel 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models.\nThese procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable\nassurance that models continue to perform as expected, include:\n* — ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions\n\nand other independent market data (including pricing\n\nvendors, if available);\n\n* — back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized\ntransactions; and\n\n¢ — review of modeled valuation results against expectations,\nincluding review of significant or unusual fluctuations in\nvalue.\n\nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model\nrevalidations as necessary.\n\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function\nand monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management.\nIndependent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function,\nprovides independent oversight of model risk management, and\nits responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review,\nand monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing\nperiodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk\nCommittee.\n\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS We routinely obtain pricing\nfrom third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In\ncertain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities\nthat we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve\nand periodically review third-party vendors to ensure information\nobtained and valuation techniques used are appropriate. This\nreview may consist of, among other things, obtaining and\nevaluating control reports issued and pricing methodology\nmaterials distributed. We monitor and review vendor prices on an\nongoing basis to ensure the fair values are reasonable and in line\nwith market experience in similar asset classes. While the inputs\nused to determine fair value are not provided by the pricing\nvendors, and therefore unavailable for our review, we perform\none or more of the following procedures to validate the pricing\ninformation and determine appropriate classification within the\nfair value hierarchy:\n\n* comparison to other pricing vendors (if available);\n\nWells Fargo & Company 165\n", "vlm_text": "DERIVATIVES   Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring  basis. The fair value of exchange-traded derivatives, which  include certain equity option contracts, are primarily measured  using available quoted market prices. The fair value of non- exchange-traded derivatives, which predominantly relate to  derivatives traded in over-the-counter (OTC) markets, are  measured using internal valuation techniques, as quoted market  prices are not always readily available. Valuation techniques and  inputs to internal models depend on the type of derivative and  nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the value  of the derivative is based. Key inputs can include yield curves,  credit curves, foreign exchange rates, prepayment rates,  volatility measurements and correlation of certain of these  inputs.  \nEQUITY SECURITIES   Marketable equity securities and certain  nonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account  for at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our  remaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for  using the equity method, cost method or measurement  alternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value  adjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying  value of equity securities accounted for under the measurement  alternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence  of orderly observable transactions of the same or similar  securities of the same issuer.   \nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of  marketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded.  Quoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable  equity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally  market comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value  for such securities. We use all available information in making this  determination, which includes observable transaction prices for  the same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing  services, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public  companies, and discounted cash flow models. Where  appropriate, we make adjustments to observed market data to  reflect the comparative differences between the market data  and the attributes of our equity security, such as differences with  public companies and other investment-specific considerations  like liquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the  instruments.   \nOTHER ASSETS    Although other assets are generally recorded at  amortized cost, we record nonrecurring fair value adjustments to  reflect impairments or the impact of certain lease modifications.  Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements  include operating lease ROU assets and foreclosed assets. Fair  value is generally based upon independent market prices or  appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a discounted cash  flow model.   \nLiabilities  \nSHORT-SALE TRADING LIABILITIES   Short-sale trading liabilities in  our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring  basis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets,  where available. When quoted prices for the same instruments  are not available or markets are not active, fair values are  estimated using recent trades of similar securities.   \nLevel 3 Asset and Liability Valuation Processes \nWe generally determine fair value of our Level 3 assets and  liabilities by using internal models and, to a lesser extent, prices  obtained from vendors. Our valuation processes vary depending  on which approach is utilized.   \nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS   Certain Level 3 fair value  estimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash  flow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the  inputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable  inputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic  performance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in  similar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be  implied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to  historical experience and other third-party data where available.   \nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our  model risk management policies and procedures, which include  model validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are  appropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist  to help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation  assesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models,  including reviewing its key components, such as inputs,  processing components, logic or theory, output results and  supporting model documentation. Validation also includes  ensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate  given observable market transactions or other market data  within the same or similar asset classes.  \nWe also have ongoing monitoring procedures in place for our  Level 3 assets and liabilities that use internal valuation models.  These procedures, which are designed to provide reasonable  assurance that models continue to perform as expected, include:  \n\n •   ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions  and other independent market data (including pricing  vendors, if available);  \n\n •   back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized   transactions; and  \n\n •   review of modeled valuation results against expectations,  including review of significant or unusual fluctuations in  value.   \nWe update model inputs and methodologies periodically to   reflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing  models are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model  revalidations as necessary.   \nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by  the appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function  and monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management.   Independent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function,  provides independent oversight of model risk management, and  its responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review,  and monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing  periodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk  Committee.   \nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS   We routinely obtain pricing  from third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In  certain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities  that we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve  and periodically review third-party vendors to ensure information  obtained and valuation techniques used are appropriate. This  review may consist of, among other things, obtaining and  evaluating control reports issued and pricing methodology  materials distributed. We monitor and review vendor prices on an  ongoing basis to ensure the fair values are reasonable and in line  with market experience in similar asset classes. While the inputs  used to determine fair value are not provided by the pricing  vendors, and therefore unavailable for our review, we perform  one or more of the following procedures to validate the pricing  information and determine appropriate classification within the  fair value hierarchy:   \n•   comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); "}

In determining the end of year\nbenefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of\napproximately 7.50% for health care costs in 2022. This rate is\nassumed to trend down 0.30%-0.40% per year until the trend\nrate reaches an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2030.

The Cash Balance Plan\ncurrently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the\nfollowing ranges: 75%-85% fixed income, 10%-20% equities, and\n0%-10% in real estate, private equity and other investments. The\nEmployee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes\nseveral members of senior management, formally reviews the\ninvestment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan ona\nquarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/\nliability evaluations are also conducted.\n\n182\n\nOther benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h)\ntrust, which are invested with a target mix of 50%-60% equities\nand 40%-50% fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree\nMedical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association\n(VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income\nsecurities and cash.

These metrics are broken down into categories for qualified and non-qualified pension benefits, as well as other benefits.\n\n### December 31, 2021\n- **Pension Benefits:**\n  - Qualified: \n    - Discount Rate: 2.63%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 2.68%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 5.17%\n  - Non-qualified:\n    - Discount Rate: 2.32%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 1.08%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: Not Applicable (N/A)\n- **Other Benefits:**\n  - Discount Rate: 2.31%\n  - Interest Crediting Rate: N/A\n  - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 3.50%\n\n### December 31, 2020\n- **Pension Benefits:**\n  - Qualified:\n    - Discount Rate: 2.95%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 2.68%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 5.74%\n  - Non-qualified:\n    - Discount Rate: 3.12%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 1.46%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: N/A\n- **Other Benefits:**\n  - Discount Rate: 3.10%\n  - Interest Crediting Rate: N/A\n  - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 4.00%\n\n### December 31, 2019\n- **Pension Benefits:**\n  - Qualified:\n    - Discount Rate: 4.30%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 3.22%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 6.24%\n  - Non-qualified:\n    - Discount Rate: 4.10%\n    - Interest Crediting Rate: 2.05%\n    - Expected Return on Plan Assets: N/A\n- **Other Benefits:**\n  - Discount Rate: 4.24%\n  - Interest Crediting Rate: N/A\n  - Expected Return on Plan Assets: 5.75%\n\nThe table highlights the trend of decreasing discount rates and expected returns on plan assets over the three-year span. The interest crediting rate remains constant for qualified pension benefits between 2021 and 2020, while data for non-qualified benefits indicates a decrease.\nTo account for postretirement health care plans, we used  health care cost trend rates to recognize the effect of expected  changes in future health care costs due to medical inflation,  utilization changes, new technology, regulatory requirements  and Medicare cost shifting. In determining the end of year  benefit obligation, we assumed an average annual increase of  approximately 7.50% for health care costs in 2022. This rate is  assumed to trend down  $0.30\\%–0.40\\%$    per year until the trend  rate reaches an ultimate rate of  $4.50\\%$   in 2030. The 2021  periodic benefit cost was determined using an initial annual trend  rate of   $7.80\\%$  . This rate was assumed to decrease  $0.30\\%–0.40\\%$    per year until the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of  $4.50\\%$   in  2030.   \nInvestment Strategy and Asset Allocation \nWe seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a  prudent level of risk, given the benefit obligations of the pension  plans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is  designed to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate  amount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that  risk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset  classes and various investment strategies, coupled with an  investment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally  designed to approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash  Balance Plan’s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan  currently has a target asset allocation mix comprised of the  following ranges:  $75\\%–85\\%$   fixed income,  $10\\%–20\\%$   equities, and   $0\\%–10\\%$   in real estate, private equity and other investments. The  Employee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes  several members of senior management, formally reviews the  investment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a  quarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/   liability evaluations are also conducted.   \nOther benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h)  trust, which are invested with a target mix of  $50\\%–60\\%$   equities  and  $40\\%–50\\%$   fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree  Medical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association  (VEBA) trust, which are predominantly invested in fixed income  securities and cash. Members of the EBRC formally review the  investment risk and performance of these assets on a quarterly  basis.   \nProjected Benefit Payments \nFuture benefits that we expect to pay under the pension and  other benefit plans are presented in Table 21.7.  \nThe table shows projected pension and other benefits in millions of dollars for the years ending December 31. It includes three categories: \"Qualified,\" \"Non-qualified,\" and \"Other benefits.\"\n\n- **2022**: \n  - Qualified: $859 million \n  - Non-qualified: $44 million \n  - Other benefits: $38 million\n\n- **2023**: \n  - Qualified: $734 million \n  - Non-qualified: $42 million \n  - Other benefits: $36 million\n\n- **2024**: \n  - Qualified: $690 million \n  - Non-qualified: $41 million \n  - Other benefits: $34 million\n\n- **2025**: \n  - Qualified: $696 million \n  - Non-qualified: $39 million \n  - Other benefits: $33 million\n\n- **2026**: \n  - Qualified: $694 million \n  - Non-qualified: $38 million \n  - Other benefits: $31 million\n\n- **2027-2031**: \n  - Qualified: $3,284 million \n  - Non-qualified: $161 million \n  - Other benefits: $135 million"}

(the Bank).   \nTable 28.1 presents regulatory capital information for  Wells Fargo & Company and the Bank in accordance with Basel III  capital requirements. We must calculate our risk-based capital  ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches.  The Standardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to  broad risk categories, while the calculation of risk-weighted  assets (RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by requiring  applicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which  relies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an  operational risk component. The Basel III capital requirements for  calculating Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and tier 1 capital, along  with RWAs, are fully phased-in. However, the requirements for  determining tier 2 and total capital remained in accordance with  transition requirements at December 31, 2021, but became fully  phased-in beginning January 1, 2022.

Notably, the standardized and advanced approaches show slightly different capital figures and ratios, reflecting different calculations or risk assessments. The table also distinguishes between the parent company (Wells Fargo & Company) and its subsidiary (Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.).\nAt December 31, 2021, under transition requirements, the  CET1, tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the Company  included a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge  of  $2.00\\%$  .

A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and  knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment  encompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to  estimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable  forecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for  qualitative factors that may not be captured in the loss models. The assessment also included an evaluation of the conceptual  soundness and performance of certain credit loss models. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of  audit evidence obtained.   \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested  the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the measurement of the ACL estimate, including controls over  the:  \n\n \n•   development of certain credit loss models  \n\n •   continued use and appropriateness of changes made to certain credit loss and economic forecasting models  \n\n •   performance monitoring of certain credit loss and economic forecasting models  \n\n •   identification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain credit loss and economic forecasting models  \n\n •   development of the qualitative factors, including significant assumptions used in the measurement of certain qualitative   factors \n\n •   analysis of the ACL results, trends, and ratios.   \nWe evaluated the Company’s process to develop the estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the  Company used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors, and assumptions.
