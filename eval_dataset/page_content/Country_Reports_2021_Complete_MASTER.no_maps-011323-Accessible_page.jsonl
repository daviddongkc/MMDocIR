Both CT- focused prosecutors and judges have begun using plea agreements in proceedings.   \nCT functions are divided among the three branches of the National Police Service:  1) the Kenya  Police Service (including the paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU); the Traffic Police; and  the regional, county, and local police); 2) the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (including  the investigative Antiterrorism Police Unit, the Bomb Disposal Unit, and the Cyber Forensics  Investigative Unit); and 3) the Administration Police (including the Border Police Unit).     \nThe National Intelligence Service, elements of the KDF, and the interagency also shared  responsibility for CT functions.  Uneven coordination, resource constraints, insufficient training,  corruption, and unclear command and control continue to hinder CT effectiveness.  Kenya’s  National Counter terrorism Center (NCTC) continued to work with private security companies on  preventing soft target attacks.  Kenya’s interagency Joint Terrorism Task Force began operations  and made its first arrest on November 13.   \nKenyan officials continued to work to secure the nation’s porous land borders to prevent terrorist  exploitation, but hurdles remain.  While aviation safety and security at Nairobi’s international  airport and at several points of entry have improved with the establishment of Joint Operations  Centers, watchlist screening and basic equipment at smaller ports of entry were generally  lacking.   \nThe Kenyan government worked to prevent the transit of foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs),  including Kenyans attempting to join AS or ISIS, and those returning from abroad.  Kenyan  security services also detected and deterred terrorist plots and responded to dozens of terrorism- related incidents.  The Kenyan government cooperated on threat information and security at  Embassy Nairobi, including through a dedicated GSU CT response team funded by the United  States.   \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Kenya is a member of the Eastern and Southern  Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG).  Kenya helped host a regional  counter terrorism financing (CTF) meeting in Nairobi in November, during which Kenyan  officials explored expanding CTF collaboration with their Djiboutian and Somali counterparts.   \nCountering Violent Extremism:   The NCTC’s County Action Plans for CVE in all 47 counties  continue to be the primary framework for U.S. and other international CVE programming at the  local level, but implementation of action plans in many counties remained hampered by a lack of  funding.  Police in Nairobi, coastal, and northeastern counties participated in community  engagement training and early warning and response programs.  Prison and justice sector  stakeholders improved handling of terrorist suspects and convicts, and judicial officials worked  to improve management of remand prisoners through plea bargaining and other methods.   Kenya’s second largest city, Mombasa, is an active member of the Strong Cities Network.   "}

The Ministry of Defense also supported VPSHR,  signaling an increase in government support for the initiative throughout 2021.   "}

In light of these concerns,\nSenegal continued to work closely with foreign partners, including U.S. military and law\nenforcement officials, to strengthen its CT capabilities.\n\nThe risk of terrorist activity in Senegal arises primarily from the growing terrorist threats and the\nprevalence of multiple active terrorist groups across the region, combined with political\ninstability in neighboring Mali and Guinea. These factors increase the risk that extremism and\naccompanying instability could spill across the border into Senegal. Senegal has taken steps to\ncombat this threat by contributing troops to MINUSMA and establishing new military and\ngendarmerie camps along its eastern border. Internally, there are secondary risks with the\npromotion of “extremist ideologies” by a small number of religious leaders; however, these\nideologies remain outside Senegal’s prevailing Islamic norms.\n\n2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in Senegal in 2021.\n\nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: There were no significant changes to\nSenegal’s CT legal framework in 2021. Senegal continued to enhance the capabilities of its\nInterministerial Framework for Intervention and Coordination of CT Operations (CICO). CICO,\nformed in 2016, is designed to coordinate the government’s response to terrorism.\n\nSenegal’s second-ever special terrorism court session, held March 17 to April 8, resolved six\ncases involving nine defendants, including a returning fighter, a young French radical, two\nMalian financiers, and three Mauritanians with alleged connections to the masterminds of the\n2016 Grand-Bassam attack in Cote d’Ivoire. The trial evidence revealed no alarming uptick in\nradicalization or insurgent activity within Senegal’s borders. At the same time, the case results\nshowed that much work remains.

In light of these concerns,  Senegal continued to work closely with foreign partners, including U.S. military and law  enforcement officials, to strengthen its CT capabilities.  \nThe risk of terrorist activity in Senegal arises primarily from the growing terrorist threats and the  prevalence of multiple active terrorist groups across the region, combined with political  instability in neighboring Mali and Guinea. These factors increase the risk that extremism and  accompanying instability could spill across the border into Senegal.  Senegal has taken steps to  combat this threat by contributing troops to MINUSMA and establishing new military and  gendarmerie camps along its eastern border.  Internally, there are secondary risks with the  promotion of “extremist ideologies” by a small number of religious leaders; however, these  ideologies remain outside Senegal’s prevailing Islamic norms.  \n2021 Terrorist Incidents:   There were no reported terrorist incidents in Senegal in 2021.   \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   There were no significant changes to  Senegal’s CT legal framework in 2021.  Senegal continued to enhance the capabilities of its  Inter ministerial Framework for Intervention and Coordination of CT Operations (CICO).  CICO,  formed in 2016, is designed to coordinate the government’s response to terrorism.   \nSenegal’s second-ever special terrorism court session, held March 17 to April 8, resolved six  cases involving nine defendants, including a returning fighter, a young French radical, two  Malian financiers, and three Mauritanians with alleged connections to the masterminds of the  2016 Grand-Bassam attack in Cote d’Ivoire.  The trial evidence revealed no alarming uptick in  radicalization or insurgent activity within Senegal’s borders.  At the same time, the case results  showed that much work remains.  Five of the nine defendants were acquitted, two by agreement  of the prosecutor, which suggests inadequate investigations and insufficient evidence.  Moreover,  all nine of the defendants — including those ultimately acquitted — waited as many as five years  in pretrial detention before their cases were heard.  Those convicted received five-year prison  terms and stiff financial penalties.  \nSenegal’s gendarmerie and national police have specialized units to detect, deter, and prevent  acts of terrorism.

In December, Malaysia’s central bank  (Bank Negara Malaysia, or BNM) announced preliminary findings from the National Risk  Assessment 2020 (NRA 2020), prepared by the National Coordination Committee to Counter  Money Laundering.  The NRA 2020 identified fraud, illicit drugs trafficking, corruption, bribery,  organized crime, and smuggling as crimes posing the highest risk of money laundering activity  in Malaysia.  The NRA 2020 also identified environmental crimes (e.g., wildlife trafficking,  illegal mining) and cyber-enabled extortion as posing an “elevated risk” for money-laundering  activities.  BNM reported in December that the Malaysian Financial Intelligence Network,  established in 2019 to facilitate information sharing between financial institutions and law  enforcement agencies, has processed 44 cases related to terrorism financing, proliferation  financing, corruption, and securities offenses to date.  \nCountering Violent Extremism:   In 2021, the Southeast Asia Regional Center for  Counter terrorism (SEARCCT) actively promoted a whole-of-society approach in preventing and  countering violent extremism.  These efforts included capacity building workshops with media  professionals and civil society organizations to enhance their potential to analyze and report on  terrorism trends and contribute to CVE efforts.  SEARCCT also initiated its own podcast on  counter terrorism narratives to encourage youth engagement.  Episodes have been broadcast in  both Malay and English.  On regional cooperation, SEARCCT hosted training programs on  border protection against terrorism in partnership with the Australian government and held  advanced courses on open-source intelligence in collaboration with the United Nations Counter- Terrorism Centre and Counter-Terrorism Committee Executive Directorate.  As part of the  annual Malaysian Technical Cooperation Program, SEARCCT organized an online seminar on  youth and terrorism for participants of 13 countries.  The center also hosted other fora and  webinars on contemporary issues such as terrorism financing.    "}

Albanian criminal-justice officials participated regularly in  various regional associations, conferences, and other counter terrorism information-sharing  exchanges.  \nAUSTRIA \nOverview:   U.S.-Austrian law enforcement cooperation remained strong.  U.S. law enforcement  agencies continued to assist in investigations of the 2020 terrorist attack in Vienna, during which  a 20-year-old Austrian of North Macedonia origin killed four persons and injured 23 others.   Parliament passed additional counter terrorism legislation, including on Hizballah, providing  additional funding of   $\\S137$   million for 2021-24, and   $\\S5.8$   million to fight cybercrime.  Parliament  also passed legislation to reform the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and  Counter terrorism, Austria’s key counter terrorism agency within the Interior Ministry, and  replaced it December 1 with the Directorate for Security and Intelligence (DSN).  \nReforms included increased staffing of the agency’s “extremism” section and hiring more highly  qualified personnel.  DSN’s new chief said in late 2021 that “radical elements” exploiting  protests against COVID-19 restrictions constituted one of Austria’s top security concerns.  Other  counter terrorism raids and investigations focused on “Islamist extremism,” alleged members of  the Muslim Brotherhood, and the “right-wing extremist scene,” which promoted anti-Muslim  and antimigrant violence.  Austrian courts continued to impose stiff prison sentences for  convicted “Islamist terrorists.”  \nThe DSN monitors an estimated 90 people who returned to Austria from conflict zones, and the  Interior Ministry estimated at the end of 2021 that 100 Austrian FTFs were still in Syria and  Iraq.  Overall, Austrian officials note that “Islamist terrorist” mobilization substantially declined  after 2015.  \nAustria is a member of the Defeat-ISIS Coalition’s Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Stabilization  working groups, with emphases on stabilization, the problem of FTFs, and countering violent  extremism.  Law enforcement agencies focused on intelligence gathering and investigations, as  well as on sharing information with international partners.  Austria has contributed significant  humanitarian aid and separate funding for stabilization related to Defeat-ISIS efforts.  Austria  maintains an embassy in Damascus (the ambassador is accredited to Lebanon and Syria and  based in Beirut, traveling periodically to Damascus).  \n2021 Terrorist Incidents:   There were no reported terrorist incidents in Austria in 2021.   Investigations continued into the aforementioned 2020 terrorist attack in Vienna by the 20-year- old Austrian of North Macedonian origin.  Police killed the attacker.  Since the attack,  investigators determined the terrorist acted alone but received encouragement from four ISIS  sympathizers, and he received material support, including assistance obtaining ammunition, from  three others.  Authorities are holding these seven accomplices in pretrial detention.   \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   Parliament passed sweeping  counter terrorism legislation in 2021 in response to that 2020 terrorist attack.

Denmark was also a contributor to the Global Community Engagement and  Resilience Fund.  \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   Much of Denmark’s multilateral engagement to  prevent and combat terrorism is guided by the UN’s Global Counter terrorism Strategy, which  was most recently revised in June.  Denmark continued to strongly support counter terrorism  efforts in regional and multilateral organizations, including the Global Counter terrorism  Forum, NATO, the Council of Europe, the OSCE, INTERPOL, Club de Berne, and the  European Counter terrorism Center.  Denmark also is among the founding members of the  Defeat-ISIS Coalition and is in the Foreign Terrorist Fighter, Counter-ISIS Finance,  Stabilization, and Communications Working Groups.  Denmark continued to lead the NATO  Mission Iraq in 2021.  Throughout 2021, Denmark continued to contribute personnel to the  UN peacekeeping mission in Mali and the French-led counter terrorism mission in the Sahel.   Denmark also contributed troops to the NATO-led Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan  before withdrawing in June.  \nFRANCE \nOverview:   France is a key partner of the United States in the global fight against terrorism.   Bilateral U.S.-France counter terrorism cooperation is strong.  France is a longstanding and  important member of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  \nThe terrorist threat in France remained high.  Security services were concerned by lone-actor  attacks carried out by individuals already in France, including those inspired by or affiliated  with ISIS.  French officials also were concerned by right-wing extremists able to form cells  and organize attacks.  The government adopted new laws to enhance the government’s  ability to tackle what it described as Islamist separatism, and to make permanent some of the  security measures temporarily imposed under the State of Emergency following the 2015  terrorist attacks.  French law enforcement and intelligence agencies thwarted at least five  attacks in 2021 and arrested at least 50 individuals, including 19 linked to REMVE actors.  \n2021 Terrorist Incidents:   At least two suspected terrorist attacks took place in 2021, with  limited casualties:   \n•   On April 23, a Tunisian national stabbed and killed a police employee while shouting  “Allāhu ’akbar” outside a police station in a suburb of Paris.  Police shot and killed  him.  The National CT Prosecutor’s Office is investigating the case.    "}

North Macedonia is a member of MONEYVAL, a Financial Action  Task Force (FATF)-style regional body.  Its Financial Intelligence Unit, the Financial  Intelligence Office (FIO), is a member of the Egmont Group.  The government drafted a  new law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing to implement the  provisions of Directive V (2018/843) and harmonize it with EU legislation.  The new draft  law incorporates articles aimed at overcoming risks identified in the 2020 National Risk  Assessment on terrorism financing of non-profit organizations and implements FATF  recommendations.  In August, the government adopted a new National Strategy for  Prevention of Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (2021-24).   \nIn 2021, the FIO received five reports for suspicion of terrorist financing from banks, and it  submitted 11 total reports on suspicion of terrorist financing to competent authorities for  "}

Serbia continued efforts to counter terrorism and cooperate with the United\nStates and international partners.\n\n2021 Terrorist Incidents: There were no reported terrorist incidents in 2021.\n\nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security: Serbia’s Ministry of Interior has a\nCounterterrorism Service (the CT Service), which includes a Department for Preventing and\nCombating Extremism. Serbia’s Criminal Code criminalizes terrorism-related offenses,\nincluding international terrorism, incitement, recruitment, using a deadly device, destruction\nand damage to a nuclear facility, terrorist financing, and terrorist association. Amendments\nto the Criminal Code in 2019 introduced life imprisonment for acts of terrorism resulting in\ndeath and extended the application of terrorist financing to other crimes. The code also\noutlaws unauthorized participation in a foreign war or armed conflict, prescribing\nincarceration from six months to 10 years for such activities. Serbia has sentenced\nindividuals for participating in terrorist-related activities in Syria and for participating in the\nRussia-Ukraine conflict in eastern Ukraine. The CT Service reported that of the 10 Serbian\nFTFs who have returned to Europe from Syria or Iraq, four returned to Serbia. Serbia\nprosecuted seven such FTFs (some in absentia), for a total of 69 years of sentencing,\naccording to the CT Service. According to some NGOs and investigative outlets,\nprosecutors dealing with such cases reportedly apply different standards, with returnees\nfrom Syria facing up to 11-year sentences under terrorism-related offenses and returnees\nfrom Ukraine receiving suspended sentences for participation in a foreign armed conflict.\nThe CT Service responded that the Criminal Code allows only those convicted of fighting\nwith UN-designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS, may be prosecuted for terrorism-related\noffenses. Serbians fighting with pro-Russia groups in Ukraine — not designated as terrorist\ngroups by the UN — were prosecuted for participation in a foreign armed conflict,\naccording to the CT Service. Serbia lacks legislation that more broadly covers conduct\nrelated to receiving terrorist training, funding terrorist organizations, and terrorist\nrecruitment activities.\n\nAlthough UNSCR 2396 calls on member states to develop systems to screen PNR data,\ncurrently API and PNR screening programs are not in place in Serbia, although data Serbian\nairlines are required to transmit to the United States and other governments is collected and\nhandled by third-party data vendors.

Serbia continued efforts to counter terrorism and cooperate with the United  States and international partners.    \n2021 Terrorist Incidents:   There were no reported terrorist incidents in 2021.  \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   Serbia’s Ministry of Interior has a  Counter terrorism Service (the CT Service), which includes a Department for Preventing and  Combating Extremism.  Serbia’s Criminal Code criminalizes terrorism-related offenses,  including international terrorism, incitement, recruitment, using a deadly device, destruction  and damage to a nuclear facility, terrorist financing, and terrorist association.  Amendments  to the Criminal Code in 2019 introduced life imprisonment for acts of terrorism resulting in  death and extended the application of terrorist financing to other crimes.  The code also  outlaws unauthorized participation in a foreign war or armed conflict, prescribing  incarceration from six months to 10 years for such activities.  Serbia has sentenced  individuals for participating in terrorist-related activities in Syria and for participating in the  Russia-Ukraine conflict in eastern Ukraine.  The CT Service reported that of the 10 Serbian  FTFs who have returned to Europe from Syria or Iraq, four returned to Serbia.  Serbia  prosecuted seven such FTFs (some  in absentia ), for a total of 69 years of sentencing,  according to the CT Service.  According to some NGOs and investigative outlets,  prosecutors dealing with such cases reportedly apply different standards, with returnees  from Syria facing up to 11-year sentences under terrorism-related offenses and returnees  from Ukraine receiving suspended sentences for participation in a foreign armed conflict.   The CT Service responded that the Criminal Code allows only those convicted of fighting  with UN-designated terrorist groups, such as ISIS, may be prosecuted for terrorism-related  offenses. Serbians fighting with pro-Russia groups in Ukraine — not designated as terrorist  groups by the UN — were prosecuted for participation in a foreign armed conflict,  according to the CT Service.  Serbia lacks legislation that more broadly covers conduct  related to receiving terrorist training, funding terrorist organizations, and terrorist  recruitment activities.  \nAlthough UNSCR 2396 calls on member states to develop systems to screen PNR data,  currently API and PNR screening programs are not in place in Serbia, although data Serbian  airlines are required to transmit to the United States and other governments is collected and  handled by third-party data vendors.  Serbia in 2020 pledged, as part of the Washington  Commitments, to implement information sharing agreements with the United States and to  strengthen screening measures.  Serbia is integrating with the European Common Aviation  Area and cooperates with international partners to enhance capacities in accordance with  UNSCR 2309.  \nAccording to NGOs there were at least 26 family members of Serbian FTFs in Syria, while  the CT Service reported that 27 Serbian national adults are currently in Syria, among whom  are family members of FTFs.  There were no indications that Serbia repatriated any of these  individuals.  Some NGOs and local communities claimed Serbia was unwilling to repatriate  its nationals from Syria.  International organizations reported that Serbia was establishing  local reintegration teams and drafting bylaws to eventually receive repatriated citizens.  "}

Algeria also hosted and participated in  various Sahelian-Saharan fora to discuss development and security policies and the evolution of  regional terrorism.  Regional tensions between Morocco and Algeria remained an impediment to  bilateral and regional CT cooperation.  \nBAHRAIN \nOverview:   There were no successful terrorist attacks in Bahrain in 2021, but domestic security  forces conducted numerous operations to preempt and disrupt attack planning.  On February 6,  Ministry of Interior security forces thwarted a plot to detonate explosives at two National Bank  of Bahrain automated teller machines (ATMs) in the al-Naim and Jidhafs areas in Manama.  In  September, four individuals were arrested for setting fire to a Bahrain National Bank ATM; the  Ministry of Interior also accused them of being funded by the Iran-based al-Wafa group.  \nThe Government of Bahrain is a member of the Riyadh-based Terrorist Financing Targeting  Center (TFTC) and supports U.S. government counter terrorism efforts.  Bahrain hosts the U.S.  Navy’s Fifth Fleet and the U.S. Naval Forces Central Command and participates in U.S.-led  military coalitions, including the International Maritime Security Construct and the Counter  Maritime Task Force.  Bahrain continued to offer support for countering Iran’s malign activities  in the region.  The Government of Bahrain initiated numerous programs intended to improve  relations between the community and security forces.   "}

While this decrease was partially attributable to greater movement restrictions  imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, it also reflected a general downward trend in certain  violence indicators since 2016, such as deaths of Israelis, deaths of Palestinians, and terrorist  attacks in the West Bank.  However, these figures do not account for settler violence against  Palestinians and their property, which increased over the last year.  \nHamas, a U.S.-designated FTO and Specially Designated Global Terrorist, maintained de facto  control over Gaza in 2021.  Hamas and several militant groups, including Sunni violent  extremist groups such as PIJ, launched an estimated 4,400 rocket attacks against Israel from  Gaza.  Hamas and its affiliates launched incendiary balloons and devices toward Israel,  damaging farms and nature preserves.  Hamas and PIJ tunneling activities continued.  Live  ammunition from Hamas’s anti-aircraft weapons struck buildings in Israel.  \n2021   Terrorist Incidents:   Terrorist incidents during the year included the following:  \n•   On May 2, assailants in a passing vehicle shot and injured three Israelis near Tapuach  Junction/Za’tara Checkpoint south of Nablus, then fled the scene.  One of the victims,  Yehuda Guetta, died as a result of his injuries.  Israeli authorities set up checkpoints,  resulting in clashes with youths during which five were shot.  Medics said the three  persons injured in the attack were men in their late teens or early 20s.  They were taken  to Petah Tikva’s Beilinson Hospital for treatment.  The perpetrator of the drive-by  shooting attack was a U.S. citizen, Muntassir Shalabi, according to media reports.  The  Shin Bet did not believe he had any affiliation with Palestinian terror groups.  He was  arrested four days after the attack, and later sentenced to two life sentences.    •   On August 21, a Palestinian militant from Gaza approached a border post and shot an  IDF soldier at point-blank range during Hamas-organized border clashes in which  several Palestinians were also killed.  The soldier later succumbed to his wounds.  •   On September 30, a 30-year-old Palestinian woman attempted to stab police officers at  the Chain Gate entrance to HAS/TM, according to press reports.

The leading terrorist threat was Houthi  cross-border attacks, some of which the United States has described as terrorism, which more  than doubled in 2021.  As in previous years, Saudi Arabia was a full partner and active  participant in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS and provided significant operational and  logistical support to Coalition activities.  \nTerrorist Incidents:   Houthi cross-border attacks, some of which the United States has  described as terrorism, surpassed 400 in 2021, more than double the number of attacks in  2020.  Incidents included the use of ballistic and cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems,  unmanned surface vessels, and floating mines.  Significant cross-border incidents in 2021  included the following:    \n•   On February 10, shrapnel from a Houthi attack on Abha International Airport caused a  fire on a civilian aircraft and injured 12 people.  •   On March 2, a Houthi drone attack against Jizan injured five civilians and caused  damage to several buildings.   •   On August 30 a Houthi drone attack on Abha airport wounded eight civilians and  damaged the airport and a commercial airliner.  •   On September 4 a Houthi complex drone and missile attack in the Eastern Province  resulted in injuries to two children and damage to 14 private residences.  •   On October 8 a Houthi drone injured 10 civilians after it struck a commercial airport in  Jizan.  \nOn March 30, a man was arrested at Masjid al-Haram, the Great Mosque of Mecca, after  brandishing a weapon and shouting terrorist slogans.  No injuries were reported.  Separately,  "}

The government continued to implement its five-year  (2018-22) program against “religious extremism” and terrorism, but NGOs and independent  observers expressed concerns that terrorism and “extremism” laws were applied broadly, in some  cases against political opponents and adherents of non-violent religious movements.    \n2021 Terrorist Incidents:   There were no reported terrorist incidents in Kazakhstan in 2021.    \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   Kazakhstan has a comprehensive CT  legal framework.  The lead CT agency is the Committee for National Security (KNB), which  coordinates efforts at both the central and local levels.  The government approved an ambitious  five-year,   $\\S900$   million program in 2018 to counter religious extremism and terrorism.  Law- enforcement officers and prosecutors continued to have wide discretion to determine what  qualifies as terrorism or extremism.  President Tokayev signed amendments into law in  December abolishing the death penalty, including for terrorism-related crimes.    \nKazakhstani law bans its citizens from fighting in foreign wars.  The government has taken a  two-pronged approach to citizens returning from Iraq and Syria, prosecuting fighters and those  suspected of active participation in terrorism while allowing others to reintegrate into their  communities, where they have access to state-supported theological counseling and  "}

Officially, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reports the detention of 136 suspects  under the PTA in 2021 while civil society organizations report that more than 300 detentions  remain.

At year’s end, 11 organizations were jointly contributing to the BRAC.  \nSri Lanka conducted two rounds of Border Security Roundtables with the U.S. Department of  State.  The discussions focused on the potential implementation of PISCES, INTERPOL  connectivity, and the Watchlisting Assistance and Support Program.  \nThere were several reports of ex-LTTE cadres trafficking drugs and weapons, with some  officials alleging those instances were efforts to resuscitate the LTTE despite the lack of  evidence pointing toward organized, coordinated efforts to revive the organization.  The recovery  of arms, ammunition, and explosives in the Northern and Eastern Provinces where the LTTE was  active received enhanced media coverage.  In December, authorities recovered 190,755 rounds  of ammunition from a workshop in Paranthan, Kilinochchi District.    \nAuthorities identified a group called the Tamil Eelam Cyber Force that has been hacking  government and private websites in Sri Lanka.  The Terrorism Investigation Division arrested  two suspects in Jaffna for alleged online promotion of the LTTE.

Panama also has an executive decree to address chemical, biological,  radiological, and nuclear incidents.  While the country does not have a formal coordinating  authority on migration below the cabinet level, officials from the GoP’s National Security  Council, National Border Service (SENAFRONT), National Migration Service (SNM), and  National Police (PNP) met frequently among themselves and with U.S. government officials to  efficiently coordinate and act on migration alerts and detain and deport travelers who represented  a security risk.  Panama furthered its UNSCR 2396 obligations to collect biographic and  biometric data, share information with regional partners, share advance passenger information,  and participate in INTERPOL.   \nA U.S.-Panamanian Joint Task force that shares information on Known and Suspected Terrorists  (KSTs) and detains and/or deports them as needed cooperated on several CT-related cases.  The  task force continued to process Panama’s BITMAP data and provide intelligence information,  analytical products, and migration trends to Panamanian officers.  The GoP’s biometric  enrollments provide U.S. agencies with information on foreign partners’ law enforcement and  border encounters with KSTs, gang members, and other persons of interest.  \nThe Ministry of Security and the National Customs Authority (ANA) made progress to address  the country’s lack of cargo scanners.  At the time of this report, the scanners project was in the  final stages of approval, with a late 2022 anticipated delivery, leaving the ANA to rely heavily  on just three Customs and Border Protection/Crime Scene Investigation scanners operating at the  ports of Colón and Balboa.    The lack of scanners significantly limits the GoP’s ability to analyze  cargo transiting the country, including at Tocumen International Airport — which has the highest  number of passenger movements in the region — and entry to and exit from the Colón Free  Trade Zone.  Limited scanner capabilities, along with a lack of proper institutional and  interagency protocols at ports, greatly increases the risk of illicit cargo transiting undetected to  and through Panama.  Current GoP efforts, supported by Embassy Panama City, will increase  interagency information sharing and expand situational awareness in the land, air, and maritime  border security environments.   \nPanama continued to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement on ongoing counter terrorism cases  this year, including investigations of individuals linked to Hizballah.  However, the GoP’s ability  to investigate financial support to terrorist-related organizations remained limited.   \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Panama belongs to the Latin American Financial  Action Task Force.

Sudan’s extensive and porous borders and physical location continue to make the  country a potential gateway for linking violent extremist activities in the region.  Though Sudan  has in general endeavored to tighten its border control measures, continued illicit and  unmonitored movement across the borders is likely.  The results of the autumn counter terrorism  raids surfaced primarily foreign terrorists, speaking to terrorists’ continued ability to use Sudan  as a logistical and facilitation hub.  \nThe government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD  in or through its territory.  \nSoutheast Asia \nThe Southern Philippines.   The Philippine government closely tracked terrorist groups that  continued to operate in some areas, particularly in the southern Philippines.  The government  sustained aggressive military and law enforcement operations to deny safe haven to such groups  and prevent the flow of FTFs through its territory.  The government further deepened close  counter terrorism cooperation with the United States, enhancing military and law enforcement  efforts to address the full spectrum of terrorist threats, including from WMD.  \nAlthough the Philippine government possesses the political will to apply security measures  against terrorist threats and has consistently partnered with the United States and other nations to  build the capacity to do so, it is still working to apply a coordinated whole-of-government  approach to counter terrorism and prevent the Philippines from being used as a terrorist safe  haven.  The continued ability of terrorist organizations to operate in the southern Philippines  reflects the centuries-long challenge of governing effectively in the country’s more remote areas  and of establishing consistent security in a region characterized by a strong separatist identity,  endemic poverty, and religious differences.  \nThe government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD  in or through its territory.

They continued engaging in terrorist and other criminal activities, particularly in  border regions and areas previously controlled by the FARC.  \nThe ELN perpetrated armed attacks across the country in 2021.  The government was not known  to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD in or through its territory.  \nCuba.   Cuba, citing peace negotiation protocols, refused Colombia’s request to extradite 10 ELN  leaders living in Havana after that group claimed responsibility for the 2019 bombing of the  national police academy in Bogotá, killing 22 people and injuring 87 others.  During 2019,  Colombia filed extradition requests for ELN leaders Victor Orlando Cubides (aka Pablo Tejada)  and Israel Ramírez Pineda (aka Pablo Beltrán) with the Cuban government, to which Cuba has  not acceded.  \nCuba also harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on charges of political violence,  many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades.  For example, the Cuban government has  refused to return Joanne Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur, a fugitive on the FBI’s Most Wanted  Terrorists List, who was convicted of executing New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.   Cuba also has refused to return William “Guillermo” Morales, a fugitive bomb maker for the  Armed Forces for National Liberation (or FALN), who is wanted by the FBI and escaped  detention after being convicted of charges related to domestic terrorism; Ishmael LaBeet, aka  Ishmael Muslim Ali, who received eight life sentences after being convicted of killing eight  persons in the U.S. Virgin Islands in 1972 and hijacking a plane to flee to Cuba in 1984; and  Charles Lee Hill, who has been charged with the 1971 killing of New Mexico State Policeman  Robert Rosenbloom.  The Cuban government provides housing, food ration books, and medical  care for fugitives residing there.  \nIn 2021 the Department of State designated Cuba a State Sponsor of Terrorism, citing, in part,  the continued presence of ELN negotiators.  \nThe government was not known to support or facilitate the proliferation or trafficking of WMD  in or through its territory.

In 2021, this  initiative examined how to improve information sharing between and among  governments on topics such as KSTs transitioning through official ports, the use of ships  and small vessels as weapons, and the smuggling or trafficking of narcotics or arms  through subregional workshops focused on West Africa, East Africa, and East Asia  Pacific’s tri-maritime border (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines) culminating in the  adoption of the  Maritime Addendum to the New York Memorandum  in October.  •   ‘Initiative on Criminal Justice Responses to the Linkages Between Terrorism,  Transnational Organized Crimes, and International Crimes.’   In 2021 the GCTF  Criminal Justice and Rule of Law Working Group held virtual workshops to examine the  links between terrorism and international crimes, which resulted in the adoption of the  GCTF Memorandum on Criminal Justice Approaches to the Linkages Between Terrorism  and Core International Crimes, Sexual and Gender-Based Violence Crimes, Crimes,  Human Trafficking, Migrant Smuggling, Slavery, and Crimes Against Children  in  October.

In January, it issued a draft revision of the Europol Regulation that would\nallow, for the first time, Europol to establish lookouts in the EU’s Schengen Information System\nfor use by EU border and police authorities. The regulation is expected to be adopted by the\nCouncil and Parliament in 2022. In June the Regulation on Addressing the dissemination of\nterrorist content online entered into force, requiring service providers operating in the EU to\nremove content within one hour of notification by a competent authority in the EU. Also in\nJune, the Commission published its Strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen\nArea, outlining plans to improve border management within the EU. In December it proposed an\nupdate to the Priim Decision that would further codify cross-border law enforcement cooperation\nin EU law and establish a consistent, EU-operated technical infrastructure for the exchange of\ndata under Priim. This step, if approved, will bring Priim, first adopted in 2006, more in line\nwith the EU’s recent interoperability efforts. Despite these improvements, the EU’s constantly\nevolving data privacy framework also continues to make law enforcement and border security\ncooperation between EU member states and non-EU countries, including the United States, more\nchallenging.\n\nInternationally, the EU Council adopted a decision in October launching a European Union\nTraining Mission (EUTM) in Mozambique to counter terrorism in the northern province of Cabo\nDelgado.

In January, it issued a draft revision of the Europol Regulation that would  allow, for the first time, Europol to establish lookouts in the EU’s Schengen Information System  for use by EU border and police authorities.  The regulation is expected to be adopted by the  Council and Parliament in 2022.  In June the Regulation on Addressing the dissemination of  terrorist content online entered into force, requiring service providers operating in the EU to  remove content within one hour of notification by a competent authority in the EU.  Also in  June, the Commission published its  Strategy towards a fully functioning and resilient Schengen  Area,  outlining plans to improve border management within the EU.  In December it proposed an  update to the Prüm Decision that would further codify cross-border law enforcement cooperation  in EU law and establish a consistent, EU-operated technical infrastructure for the exchange of  data under Prüm.  This step, if approved, will bring Prüm, first adopted in 2006, more in line  with the EU’s recent interoperability efforts.  Despite these improvements, the EU’s constantly  evolving data privacy framework also continues to make law enforcement and border security  cooperation between EU member states and non-EU countries, including the United States, more  challenging.  \nInternationally, the EU Council adopted a decision in October launching a European Union  Training Mission (EUTM) in Mozambique to counter terrorism in the northern province of Cabo  Delgado.  The EUTM became fully operational in December, with 84 military personnel (from  EU member states) providing training in two centers.  The two-year program is funded by the  European Peace Facility to train 11 companies of Mozambican marines and commandos to serve  as a quick reaction force to terrorist threats.  The EU also continued six military and law  enforcement capacity building missions in the Horn of Africa, the Central African Republic, and  the Sahel, working closely with U.S. elements in counter terrorism, border security, and  stabilization efforts.  To date, the EU has pledged almost   $\\S270$   million for the G-5 Sahel Joint  Force, a coalition of five West African nations providing border security and counter terrorism  operations in the Sahel.  The EU has also initiated the Partnership for Stability and Security in  the Sahel to assess the security sector in West African countries and coordinate donor funding to  fulfill their needs.  \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

Under the Swedish chairmanship, the  OSCE in April held its annual OSCE-wide Counter terrorism Conference as a virtual/in-person  hybrid event.

Counter terrorism support strengthened security at airports and land borders,  augmenting security for direct flights to the United States.  CT programs also supported  multilateral efforts to strengthen law enforcement and build CVE capabilities.  Recipient law  enforcement organizations have used the skills and assistance to crack down on terrorists  globally and save hundreds of lives from planned attacks.  \nRewards for Justice \nThe Department of State’s national security rewards program, Rewards for Justice (RFJ), was  established by the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, Public Law 98-533 (codified at  22 U.S.C.   $\\S~2708)$  ).  Rewards for Justice is managed by the Diplomatic Security Service.
