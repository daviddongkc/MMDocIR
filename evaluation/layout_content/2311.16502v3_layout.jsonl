Therefore, numerous all-round benchmarks have been established to assess different facets of LMMs. These benchmarks cover a wide spectrum of specific skills of LMMs, from Optical Character Recogni- tion (OCR) as seen in the study by [ 37 ], to adversarial ro- bustness [ 68 ] and hallucination [ 13 ,  32 ], e.g., POPE [ 30 ] and HaELM [ 54 ].

We adopt micro-averaged accuracy as the evaluation metric. For both open and multiple-choice questions, we design systematic, rule-based evaluation pipelines. Specifically, to mitigate the potential influence of any intermediate generations (e.g., reasoning steps, cal- culations) in the long response, we construct robust regular expressions and develop response-processing workflows. These are employed to extract key phrases, such as num- bers and conclusion phrases, from the long responses for accurate answer matching. If there is no valid answer in the model’s response, we perform random selection as a rem- edy for multiple-choice questions or consider the response incorrect for open questions.

This was achieved by several devices, including water-filled moats and barbicans, high stone walls surrounding the castle. Another such device was battlements (or c re nell at ions). These were alternating sections of wall, called merlons, and openings, called embrasures. The embrasures were used for firing arrows. They also permitted boulders to be dropped on attackers attempting to scale the castle walls.

The normal pressure in the left atrium is usually around  $10\\:\\mathrm{mm\\:Hg},$   while the pressure in the left ventricle during systole (contraction) can go up to   $120~\\mathrm{mm~Hg}$   or more and during diastole (relaxation) drops significantly. The given pressure for the left ventricle is  $165/45\\:\\mathrm{mm\\:Hg},$   which is significantly high during systole. Meanwhile, the pressure in the  ascending aorta is   $155/70\\ \\mathrm{mm\\Hg},$   which is closer to normal systolic pressure but has an elevated  diastolic pressure. These findings indicate that blood is flowing back from the left ventricle to the left atrium during ventricular systole, which is consistent with mitral regurgitation. During mitral regurgitation, the mitral valve doesn't close tightly, allowing blood to flow backward in the heart. This can cause symptoms like palpitations and can be associated with a heart murmur on physical examination. Thus, the most likely diagnosis based on the provided data is: (B) Mitral regurgitation.

Given the choices provided and the context of Symbolic Interactionism, the most appropriate answer is: (B) Master status. Master status refers to a social position that is the primary identifying characteristic of an individual. It dominates other statuses and thereby determines a person's general position in society. In the context of crime, some symbolic interaction is ts might argue that an individual's master status (e.g., being labeled as a \"criminal\") could influence their interactions and how they are perceived by others in society.

The Green shields model relates speed (u) and density (k) using the equation:    $u=u_{m a x}-u_{m a x}/k_{j a m}{\\times k},$   where    $u_{m a x}$   is the maximum speed (which occurs when density   $\\mathbf{k}$   is zero) and    $k_{j a m}$   is the jam density. From this equation, we can derive a linear relationship:    $u=u_{m a x}-u_{m a x}/k_{j a m}{\\times}k$  . If we rearrange the terms, it looks like:    $u=-{{u}_{m a x}}/{{k}_{j a m}}\\times$   $k+u_{m a x}$  .Here, the term  $-u_{m a x}/k_{j a m}$   is the slope of the line, and  $u_{m a x}$   is the y-intercept. We'll now use the data provided to determine the slope and y-intercept using regression analysis, from which we can then derive  $k_{j a m}$  . Let's compute the regression parameters: Given data points: Speed (u): 14.2, 24.1, 30.3, 40.1, 50.6, 55.0; Density (k): 85, 70, 55, 41, 20, 15.

By comparing this to the Green shields model equation, we can deduce:  $u=$   $-\\,u_{m a x}/k_{j a m},c=u_{m a x}.$  . From the given data:  $u_{m a x}=55.0$  (from the highest speed value). Using the above equation for m:    $k_{j a m}=-u_{m a x}/u$  . Once we determine the slope m using the regression analysis, we can solve for    $k_{j a m}$  . For the purpose of this exercise, I will not be calculating the slope using the regression formula directly (as that would be computationally intensive), but based on the linear relationship implied by the data, the jam density    $k_{j a m}$   would be slightly greater than the highest density value provided   $(85~\\mathrm{{vech/km})}$  .

Step 1: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall a vertical distance of   $\\mathrm{(26m-16m)=}10\\mathrm{m}$   after clearing the obstruction at B. Using the equation:    $\\begin{array}{r}{s={\\frac{1}{2}}g t^{2}.}\\end{array}$  , where    $s$  is the vertical displacement   $=$   $10\\mathrm{m},\\,g$  is the acceleration due to gravity  $=9.81\\mathrm{m/s}$  , and the falling time  ${\\approx}1.428s$  . Step 2: Determine the horizontal distance covered in this time. This is the distance from A to the point right before the obstruction at B. Given that the total horizontal distance is  $40\\mathrm{m},$  , the distance from A to just before B is  $40\\mathrm{m}$  . Step 3: Determine the time it takes for the rock to fall   $26\\mathrm{m}$   from A. Using the equation:    $s=$   ${\\scriptstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}}g t^{2}.$  , where  $s=26\\mathrm{m,\\Omega}$  , we obtain    $t\\approx2.302s$  . Step 4: Using time from Step 3, determine the horizontal distance the rock covers from  $\\mathrm{A=}40\\mathrm{m}$  . Step 5: Equating the expressions for  $u$  from Step 2 and Step 4, Solving for width we get: width  $\\approx\\,17.469\\mathrm{m}$  . Plugging this into the equation from Step 2:    $u\\approx$   $15.775\\mathrm{\\bar{m}/\\mathrm{s}}$  . But we made a mistake. When the rock just clears the obstruction, it doesn‘t have a vertical velocity of 0. In fact, its vertical velocity    $v$  when it clears the obstruction at B is given by:  $v^{2}=u^{2}-2g s\\dot{v^{2}}=u^{2}-2g s,$  , where  $s=10\\mathrm{m}$  .
