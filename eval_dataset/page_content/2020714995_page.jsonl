It is also used to track the  spread of the virus through geo-localization. Its use is not mandatory, except for  travelers entering the country and those exempted from the lockdown and returning  to work.   \nI.  Introduction  \nArgentina declared a state of health emergency due to the COVID-19 epidemic for one year  through the Decree of Necessity and Urgency [DECNU] 260/2020 starting on March 12, 2020.  It  further mandated a lockdown through DECNU 297/2020, until March 31, 2020, which was  extended until May 24, 2020.  The lockdown was to remain in place in Buenos Aires through at  least June 7.   \nThere were 9,931 Covid-19 cases in Argentina as of May 22, 2020, and 419 deaths, according to  the report from the government, which is updated daily.  This information is available in a New  COVID-19 dedicated section in the Ministry of Health website, where all information,  recommendations, FAQs, etc., are available.   \nOf a population of almost 45 million,  there are approximately 40 million mobile phone users in  Argentina, and 1.3 million users have already downloaded and used the government app  CuidAR COVID-19, which is managed by the Ministry of Health and aimed at the protection and  care of citizens against the COVID-19 pandemic.   No survey results on Argentinians’ willingness  to share personal data were located.  "}

Data Retention Requirements   \nThe TIA Act includes data retention provisions under which telecommunications companies are  required to “retain a particular set of telecommunications data for at least 2 years.” 44  The required  data involves information about communications, such as when an email was sent and the  relevant email addresses, rather than the content or substance of communications.  The Act  specifically requires the retention of information regarding “[t]he location of equipment, or a line,  used in connection with a communication.” 46  Service providers are required to protect the  confidentiality of such information by encrypting it and protecting it from unauthorized  interference or access.    \nEnforcement agencies, including state and territory police, may access telecommunications data  for criminal law enforcement purposes and for the enforcement of laws imposing a pecuniary  penalty.  Service providers may also voluntarily disclose such data when reasonably necessary  for the enforcement of criminal law.   "}

Privacy Concerns\n\nAs per the head of this project, Arnab Kumar, the app was built to the standards of the draft data\nprivacy bill, which is currently in the country’s parliament, and “access to the data it collects is\nstrictly controlled.” ®!

As of May 22,  2020, a total of 441 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Taiwan, including seven  deaths, out of a population of almost 24 million.    \nA highly tech-savvy democracy, Taiwan is believed to have implemented the first phone-based  tracking system to enforce quarantine in the current pandemic.   It began working on the system,  described as a “digital fence,” as early as in late January 2020, a week after Taiwan recorded its  first imported case of the novel coronavirus from China.  Although there have been concerns  over data privacy, the public opinion in general firmly supports the government in its handling  of the pandemic. A telephone poll conducted in mid-February by the Taiwanese Public Opinion  Foundation found that people on average gave the government a score of 84 points out of 100 for  its epidemic response.  In terms of smartphone usage, over   $98\\%$   of the Taiwanese population  owned smartphones as of 2019.    "}

Processing of personal data 18  according to the  GDPR must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose  limitation; data minimization; accuracy and keeping data up to date; storage limitation; and  integrity and confidentiality.  Article 6 of the GDPR sets out the conditions under which data  processing is considered lawful, with the most common ground being consent given by the data  subject.    "}

Consent of the User  \nFurthermore, the Commission points out that contact tracing and warning apps generally require  the storage of information on the device. According to the ePrivacy Directive, storing information  or gaining access to information already stored on a device requires either consent of the user or  must be necessary to provide the service.  The Commission explains that as the user may need  to upload proximity data, which is not necessary for the operation of the app as such, consent is  required.  Consent according to the GDPR is only valid if it is freely given,  specific, informed,   and an unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she signifies  agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.  That means that silence,  pre-ticked boxes (checked by default), or inactivity do no constitute valid consent.  Furthermore,  withdrawing consent needs to be as easy as giving consent.  The EDPB issued guidelines in May  2020 that provide more details on the requirements for valid consent.   \nd.   Processing for Reasons Other than Consent  \nThe GDPR also allows processing of personal data when it is necessary to comply with a legal  obligation to which the controller is subject or when such processing is necessary for the  performance of a task carried out to further the public interest.  The Commission states that  national laws that were already in place before the COVID-19 pandemic or laws enacted or  amended in response to it can provide a valid legal basis for processing personal data in a mobile  app if they meet the requirements of the GDPR.  The legal obligation or public interest task must  be codified in either EU law or Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that legal  basis must identify the purpose of the processing or the processing must be necessary for the  performance of the task.  Furthermore, the legal basis must “meet an objective of public interest  and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.” 79  In the opinion of the Commission, a  generic purpose of “prevention of further COVID-19 infections” is not specific enough for an app  with contact tracing and warning functionalities. Instead, it proposes “retaining of the contacts of  the persons who use the app and who may have been exposed to infection by COVID-19 in order  to warn those persons who could have been potentially infected.” 80   "}

Privacy and Data Protection \nThe French Civil Code provides that all people have a right to privacy.  However, data protection  in France is primarily governed by the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR),  and by the domestic Loi Informatique et Libertés (Law on Information  Technology and Freedoms).  The latter was originally adopted in 1978, but has been amended  many times since. For example, it was amended in 2004 to incorporate provisions from the EU’s  ePrivacy Directive,  and it was amended in 2018 to be consistent with the GDPR and the EU’s  Directive 2016/680 on processing of personal data.  The Loi Informatique et Libertés states that  information technology “should not infringe upon human identity, human rights, privacy, or  public or individual freedoms.” 9  Personal data must be processed lawfully and fairly, and data  that falls under the GDPR should also be processed in a manner that is transparent for the data  subject.  Data may not be used in a manner that is incompatible with the explicit and legitimate  purposes for which it was collected.   "}

Under the GDPR, Iceland permits the\ncollection, storage, and sharing of personal data (including location data) in a limited\nnumber of cases, such as when there is public interest or following consent.\n\nAs of May 22, 2020, Iceland only had two active cases of COIVD-19 infection, with 1,791\npatients recovered and ten fatalities, making it one of the countries globally that has\nmost successfully managed to stem the spread of the disease. Iceland has launched a\nCOVID-19 transmission app to contact trace infections. The app tracks and saves the\nlocation of users on their smartphones. If a user is later confirmed infected with COVID-\n19, the Icelandic Contact Tracing Team requests access to the location data from the\nphone. While the app has been downloaded by 40% of the population, it has mainly\nserved to complement ordinary contact tracing methods.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA.

As a European  Economic Area member, Iceland is bound by some EU legislation, and has  implemented both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on  Privacy and Electronic Communications. Under the GDPR, Iceland permits the  collection, storage, and sharing of personal data (including location data) in a limited  number of cases, such as when there is public interest or following consent.   \nAs of May 22, 2020, Iceland only had two active cases of COIVD-19 infection, with 1,791  patients recovered and ten fatalities, making it one of the countries globally that has  most successfully managed to stem the spread of the disease. Iceland has launched a  COVID-19 transmission app to contact trace infections. The app tracks and saves the  location of users on their smartphones. If a user is later confirmed infected with COVID- 19, the Icelandic Contact Tracing Team requests access to the location data from the  phone. While the app has been downloaded by   $40\\%$   of the population, it has mainly  served to complement ordinary contact tracing methods.    \nI. Introduction \nA. COVID-19 in Numbers \nIceland is one of the world’s smallest independent nations. It is an island in the North Atlantic  sea with approximately 350,000 inhabitants.    \nIceland is considered one of the countries that have, so far, successfully limited the spread of  COVID-19 within its populace.  Iceland reported its first COIVD-19 case on February 28, 2020. Iceland has, as of May 22, 2020, reported 1,803 confirmed cases and 10 fatalities from COVID-19. Of the total confirmed cases, 1,791 patients have recovered.  Currently, there are only two active  cases, and the country has not recorded any new cases since May 12, 2020.  There are currently  no patients with COVID-19 treated in hospitals or intensive care units.  Also as of May 22, 2020,  58,295 persons have been tested for COVID-19 in Iceland.  Only the Faroe Islands (part of  Denmark) and Gibraltar (part of the United Kingdom) have tested more residents per capita.   "}

As implemented in Norwegian law, consent can also be given for the collection and  processing of all sensitive data, as Norway has not provided additional provisions to further limit  the sharing of sensitive information.  Thus, there is no data that cannot be shared provided that  prior adequate and voluntary consent has been given during the collection phase.    \nLegally, information may be stored without the consent of the data subject, if needed for a public  purpose.  However, in such cases the public interest in processing the data must clearly exceed  the disadvantages to the person whom the data is about (the data subject) and must be approved  by the Norwegian Data Protection Agency.  The storage and sharing of data typically requires  anonymization and pseudonym iz ation.  In accordance with the Personal Information Act the  Personal Data Authority may allow the handling of personal data in individual cases, if in the  public interest.  Similarly, the government may issue specific regulations pertaining to data  retention.   The collection of personal data, allowing use also without consent, is regulated in a  number of legal acts, including the Criminal Procedures Act and the Health Registry Act.  The  lawfulness of measures that may be used to contain contagious diseases is regulated in the  Control of Communicable Diseases Act.  The law allows for the collection and sharing of  personal data in order to prevent disease.  The permissibility of using personal data to trace  contagious disease is specifically mentioned in the GDPR, and was also mentioned in the bill  implementing the GDPR into Norwegian law.  The GDPR allows for the use and sharing of  personal information when needed for disease tracing.    "}

According to the National Authority of Communications (Autoridade Nacional de  Comunicações, ANACOM), in 2019 Portugal had 12.4 million active cell phones in the country. However, Portugal has not yet developed a contact tracing app for the pandemic.    \nII.    Legal Framework   \nA.   Privacy and Data Protection   \nOn April 26, 2016, the European Union issued the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on  the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data.   To implement the GDPR into its domestic legislation,  Portugal enacted  Law No. 58 of August 8, 2019, which regulates the processing of personal data carried out in the  national territory, regardless of the public or private nature of the controller or the subcontractor,  even if it is carried out in compliance with legal obligations or in pursuit of missions of public  interest, applying all the exclusions provided for in article 2 of the GDPR.  Under the GDPR the  processing of personal data must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and  transparency; limitation of purpose; data minimization; accuracy; storage limitation; and  integrity and confidentiality.

This information is not included in article 10 of the Personal  Data Law, which defines what information can be recognized as personal. A 2014 government  regulation ordered provincial and municipal emergency services to develop tools that would  allow the identification of the location of a person who calls for assistance in an emergency such  as a fire or roadway traffic accident.  In 2019, Russian legislators decided that geolocation  information is information about services provided to customers by telecom operators. The new  law protects the right of law enforcement to receive this information from mobile  communications providers when a search for a missing child is conducted. Law enforcement  authorities are required to receive judicial approval within 48 hours for the usage of geolocation  information.  Later, the legislature discussed a proposal to expand the right of police to use  geolocation information in all search and rescue operations and allow the mobile phone users to  transfer this information to third persons, however, this bill did not advance beyond the first  reading.  In 2016, a court found that when a telecom company shares with third persons  information about its customers, including their geolocation information, it commits a violation  of the licensing agreement.      \nIII.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  \nThe Russian health care system is based on a strong governmental role in ensuring the country’s  sanitary and epidemiologic well-being. Combating epidemics and responding to emergencies are  included in the joint jurisdiction of federal and provincial authorities.  Government policy in the  area of protection against medical emergencies is formulated in a number of federal and  provincial legislative acts, presidential decrees, government regulations, and government  programs. There is no special legislation aimed at the regulation of issues related to public health  emergencies and epidemics. The outbreak of epidemics is considered an emergency situation,  and depending on the outbreak’s severity, rules under a state of emergency may be declared.   \nWhile the federal legislation was amended with provisions introducing criminal responsibility  for violation of quarantine rules and stricter punishments for distribution of fake news about the  pandemic, most of the measures for countering the pandemic were introduced by regional  authorities. On March 23, 2020, the Prime Minister of Russia ordered the federal Ministry of  Communications to develop, within the next three days, a guidance for regional authorities on  how to build contact tracing systems based on transferring customers’ geolocation information  by mobile phone operators to regional authorities in charge of fighting COVID-19. Transportation  employees became subject to additional control and extended contact tracing.   "}

The Ministry of Health appears to process the personal data\ncollected though these applications under a public health related exception regime that exists\nunder the Turkish personal data protection framework.\n\nTurkey has wide smartphone possession and a high rate of mobile internet use. According to data\nreleased by the Turkish Statistical Institute, 98.7% of households in Turkey had a mobile phone\n(including smartphones) in 2019, with 88.3% of households having internet access and 75.3% of\nthe population using the internet.?

The application shows the user the nearest  essential facilities such as hospitals, pharmacies, markets, and public transportation on a map.   \nThe application incorporates a module for creating a 10 or 12 digit code that includes information  regarding the user’s infection risk status. On May 30, 2020, the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued  a circular ordering the use of the code, called a “HES code,” for purchases of all intercity and  international travel tickets on public modes of transportation, including air travel.  Travelers will  not be allowed by operators on public transportation vehicles if their HES codes indicate that they  were diagnosed as positive, or they have been in contact with a person diagnosed as such.   Moreover, the system will warn passengers who have been in a public transportation vehicle in  the last 14 days with a person who was not indicated to be at risk by their HES code at the time  of travel but has later been determined to be at risk.  Persons who are issued Turkish ID numbers  can obtain HES codes via the Life Fits Home mobile application, through Turkey’s   general e- government portal    $e$  -Devlet , or via SMS (short message service).  Persons who do not have  Turkish ID numbers will not be required to have HES codes to travel until June 5; beginning on  June 6, these persons will be able to obtain codes via SMS by using their personal information  and passport numbers.  HES codes do not appear to include identifiable personal data.     "}

It defines “personal information” as “information relating  to an identifiable, living, natural person, and where applicable, an identifiable, existing juristic  person, including but not limited to . . . any identifying number, symbol, e-mail address, physical  address, telephone number, location information, online identifier or other particular assignment  to the person.” 15  The term “processing” includes “the collection, receipt, recording, organisation,  collation, storage, updating or modification, retrieval, alteration, consultation or use” of  personal information.    \nPOPIA puts in place general conditions under which the lawful processing of personal  information may take place, including accountability, processing limitation, purpose  specification, further processing limitation, information quality, openness, security safeguards,  and data subject participation, as further defined by statute.  As noted above, the term “personal  information” includes location information. The “purpose specification” clause of POPIA  requires that the collection of personal information be limited to “a specific, explicitly defined  and lawful purpose related to a function or activity of the responsible party.” 18  It also requires  that further processing of personal information be compatible with the purpose of collection.   Significantly, it provides that further processing of personal information is considered compatible  with the purpose of collection if “it is necessary to prevent or mitigate a serious and imminent  threat to– (i) public health or public safety; or (ii) the life or health of the data subject or  another individual.” 20   \nPOPIA bars the processing of special information 21  except in certain limited instances, including  when the data subject consents or it is “necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a  right or obligation in law.” 22  In this situation, additional conditions relating to the specific  information in question apply.

Public Health Act  \nThe Public Health Act permits health workers and health care providers who have access to the  health records of a user to disclose the user’s personal information, as defined under POPIA, “to  any other person, health care provider or health establishment as is necessary for any legitimate  purpose within the ordinary course and scope of his or her duties where such access or disclosure  is in the interests of the user.” 59  The Act also requires that a healthcare facility in possession of  healthcare records “set up control measures to prevent unauthorised access to those records and  to the storage facility in which, or system by which, records are kept.” 60   \nIII.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  \nOn March 15, 2020, South Africa declared a national state of disaster under the 2002 Disaster  Management Act due to the coronavirus pandemic.  During a state of disaster, the Disaster  Management Act allows the government to issue regulations relating to,  inter alia , “the movement  of persons and goods to, from or within the disaster-stricken or threatened area,” “the  dissemination of information required for dealing with the disaster,” and “other steps that may  be necessary to prevent an escalation of the disaster, or to alleviate, contain and minimise the  effects of the disaster.” 62  Similarly, the 2004 Disaster Management Regulations (as amended) state  that any minister “may issue and vary directions, as required, within his or her mandate, to  address, prevent and combat the spread of COVID-19, from time to time, as may be required,”  including “steps that may be necessary to prevent an escalation of the national state of disaster,  or to alleviate, contain and minimise the effects of the national state of disaster.” 63  Based on these  authorities, the Department of Communications and Postal Services and the Department of  Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs issued directions and regulations relating to  location tracking for the purpose of combating the spread of COVID-19.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread\n\nOn April 19, 2020, the Health Department in Abu Dhabi announced that it had launched a mobile\napplication, called “TraceCovid.” The department has urged all UAE citizens and expatriates to\ninstall the application on their mobile devices. The main purpose of the mobile application is to\nidentify any individuals who came close to someone who is a COVID-19 patient.\n\nAccording to the main web page of “TraceCovid UAE,” the application authorizes users to detect\nmobile devices that have the same application installed.

The STI consists of anonymized data and a timestamp. In the event that\none of those two people gets the virus, the health department will request that the infected person\nupload the list of STIs stored locally on that person’s mobile phone.
