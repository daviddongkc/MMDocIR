The efficiency of our solar energy products is aided by our own solar inverter, which also incorporates our power electronics technologies. We designed both products to integrate with Powerwall. \nDesign and Engineering \nAutomotive \nWe have established significant in-house capabilities in the design and test engineering of electric vehicles and their components and systems. Our team has core competencies in computer aided design as well as durability, strength and crash test simulations, which reduces the product development time of new models. Additionally, our team has expertise in selecting and working with a range of materials for our vehicles to balance performance, cost and durability in ways that are best suited for our vehicles’ target demographics and utility. We have also used our capabilities to achieve complex engineering feats in stamping, casting and thermal systems, and are currently developing designs that integrate batteries directly with vehicle body structures without separate battery packs to optimize manu fact ur ability, weight, range and cost characteristics. \nWe are also expanding our manufacturing operations globally while exploring ways to localize our vehicle designs and production for particular markets, including country-specific market demands and factory optimizations for local workforces. As we increase our capabilities, particularly in the areas of automation, die-making and line-building, we are also making strides in the simulations modeling these capabilities prior to construction. \nEnergy Generation and Storage \nOur expertise in electrical, mechanical, civil and software engineering allows us to design and manufacture our energy generation and storage products and components. We also employ our design and engineering expertise to customize solutions including our energy storage products, solar energy systems and/or Solar Roof for customers to meet their specific needs. We have developed software that simplifies and expedites the design process and maximizes the energy production of each solar energy system, as well as mounting hardware that facilitates solar panel installation. \nSales and Marketing \nHistorically, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our products, and we believe we will continue to do so. Such media coverage and word of mouth are the current primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. \nAutomotive \nDirect Sales \nOur vehicle sales channels currently include our website and an international network of company-owned stores.

These tax credits are currently scheduled to decline and/or expire in 2023 and beyond. \nRegulations \nVehicle Safety and Testing \nIn the U.S., our vehicles are subject to regulation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), including all applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) and the NHTSA bumper standard. Numerous FMVSS apply to our vehicles, such as crash-worthiness requirements, crash avoidance requirements and electric vehicle requirements. While our current vehicles fully comply and we expect that our vehicles in the future will fully comply with all applicable FMVSS with limited or no exemptions, FMVSS are subject to change from time to time. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that our vehicles meet all applicable FMVSS and the NHTSA bumper standard, or otherwise are exempt, before the vehicles may be imported or sold in the U.S. \nWe are also required to comply with other federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the CAFE standards, Theft Prevention Act requirements, consumer information labeling requirements, Early Warning Reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, owner’s manual requirements and additional requirements for cooperating with safety investigations and defect and recall reporting. The U.S. Automobile Information and Disclosure Act also requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, federal law requires inclusion of fuel economy ratings, as determined by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and 5-star safety ratings as determined by NHTSA, if available.

Government regulations and shifting social behaviors\nhave limited or closed non-essential transportation, government functions, business activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of\nsuch trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce, including in parts of the U.S. and\na number of areas in Europe.\n\nWe temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities worldwide for a part of the first half of 2020. Some of our suppliers and\npartners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory\nNevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation reductions while our U.S. operations were scaled back. Reduced operations or\nclosures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and municipal and utility company inspectors have resulted in challenges in or postponements\nfor our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales and energy product deployments. Global trade conditions and consumer trends may further adversely impact\nus and our industries. For example, pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in\nadditional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of microchip supply, and it\nis yet unknown how we may be impacted. Sustaining our production trajectory will require the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors, a stable\nand motivated production workforce and ongoing government cooperation, including for travel and visa allowances. The contingencies inherent in the\nconstruction of and ramp at new facilities such as Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas may be exacerbated by these challenges.\n\nWe cannot predict the duration or direction of current global trends, the sustained impact of which is largely unknown, is rapidly evolving and has varied\nacross geographic regions. Ultimately, we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions to remain flexible and to optimize and evolve our business as\nappropriate, and we will have to accurately project demand and infrastructure requirements globally and deploy our production, workforce and other resources\naccordingly.

For example, we\nencountered unanticipated supplier issues that led to delays during the ramp of Model X and experienced challenges with a supplier and with ramping full\nautomation for certain of our initial Model 3 manufacturing processes. In addition, we may introduce in the future new or unique manufacturing processes and\ndesign features for our products. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully and timely introduce and scale such processes or features.\n\nIn particular, our future business depends in large part on increasing the production of mass-market vehicles including Model 3 and Model Y, which we\nare planning to achieve through multiple factories worldwide. We have relatively limited experience to date in manufacturing Model 3 and Model Y at high\nvolumes and even less experience building and ramping vehicle production lines across multiple factories in different geographies. In order to be successful, we\nwill need to implement, maintain and ramp efficient and cost-effective manufacturing capabilities, processes and supply chains and achieve the design\ntolerances, high quality and output rates we have planned at our manufacturing facilities in California, Nevada, Texas, China and Germany.

In particular, our products are highly dependent on software,\nwhich is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those\nrelated to the Model S and Model X 17-inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S, the seats and doors in the Model X and\nthe operation of solar panels installed by us. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such\nefforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers.

We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies\nthat we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the\nenergy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our\nbattery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing\nfailure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash.

Maintaining such confidence may be challenging due to our limited\noperating history relative to established competitors; customer unfamiliarity with our products; any delays we may experience in scaling manufacturing,\ndelivery and service operations to meet demand; competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicles or our other products and services; our\nquarterly production and sales performance compared with market expectations; and other factors including those over which we have no control.

Any such disruptions or issues may harm our brand and business. \nWe face risks associated with maintaining and expanding our international operations, including unfavorable and uncertain regulatory, political, economic, tax and labor conditions. \nWe are subject to legal and regulatory requirements, political uncertainty and social, environmental and economic conditions in numerous jurisdictions, over which we have little control and which are inherently unpredictable. Our operations in such jurisdictions, particularly as a company based in the U.S., create risks relating to conforming our products to regulatory and safety requirements and charging and other electric infrastructures; organizing local operating entities; establishing, staffing and managing foreign business locations; attracting local customers; navigating foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements; enforceability of our contractual rights; trade restrictions, customs regulations, tariffs and price or exchange controls; and preferences in foreign nations for domestically manufactured products. Such conditions may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our products and require significant management attention, and may harm our business if we unable to manage them effectively. \nOur business may suffer if our products or features contain defects, fail to perform as expected or take longer than expected to become fully functional. \nIf our products contain design or manufacturing defects that cause them not to perform as expected or that require repair, or certain features of our vehicles such as new Autopilot or FSD features take longer than expected to become enabled, are legally restricted or become subject to onerous regulation, our ability to develop, market and sell our products and services may be harmed, and we may experience delivery delays, product recalls, product liability, breach of warranty and consumer protection claims and significant warranty and other expenses. In particular, our products are highly dependent on software, which is inherently complex and may contain latent defects or errors or be subject to external attacks. Issues experienced by our customers have included those related to the Model S and Model X 17-inch display screen, the panoramic roof and the 12-volt battery in the Model S, the seats and doors in the Model X and the operation of solar panels installed by us. Although we attempt to remedy any issues we observe in our products as effectively and rapidly as possible, such efforts may not be timely, may hamper production or may not completely satisfy our customers. While we have performed extensive internal testing on our products and features, we currently have a limited frame of reference by which to evaluate their long-term quality, reliability, durability and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in our products prior to their sale to or installation for customers. \nWe may be required to defend or insure against product liability claims. \nThe automobile industry generally experiences significant product liability claims, and as such we face the risk of such claims in the event our vehicles do not perform or are claimed to not have performed as expected. As is true for other automakers, our vehicles have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in accidents resulting in death or personal injury, and such accidents where Autopilot or FSD features are engaged are the subject of significant public attention. We have experienced and we expect to continue to face claims arising from or related to misuse or claimed failures of such new technologies that we are pioneering. In addition, the battery packs that we produce make use of lithium-ion cells. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials as well as other lithium-ion cells. While we have designed our battery packs to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells, there can be no assurance that a field or testing failure of our vehicles or other battery packs that we produce will not occur, in particular due to a high-speed crash. Likewise, as our solar energy systems and energy storage products generate and store electricity, they have the potential to fail or cause injury to people or property. Any product liability claim may subject us to lawsuits and substantial monetary damages, product recalls or redesign efforts, and even a meritless claim may require us to defend it, all of which may generate negative publicity and be expensive and time-consuming. In most jurisdictions, we generally self-insure against the risk of product liability claims for vehicle exposure, meaning that any product liability claims will likely have to be paid from company funds and not by insurance. \nWe will need to maintain public credibility and confidence in our long-term business prospects in order to succeed. \nIn order to maintain and grow our business, we must maintain credibility and confidence among customers, suppliers, analysts, investors, ratings agencies and other parties in our long-term financial viability and business prospects.

Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of\nour products and may harm our business and operating results.\n\nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions.\n\nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from, for\nexample, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular supplier, concerns of corrosion in Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts, certain\nsuspension failures in Model S and Model X and issues with Model S and Model X media control units. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes,\ntesting of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative\npublic perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be non-\nexistent. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or\nbe noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards.

We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy\ngeneration and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance, and for components not manufactured by us, we generally pass\nthrough to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the\ncustomer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy\nperformance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we bear the risk of electricity production or other performance\nshortfalls, even if they result from failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease\noperations or fail to honor their warranties.\n\nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed.\nWarranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual\nclaims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our\nhistorical or projected experience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3, Model Y and Solar Roof that we have recently introduced and/or that we\nexpect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future.\n\nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks.\n\nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for\nwhich we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some\ncases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations\nand exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us.

The National Labor Relations Board has not yet adopted the recommendation and we have appealed certain aspects of the recommended decision. Any unfavorable ultimate outcome for Tesla may have a negative impact on the perception of Tesla’s treatment of our employees. Furthermore, we are directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as suppliers and trucking and freight companies. Any work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could delay the manufacture and sale of our products and may harm our business and operating results. \nWe may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recalls or take other similar actions. \nAs a manufacturing company, we must manage the risk of product recalls with respect to our products. Recalls for our vehicles have resulted from, for example, industry-wide issues with airbags from a particular supplier, concerns of corrosion in Model S and Model X power steering assist motor bolts, certain suspension failures in Model S and Model X and issues with Model S and Model X media control units. In addition to recalls initiated by us for various causes, testing of or investigations into our products by government regulators or industry groups may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the defect determination or have data that shows the actual safety risk to be non- existent. In the future, we may voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recalls if any of our products are determined by us or a regulator to contain a safety defect or be noncompliant with applicable laws and regulations, such as U.S. federal motor vehicle safety standards. Such recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by systems or components engineered or manufactured by us or our suppliers, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications and service burdens, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \nOur current and future warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims. \nWe provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles we sell. We also provide certain warranties with respect to the energy generation and storage systems we sell, including on their installation and maintenance, and for components not manufactured by us, we generally pass through to our customers the applicable manufacturers’ warranties. As part of our energy generation and storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or other energy performance requirements specified in the contract. Under these performance guarantees, we bear the risk of electricity production or other performance shortfalls, even if they result from failures in components from third party manufacturers. These risks are exacerbated in the event such manufacturers cease operations or fail to honor their warranties. \nIf our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and operating results may be harmed. Warranty reserves include our management’s best estimates of the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty, which are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. Such estimates are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected experience, especially with respect to products such as Model 3, Model Y and Solar Roof that we have recently introduced and/or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volumes than our past products, may cause material changes to our warranty reserves in the future. \nOur insurance coverage strategy may not be adequate to protect us from all business risks. \nWe may be subject, in the ordinary course of business, to losses resulting from products liability, accidents, acts of God and other claims against us, for which we may have no insurance coverage. As a general matter, we do not maintain as much insurance coverage as many other companies do, and in some cases, we do not maintain any at all. Additionally, the policies that we do have may include significant deductibles or self-insured retentions, policy limitations and exclusions, and we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future losses or claims against us. A loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limits may require us to pay substantial amounts, which may harm our financial condition and operating results. "}

Our goal is to continuously decrease production costs and increase the affordability of our vehicles. We are continuing to develop\nand manufacture our own battery cells, with which we are targeting high-volume output, lower capital and production costs and longer range. As cell supply is\ncritical to our business, coupling this strategy with cells from our suppliers will help us stay ahead of any potential constraints.\n\nHowever, these plans are subject to uncertainties inherent in establishing and ramping manufacturing operations, which may be exacerbated by the\nnumber of concurrent international projects and any future impact from events outside of our control such as the COVID-19 pandemic and any industry-wide\ncomponent constraints. Moreover, we must meet ambitious technological targets with our plans for battery cells as well as for iterative manufacturing and\ndesign improvements for our vehicles with each new factory.\n\nAutomotive—Demand and Sales\n\nOur cost reduction efforts and additional localized procurement and manufacturing are key to our vehicles’ affordability, and for example have allowed\nus to competitively price our vehicles in China. In addition to opening new factories in 2021, we will also continue to generate demand and brand awareness by\nimproving our vehicles’ functionality, including Autopilot, FSD and software features, and introducing anticipated future vehicles.

In any case, as we expand, we will have to continue to increase and\nstaff our delivery, servicing and charging infrastructure, maintain our vehicle reliability and optimize our Supercharger locations to ensure cost-effectiveness\nand customer satisfaction. In particular, we remain focused on increasing the capability and efficiency of our servicing operations.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\n\nThe long-term success of this business is dependent upon increasing margins through greater volumes. We continue to increase the production of our\nenergy storage products to meet high levels of demand. For Powerwall, better availability and growing grid stability concerns drive higher interest, and cross-\nselling with our residential solar energy products will continue to benefit both product lines. We remain committed to increasing our retrofit solar energy\nbusiness by offering a low-cost and simplified online ordering experience. In addition, we are working to improve our installation capabilities for Solar Roof by\non-boarding and training a large number of installers and reducing the installation time dramatically.

We incur non-cash stock-based compensation\nexpense for each tranche only after the related operational milestone initially becomes probable of being met based on a subjective assessment of our future\nfinancial performance, and if this happens following the grant date, we record at such time a cumulative catch-up expense that may be significant based on the\nlength of time elapsed from the grant date.

Upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining associated expense is recognized immediately. Because the\nexpected market capitalization achievements are generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievements, the achievement of the former\nearlier than expected may increase the magnitude of any catch-up expense and/or accelerate the rate at which the remaining expense is recognized. During\n2020, several operational milestones became probable and several tranches vested, including as a result of our market capitalization increasing rapidly,\nresulting in the recognition or acceleration of related expense earlier than anticipated and within a relatively short period of time.

Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not\nhave a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the\nvehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is\nreasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all\ncontractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly under these programs for up to 48 months. Our loan arrangements under\nthese programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and\nautomotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded\nto automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis.\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales\n\nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial,\nand large commercial and utility grade customers, including solar subscription-based arrangements. Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes\nrevenue from agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019, which is recognized as earned, based on the amount of\ncapacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have\nbeen met. Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the\nbilling amount. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the\nsystem. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy\ngeneration data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and\ninstallation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or\nthe authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar\nenergy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and\nrevenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and\ncommissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.\n\nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of\nthe system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over\ntime using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as\na percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy\nstorage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered\nto be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage\nsystems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been\ndelivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar\nenergy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon\ndelivery of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.\n\nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the\ncontract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using\nmarket data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work\nin process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset\nagainst revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy\nstorage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain\na contract are expensed as incurred.\n\n36\n", "vlm_text": "Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program \nWe have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced in volume during the third quarter of 2020.

We recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. \nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment \nEnergy Generation and Storage Sales \nEnergy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large commercial and utility grade customers, including solar subscription-based arrangements. Energy generation and storage sales revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019, which is recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount. Sales of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business. \nFor large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance. \nIn instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. "}

The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership is\nholding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through arrangements\nthat do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to direct the\nactivities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have\na majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of all the VIEs.

However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or other assets.

While we resumed operations at all of\nour factories worldwide, our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation, certain\npayroll related expenses and property taxes. As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while\nthey were scaled back in the first half of 2020. This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation\nreductions. Additionally, we suspended non-critical operating spend and opportunistically renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements. As part of various\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle\ncapacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses.

While we resumed operations at all of our factories worldwide, our temporary suspension at our factories resulted in idle capacity charges as we still incurred fixed costs such as depreciation, certain payroll related expenses and property taxes. As part of our response strategy to the business disruptions and uncertainty around macroeconomic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted cost reduction initiatives across our business globally to be commensurate to the scope of our operations while they were scaled back in the first half of 2020. This included temporary labor cost reduction measures such as employee furloughs and compensation reductions. Additionally, we suspended non-critical operating spend and opportunistic ally renegotiated supplier and vendor arrangements. As part of various governmental responses to the pandemic granted to companies globally, we received certain payroll related benefits which helped to reduce the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Such payroll related benefits related to our direct headcount have been primarily netted against our disclosed idle capacity charges and they marginally reduced our operating expenses. The impact of the idle capacity charges incurred during the first half of 2020 were almost entirely offset by our cost savings initiatives and payroll related benefits. \nThe table presents financial data in millions of dollars for a company over three years: 2018, 2019, and 2020.

Additionally, there was an improvement in our non-warranty maintenance services gross margin due to increased operational efficiencies despite additional costs from ramping service centers to accommodate a larger deployed fleet and an improvement in our used vehicle sales gross margin. \nEnergy Generation and Storage Segment \nCost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets.

For example, our local subsidiary has entered into credit facilities to support construction and production at Gigafactory Shanghai. See Note 12, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As always, we continually evaluate our capital expenditure needs and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business. \nIn January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate  $\\S1.50$   billion in bitcoin under this policy. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them. \nWe have an agreement to spend or incur  $\\S5.0$   billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018, which we expect to meet through our operations.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars as we do not typically hedge foreign currency risk. \nWe have also experienced, and will continue to experience, fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the re- measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the local currency (primarily consisting of our intercompany and cash and cash equivalents balances). For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a net foreign currency loss of  $\\S114$   million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the U.S. dollar, euro and Canadian dollar as our subsidiaries’ monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in various local currencies. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a net foreign currency gain of  $\\S48$   million in other (expense) income, net, with our largest re-measurement exposures from the U.S. dollar, British pound and Canadian dollar. \nWe considered the historical trends in foreign currency exchange rates and determined that it is reasonably possible that adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates of   $10\\%$   for all currencies could be experienced in the near-term. These changes were applied to our total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than our local currencies at the balance sheet date to compute the impact these changes would have had on our net income (loss) before income taxes. These changes would have resulted in a benefit of  $\\S8$   million at December 31, 2020 and an adverse impact of  $\\S362$   million at December 31, 2019 assuming no foreign currency hedging. \nInterest Rate Risk \nWe are exposed to interest rate risk on our borrowings that bear interest at floating rates. Pursuant to our risk management policies, in certain cases, we utilize derivative instruments to manage some of this risk. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. A hypothetical  $10\\%$   change in interest rates on our floating rate debt would have increased or decreased our interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 by  $\\S4$   million and  $\\S8$   million, respectively.

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance\nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in\nany way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing\nseparate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAutomotive Sales To Customers With a Resale Value Guarantee or Buyback Option\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the sales return reserve related to resale value guarantees or buyback options was $703 million\nas of December 31, 2020, of which $202 million was short-term. The Company offers some customers resale value guarantees or buyback options. Under these\nprograms, the Company receives full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and the customer has the option of selling their vehicle back to\nthe Company during the guarantee period for a pre-determined resale value. In circumstances where management does not believe the customer has a\nsignificant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option provided to them at contract inception, the Company recognizes\nrevenue when control transfers upon delivery to a customer as a sale with a right of return. In circumstances where management believes the customer has a\nsignificant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee or buyback option at contract inception, the Company recognizes the transaction as an\noperating lease. Management’s determination of whether there is a significant economic incentive includes comparing a vehicle’s estimated market value at the\ntime the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value. Sales return reserves are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for\nexpected future market values. On a quarterly basis, management assesses the estimated future market values of vehicles under these programs, taking into\naccount price adjustments on vehicle offerings and changes in market conditions subsequent to the initial sale to determine the need for changes to the\nreserve.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to automotive sales to customers with a resale value guarantee or\nbuyback option is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in determining the sales return reserve when customers do not have a\nsignificant economic incentive to exercise their option; this in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence related to the sales return reserve when customers do not have a significant economic incentive.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to automotive revenue recognition for sales to customers with a\nresale value guarantee or buyback option as well as the related sales return reserve, including controls over management’s estimate of expected future market\nvalues and historical experience. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for determining whether customers have a\nsignificant economic incentive to exercise their put rights under the resale value guarantee and buyback option programs and, if not, the related sales return\nreserve. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the model applied and the reasonableness of significant assumptions related to historical experience\nand the estimated expected future market values used in the comparison to guaranteed resale amounts. Evaluating assumptions related to historical experience\nand estimated expected future market values involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering current and past performance\nand consistency with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Procedures were performed to evaluate the reliability, completeness and relevance of\nmanagement’s data used in the development of the historical experience assumption.\n\nAutomotive Warranty Reserve\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, total accrued warranty, which primarily relates to the automotive segment, was $1,468 million\nas of December 31, 2020. The Company provides a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used Tesla vehicles. As described in Note 2, a warranty reserve is\n\naccrued for these products sold, which includes management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty, including recalls\nwhen identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims.\n\n52\n", "vlm_text": "Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles\nto us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing\ntransactions as operating leases.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $752 million,\n$532 million and $393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred $293 million and\n$218 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual\nleases.\n\nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.\n\nVehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option\n\nWe offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where\nwe expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to\nrecognize these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing\npartner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing\ncollateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle\nand the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within\ndeferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest\nexpense based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We\ncapitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to\ncost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized\nduring the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash\nflows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no\nmaterial change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating\ncash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or\npaying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle.

Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized  $\\S752$   million,\n\n  $\\S532$   million and  $\\S393$   million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred   $\\S293$   million and\n\n  $\\S218$   million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases. \nOur policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts. Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback Option \n\nWe offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U.S. and where we expected the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to recognize these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nAt the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was  $\\S42$   million and  $\\S214$   million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including   $\\S23$   million within a 12-month period from December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had  $\\S42$   million and  $\\S238$   million, respectively, of such borrowings recorded in accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities and   $\\S11$   million and  $\\S29$   million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized  $\\S77$   million,  $\\S186$  million and   $\\S332$   million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program.

The finance lease classification under ASC 842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840. \nResearch and Development Costs \nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. \nMarketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs \nMarketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising costs were immaterial for       the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. \nIncome Taxes \nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. "}

We write-off customer\nnotes receivable when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant. Using a modified retrospective\napproach for the impact upon adoption, we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses of $37 million on January 1, 2020, with an offset to\naccumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for credit\nlosses, was $334 million and $402 million, respectively, of which $9 million was due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as\nof December 31, 2020.\n\nConcentration of Risk\n\nCredit Risk\n\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable,\nconvertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial\ninstitutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no entity represented 10% or more of our\ntotal accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several\nhighly-rated multinational banks.\n\nSupply Risk\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary\n\ncomponents of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components\nfrom these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n\nAlthough all of our manufacturing facilities are operational, and we continue to increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with\neach of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production, our ability to sustain this trajectory depends, among other\nthings, on the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors through any macroeconomic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nInventory Valuation\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which\napproximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs\nfor excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future\ndemand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.\n\nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This\nrequires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once\ninventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the\nrestoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.\n\nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A\nsmall change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.\n\n70\n", "vlm_text": "Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners.

We write-off customer notes receivable when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts has been insignificant. Using a modified retrospective approach for the impact upon adoption, we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses of  $\\S37$   million on January 1, 2020, with an offset to accumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was  $\\S334$   million and  $\\S402$   million, respectively, of which  $\\S9$   million was due in the next 12 months as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was  $\\S45$   million. In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2020. \nConcentration of Risk \nCredit Risk \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U.S. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no entity represented  $10\\%$   or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks. \nSupply Risk \nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. \nAlthough all of our manufacturing facilities are operational, and we continue to increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with each of our suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production, our ability to sustain this trajectory depends, among other things, on the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors through any macroeconomic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. \nInventory Valuation \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off. \nWe also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. \nShould our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results. "}

The ASU simplifies the\naccounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470- 20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible\ninstruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be\nseparated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in\nthe interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835,\nInterest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring\nthe use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic\n815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting.

The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2021.\n\nWe currently expect the adoption of the ASU will result in the reduction of non-cash interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2021 and until\nthe affected notes have been settled, before the impact of reduction of our interest capitalization, which is not expected to be material. The reduction of\ndepreciation expense through cost of goods sold is not expected to be material for the year ending December 31, 2021. These reduced expenses will increase\nthe income attributable to common stockholders for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The required use of the if converted method is not expected to\nhave a significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalents included in the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our 2021 Notes, 2022\nNotes, 2024 Notes and our subsidiary’s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022.

The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. \nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in ASC 470- 20, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments, the most significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method. The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis. \nWe will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2021 on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption is expected to reduce additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) by approximately  $\\S475$   million and  $\\S50$   million, respectively for the recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt remaining outstanding, which was initially separated and recorded in equity, remove the remaining debt discounts recorded for this previous separation for approximately   $\\S269$   million and reduce property, plant and equipment for previously capitalized interest by approximately  $\\S45$  million, as a result. The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2021. \nWe currently expect the adoption of the ASU will result in the reduction of non-cash interest expense  for the year ending December 31, 2021 and until the affected notes have been settled, before the impact of reduction of our interest capitalization, which is not expected to be material. The reduction of depreciation expense through cost of goods sold is not expected to be material for the year ending December 31, 2021. These reduced expenses will increase the income attributable to common stockholders for both basic and diluted earnings per share. The required use of the if converted method is not expected to have a significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalents included in the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2024 Notes and our subsidiary’s  $5.50\\%$   Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022. The amendments to the derivative accounting guidance are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption will have no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows. "}

The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely\non the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as\nboth Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance\nAward will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for\nthe first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing\naverage, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of\nthe eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation\nand amortization and stock-based compensation.

Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of\ndirectors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The\ncomplaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’\nfees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs\nfiled an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral\nargument on the motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, and the\nDelaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their\nanswer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25,\n2019, and further mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January\n22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would be paid entirely\nunder the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on\nAugust 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statement of\noperations as a reduction to selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the securities litigation related to the\nacquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion and granted in part and denied in part\ndefendants’ previously-filed motion. Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due\nto safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The current tentative dates for the trial are from July 12 to July 23, 2021, subject to change based on any further\nsafety measures implemented by the Court.\n\nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for\nviolations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the\nabove-referenced Chancery Court litigation.\n\nWe believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

We do not currently expect any issues meeting all applicable future obligations under this agreement. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation. \nOperating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China \nWe have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the volumes we are forecasting. \nLegal Proceedings \nSecurities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition \nBetween September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, sevenlawsuits were filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for interlocutory appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for an amount that would be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment of approximately  $\\S43$   million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction to selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred in the securities litigation related to the acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed motion. Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The current tentative dates for the trial are from July 12 to July 23, 2021, subject to change based on any further safety measures implemented by the Court. \nThese plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation. \nWe believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims. "}

If an unfavorable ruling or\ndevelopment were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial\nposition, and brand.\n\nIndemnification and Guaranteed Returns\n\nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from\nreductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged\nfrom a co-sited solar power facility (“ITC”s). Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems\nas assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for purposes of claiming ITCs. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when\napplicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any audits\nundertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not\nprobable or material based on the facts known at the filing date.\n\nThe maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the\nsolar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for\npurposes of claiming ITCs. We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair\nvalues determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through\nto and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine exactly how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs, we are unable to\nreliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date.\n\nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be\nclaimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state’s\nincentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are\nallocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund\ninvestor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received.\n\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $233 million of unused letters of credit outstanding.\n\nNote 17 - Variable Interest Entity Arrangements\n\nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In\nparticular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related\nagreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the\npower and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and\nmake decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be\nsold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the\nfund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.\n\nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these\nVIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of\nincome and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are\nallocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements.\n\nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor's interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the\nformula specified in the agreements.\n\nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements.\n\nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as\noperations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund\ninvestors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had\nbeen pledged as collateral for their obligations.\n\n102\n", "vlm_text": "We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position, and brand. \nIndemnification and Guaranteed Returns \nWe are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U.S. federal laws for the installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are charged from a co-sited solar power facility   $(\"\\mathrm{T}\\mathrm{C}\"\\mathrm{s})$  . Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) for purposes of claiming ITCs. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing date. \nThe maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs. We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the U.S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine exactly how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs, we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of each balance sheet date. \nWe are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in the amount of state or local incentives actually received. \nLetters of Credit \nAs of December 31, 2020, we had   $\\S233$   million of unused letters of credit outstanding. \nNote 17 – Variable Interest Entity Arrangements \nWe have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating. \nAs the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the agreements. \nGenerally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula specified in the agreements. \nUpon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order and priority specified in the agreements. \nPursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or to that of other funds.
