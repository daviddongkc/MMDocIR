Conversely, France’s constitutional\ncouncil ruled against the extension of the protection to managing editors and editorial staff.\n\nIII. Content Recognized as Protected Information\n\nShield rules in most of the surveyed jurisdictions are tailored to protect the confidentiality of the\nnews source, and thus, the protections from disclosure also extend to documents, data, and other\nmaterials that are in the possession of the journalist or other protected persons that might reveal\nthe identity of the source.

Limits on Compelled Disclosure\n\nShield laws in the surveyed jurisdictions typically offer two types of protection to journalists and\nrelated persons: procedural safeguards for searches, seizures, or surveillance ordered by judicial\nand law enforcement authorities that might reveal journalistic information, and the exemption\nfrom testifying in criminal—and in some jurisdictions, also civil—proceedings. In some\njurisdictions, additional protections exist, such those granting journalists the right to protect the\nconfidentiality of sources when the secrecy conflicts with the rights of others. For example, in\nItaly, a special provision in the personal data protection legislation upholds journalists’ right not\nto disclose their news sources when it conflicts with a data subject’s right to know the origin of\npersonal data related to them.\n\nIn the surveyed jurisdictions, procedural safeguards applicable to searches and seizures typically\nappear to consist of a heightened standard that must be employed by courts when issuing\nwarrants related to journalistic material and premises in which journalistic practice is done. For\nexample, in Canada, a federal law requires courts in criminal proceedings to use a reasonableness\nand public interest test before issuing search warrants relating to communications of, or data in\nthe possession of, a journalist. Journalists also have the right to object to the compelled disclosure\nof information or documents that might identify a journalistic source in other types of\nproceedings, upon which the disclosure can be authorized only after a court has applied the test\nand determined that disclosure should proceed.\n\nHowever, some jurisdictions have introduced other types of specific safeguards. In France, a\njudge must carry out searches of premises related to journalistic practice in criminal proceedings,\nand the documents can only be examined by the judge and the journalist (or their representative)\nbefore being seized. Another type of safeguard is found in Portugal, where the journalists’ union\nmust be notified of a search of a media organization’s premises so that a union delegate can be\npresent during the search. In Turkey, it appears that telecommunications between suspects in\ncriminal proceedings and protected persons under that country’s shield law cannot be\nintercepted under a court order if those communications might reveal a news source.\n\nConcerning rules exempting journalists from giving testimony that might reveal their sources,\nthe surveyed jurisdictions have adopted diverse approaches. In many jurisdictions, such as\nDenmark, Finland, Germany, Iceland, Italy, Mexico City, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and\nTurkey, there exist legal provisions that explicitly exempt journalists or authors of journalistic\ncontent from providing testimony in court regarding journalistic information or sources.

Limits on Compelled Disclosure \nThe court has stated that section 10 of the 1981 Act “creates no power or right of disclosure: what  it does is assume the existence of such a power or right and place a strong inhibition on its  exercise.” 8  Thus, individuals cannot be ordered to disclose, or be held in contempt of court for  failing to disclose, his or her sources unless one of four exemptions provided for in section 10 of  the 1981 Act is met,  namely where it is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or  for the prevention of disorder or crime. In all cases, the party seeking the disclosure of information  must have “explored other means of ascertaining the source of the relevant material.” 10    "}

This right derives  from the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of the press and contributes to  guaranteeing an institutionally independent and functional press.   Members of the press  have discretion to make use of this right, and courts have no obligation to point out that  this right exists. However, in criminal trials, if the testimony is required to assist in  investigating a serious criminal offense or other enumerated crimes, witnesses might  be compelled to testify regarding the content of materials that they have produced  themselves or regarding notes/professional observations. This exception does not  apply if it would reveal the identity of the informant or the content of the information  communicated to them.   \nI.  Introduction  \nArticle 5 of the German Basic Law, the country’s constitution, guarantees freedom of expression  and freedom of the press, among other enumerated communication rights.   \nArticle 5 states that   \n(1) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in  speech, writing and pictures. . . . Freedom of the press . . . shall be guaranteed. There shall  be no censorship.

Definition of Protected Journalist  \nThe Press Law of 2004 was enacted to “regulate the [constitutional] right to freedom of the press  and its uses.” 9  Article 12 of the law states, “[t]he owner of the periodical, the responsible director,  and the author may not be compelled to disclose any kind of news source including information  or documents or to testify on this matter.”   \nWhile this article is the main provision protecting journalistic sources and information in the  Turkish legal system, it does not refer to “journalists,” but to “owners of periodicals,”  “responsible managers,” and “authors” as parties shielded from compelled disclosure. “Owners  of periodicals” refer to any natural or legal person who is the proprietor of the periodical.   “Responsible manager” refers to a natural person (typically an editor) who is responsible for  ensuring compliance of the publication with the provisions of the Press Law under pain of  various civil and criminal sanctions provided by the law.    According to article 5, all periodical  publications must register one or more responsible managers. Finally, the law defines “author”  as “the person who wrote or translated the text or news, or created the picture or cartoon, that  constitutes the content of the periodical or non-periodical publication.” 12     "}
