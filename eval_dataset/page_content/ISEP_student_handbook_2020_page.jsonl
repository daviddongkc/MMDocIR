Any request for changes to the modules after the examination results\nrelease such as changing grading basis from S to grade, grade to S/U\nor deleting a module is NOT allowed.\n\nNOTE:\nThe ‘S’ or ‘U’ grade has no effect on the CAP since they carry no grade point.\n‘The modular credits earned with an ‘S’ grade will count towards the total number\nof modular credits that a student needs to fulfil his degree programme. On the\ncontrary, a module with an ‘U’ grade earns no modular credits.\nIn other words, another module which carries the same modular credit needs to\nbe taken to compensate for the “U” graded module, and it should be noted that\nthe limit of three S/U declarations for electives taken by the candidate cannot be\nexceeded.\n\n2. |Lab rotations ‘All new students have to complete two laboratory rotations (LRs) with two ISEP-\n\napproved supervisors within the first 4 months of their candidature.

Examiners must be internationally-recognized  scientists in the field identified by the usual criteria (research output, citations, etc). Supervisors can request to appoint an  external examiner in the event that the supervisor believes that potential reviewers within the university lack the necessary  expertise to evaluate the PhD candidate’s thesis. The external examiner appointed can be in addition to, or in lieu of, one of the  internal examiners, to fulfil the requirement of a minimum of two examiners.    \nExternal examiners who have to examine a thesis with patentable/confidential materials will need to read and agree to the Terms  & Conditions on the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) form before the thesis is sent to him/her. (Candidates and supervisors  are reminded that proprietary/confidential information which is not critical to the thesis for which consent has not been granted  should be excluded from the thesis.)  \nb) Period of Thesis Examination \nExaminers are given seven weeks from the date thesis is sent to them, to complete the examination of the thesis and submit  an evaluation report. Reminders will be sent by ISEP to examiners before the deadline and those who fail to submit their  evaluation reports by the deadline.  \nCandidates are required to attend their oral examination  physically in Singapore  after the theses have been examined.  (Candidates are to bring a copy of the thesis for the oral examination).  \nc) Oral Examination \nAfter all the examiners' reports are received:  \nPh.D. thesis \nIf there are no / minor amendments, the candidate will be notified of the confirmed oral examination date. A copy of  the Faculty's guidelines on the oral presentation will also be given to the candidate.  \nCandidate is strongly advised, with the assistance of the supervisor(s), to identify and respond to major issues and  criticisms raised by all examiners in their reports.  \nThese responses could be drafted in a form of a concise point-to-point written rebuttal that could be communicated to  the examiners before the viva, or on the day itself, through ISEP.
