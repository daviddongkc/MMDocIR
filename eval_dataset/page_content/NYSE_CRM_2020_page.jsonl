Finally, the detection, prevention and remediation of known or potential security vulnerabilities, including those arising from third-party hardware or software, may result in additional financial burdens due to additional direct and indirect costs, such as additional infrastructure capacity spending to mitigate any system degradation and the reallocation of resources from development activities. \nDefects or disruptions in our services could diminish demand for our services and subject us to substantial liability. \nBecause our services are complex and incorporate a variety of hardware, proprietary software and third- party software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our subscribers and harm to our reputation and our business. Cloud services frequently contain undetected errors when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have from time to time found defects in, and experienced disruptions to, our services and new defects or disruptions may occur in the future. Such defects could also create vulnerabilities that could inadvertently permit access to protected customer data. For example, in fiscal 2020, we experienced a significant service disruption due to an internally deployed software update that had an unintended impact on our services for certain customers. As a precaution, we immediately disabled access to our services for potentially impacted customers while we worked to remediate the issue. Upon completion of the evaluation of the cause and impact of the disruption, we determined it did not materially affect our business, reputation or financial results. \nIn addition, our customers may use our services in unanticipated ways that may cause a disruption in services for other customers attempting to access their data. As we acquire companies, we may encounter "}

In addition, to facilitate acquisitions or investments, we may seek additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all, which may affect our ability to complete subsequent acquisitions or investments, and which may affect the risks of owning our common stock. For example, if we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible or other debt securities or loans, our existing stockholders may be diluted, or we could face constraints related to the terms of, and repayment obligation related to, the incurrence of indebtedness that could affect the market price of our common stock. \nIndustry-specific regulation and other requirements and standards are evolving and unfavorable industry-specific laws, regulations, interpretive positions or standards could harm our business. \nOur customers and potential customers conduct business in a variety of industries, including financial services, the public sector, healthcare and telecommunications.

The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, industry-specific laws, regulations and interpretive positions may limit our customers’ use and adoption of our services and reduce overall demand for our services. Compliance with these regulations may also require us to devote greater resources to support certain customers, which may increase costs and lengthen sales cycles. For example, some financial services regulators have imposed guidelines for use of cloud computing services that mandate specific controls or require financial services enterprises to obtain regulatory approval prior to outsourcing certain functions. If we are unable to comply with these guidelines or controls, or if our customers are unable to obtain regulatory approval to use our services where required, our business may be harmed. In addition, an inability to satisfy the standards of certain voluntary third-party certification bodies that our customers may expect, such as an attestation of compliance with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards, may have an adverse impact on our business and results. If in the future we are unable to achieve or maintain industry-specific certifications or other requirements or standards relevant to our customers, it may harm our business and adversely affect our results. \nFurther, in some cases, industry-specific laws, regionally-specific, or product-specific laws, regulations, or interpretive positions may impact our ability, as well as the ability of our customers, partners and data providers, to collect, augment, analyze, use, transfer and share personal and other information that is integral to certain services we provide.

For example, the development of AI and Customer 360, the latter of which provides information regarding our customers’ customers, presents emerging ethical issues and if we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on human rights, privacy, employment, or in other social contexts, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Data practices by us or others that result in controversy could impair the acceptance of artificial intelligence solutions. This in turn could undermine the decisions, predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. \nIn addition, positions we take on social and ethical issues may be unpopular with some customers or potential customers, which may impact our ability to attract or retain such customers. We also may choose not to conduct business with potential customers or discontinue business with existing customers due to these positions. Our brand is also associated with our public commitments to sustainability, equality and ethical use, and any perceived changes in our dedication to these commitments could adversely impact our relationships with our customers.

Although we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver our services to our customers, and could decrease demand for our services. Our corporate headquarters, and a significant portion of our research and development activities, IT systems, and other critical business operations, are located near major seismic faults in the San Francisco Bay Area. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake- related losses, with the exception of the building that we own in San Francisco, and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event. \nClimate change may have a long-term impact on our business. \nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate related risks wherever business is conducted.

Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.

As a result of new standards, changes to existing standards and changes in their interpretation, we may be required to change our accounting policies, to alter our operational policies, to implement new or enhance existing systems so that they reflect new or amended financial reporting standards, and to adjust our published financial statements.

The dollar variance between these two years is a decrease of $115 million.\n\n- For \"Other expense,\" the company reported an expense of $18 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2020, compared to an expense of $94 million for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2019. The dollar variance is a decrease in expense of $76 million.\nGains on strategic investments, net consists primarily of mark-to-market adjustments related to our publicly held equity securities, observable price adjustments related to our privately held equity securities and other adjustments. Net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on privately held equity securities of  $\\S208$   million and unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of\n\n  $\\S138$   million. In addition, net gains recognized during fiscal 2020 included gains of approximately  $\\S9$   million and\n\n  $\\S39$   million as a result of remeasuring our prior equity interest in MapAnything and ClickSoftware, respectively. Net gains recognized during fiscal 2019 were primarily driven by unrealized gains recognized on publicly traded securities of   $\\S345$   million. \nOther expense primarily consists of interest expense on our debt as well as our operating and finance leases offset by investment income. Interest expense was   $\\S131$   million and   $\\S154$   million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Investment income increased  $\\S61$   million in fiscal 2020 compared to the same periods a year ago due to higher interest income across our portfolio, which is primarily a result of the larger cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.

We monitor ratings, credit spreads and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our on-going assessment of counterparty risk, we adjust our exposure to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in place with collateral features. \nWe have an investment portfolio that includes strategic investments in privately held and publicly traded companies, which range from early-stage companies to more mature companies both domestically and internationally. We primarily invest in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators to create and expand our ecosystem. As the enterprise cloud computing ecosystem continues to mature and technologies change, our investment strategy and corresponding investment opportunities have expanded to include investments in companies concurrently with their initial public offerings, as well as larger capital investments in late stage companies. We plan to continue these types of strategic investments, including in companies representing targeted geographies and targeted business and technological initiatives, as opportunities arise that we find attractive. \nAs of January 31, 2020, our portfolio consisted of investments in over 260 companies, with capital investments ranging from less than  $\\S0.3$   million to approximately   $\\S300$   million, and 27 investments with carrying values individually equal to or in excess of approximately  $\\S10$   million. \nThe table provides financial data related to equity securities, broken down into publicly and privately held categories. It includes the following columns:\n\n1. **Investment Type**\n   - Publicly held equity securities\n   - Privately held equity securities\n   - Total equity securities\n\n2. **Capital Invested**\n   - Publicly: $249\n   - Privately: $1,288\n   - Total: $1,537\n\n3. **Unrealized Gains (Cumulative)**\n   - Publicly: $142\n   - Privately: $448\n   - Total: $590\n\n4. **Unrealized Losses (Cumulative)**\n   - Publicly: $(21)\n   - Privately: $(193)\n   - Total: $(214)\n\n5. **Carrying Value as of January 31, 2020**\n   - Publicly: $370\n   - Privately: $1,543\n   - Total: $1,913\n\nThe table summarizes the overall investment performance, showing capital invested, cumulative gains, cumulative losses, and carrying value.\nWe anticipate additional volatility to our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in market prices, observable price changes and impairments to our investments. These changes could be material based on market conditions and events. While historically our investment portfolio has had a positive impact on our financial results, that may not be true for future periods, particularly in periods of significant market fluctuations that affect our equity securities within our strategic investments portfolio.

Over the past few years, the Company has completed a\nnumber of acquisitions. These acquisitions have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and\nreach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market.\n\nWhile the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a\nresult of the Company’s acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company’s business operates in one\noperating segment because most of the Company’s offerings operate on its single Customer 360 Platform and\nmost of the Company’s products are deployed in a nearly identical way, and the Company’s CODMs evaluate the\nCompany’s financial information and resources and assess the performance of these resources on a consolidated\nbasis. Since the Company operates in one operating segment, all required financial segment information can be\nfound in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nConcentrations of Credit Risk, Significant Customers and Investments\n\nThe Company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of\ncash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and accounts receivable. Collateral is not required for accounts\nreceivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable. This allowance is based\nupon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk\nof loss associated with delinquent accounts. Receivables are written-off and charged against the recorded\nallowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. The Company had an allowance\nfor doubtful accounts of $23 million and $22 million at January 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nNo single customer accounted for more than five percent of accounts receivable at January 31, 2020 and\nJanuary 31, 2019. No single customer accounted for five percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2020,\n2019 and 2018. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, assets located outside the Americas were\n12 percent and 14 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2020 and January 31, 2019, assets\nlocated in the United States were 87 percent and 84 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio. As of\nJanuary 31, 2020, the Company held five investments with carrying values that were individually greater than\nfive percent of its total strategic investments, of which one was publicly traded and four were privately held. As\nof January 31, 2019, the Company held five investments that were individually greater than five percent of its\ntotal strategic investments, of which four were publicly traded and one was privately held.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription revenues, which are comprised of\nsubscription fees from customers accessing the Company’s enterprise cloud computing services (collectively,\n“Cloud Services”), software licenses, and from customers paying for additional support beyond the standard\nsupport that is included in the basic subscription fees; and (2) related professional services such as process\nmapping, project management and implementation services.

Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term.\n\nWith the May 2018 acquisition of MuleSoft, Inc. (“MuleSoft’) and the August 2019 acquisition of Tableau\nSoftware, Inc. (“Tableau”), subscription and support revenues also includes revenues associated with software\nlicenses.

Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and current and noncurrent operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, accrued expenses and other liabilities, and other noncurrent liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. \nROU assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the corresponding lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The lease ROU asset is reduced for tenant incentives and excludes any initial direct costs incurred. As the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the net present value of future minimum lease payments is determined using the Company’s incremental borrowing rate. The Company’s incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options are reflected in the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company reassesses the lease term if and when a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within the control of the Company, such as construction of significant leasehold improvements that are expected to have economic value when the option becomes exercisable. \nLease expenses for minimum lease payments for operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Any sublease payments received in excess of the straight-line rent payments for the sublease are recorded as an offset to operating expenses and recognized over the sublease life. \nStock-Based Expense \nStock-based expenses related to stock options are measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and restricted stock awards based on grant date at fair value using the closing stock price. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to stock options and restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting term of four years. \nStock-based expenses related to the Company’s Amended and Restated 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP” or “2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan”) are measured based on grant date at fair value using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company recognizes stock-based expenses related to shares issued pursuant to the 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan on a straight-line basis over the offering period, which is 12 months. The ESPP allows employees to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a 15 percent discount and also allows employees to reduce their percentage election once during a six month purchase period (December 15 and June 15 of each fiscal year), but not increase that election until the next one-year offering period.

Future\nrealization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the\nappropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods\navailable under the applicable tax law. The Company regularly reviews the deferred tax assets for recoverability\nbased on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of\nexisting temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company’s judgments regarding future\nprofitability may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully\nexecute its business plans.

The dilutive effect of outstanding awards and convertible securities is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. \nThis table shows the components used to calculate the basic and diluted earnings per share for a company in the fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\n\nThe table is divided into two main sections: Numerator and Denominator.\n\n1. **Numerator:**\n   - **Net income:** These are the net income amounts for each fiscal year, which are $126 million for 2020, $1,110 million for 2019, and $360 million for 2018.\n\n2. **Denominator:**\n   - **Weighted-average shares outstanding for basic earnings per share:** \n     - 829 million shares for 2020\n     - 751 million shares for 2019\n     - 715 million shares for 2018\n   - **Effect of dilutive securities:** This section shows the effect of various dilutive securities that are included for calculating diluted earnings per share.\n     - **Convertible senior notes which matured in April 2018:** 0 million shares for 2020, 1 million shares for 2019, and 5 million shares for 2018.\n     - **Employee stock awards:** 21 million shares for 2020 and 2019, and 14 million shares for 2018.\n     - **Warrants which settled in June and July 2018:** 0 million shares for 2020, 2 million shares for 2019, and 1 million shares for 2018.\n\n3. **Adjusted weighted-average shares outstanding and assumed conversions for diluted earnings per share:** \n   - 850 million shares for 2020\n   - 775 million shares for 2019\n   - 735 million shares for 2018\n\nThis table provides information essential for calculating the company's earnings per share for both basic and diluted scenarios.\nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2020 reflects the impact of approximately 102 million shares issued in relation to the acquisitions of Tableau and ClickSoftware in the third quarter fiscal 2020. \nThe weighted-average number of shares outstanding used in the computation of diluted earnings per share does not include the effect of the following potential outstanding common stock. The effects of these potentially outstanding shares were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive (in millions): \nThe table shows data for the fiscal years ended on January 31 for 2020, 2019, and 2018. The values are:\n\n- 2020: 7\n- 2019: 4\n- 2018: 7\n\nThe specific context or what these numbers represent is not provided."}

These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, estimated settlements, legal rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. The outcomes of legal proceedings and other contingencies are, however, inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. As a result, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount or range of possible losses in excess of any amounts accrued, including losses that could arise as a result of application of non-monetary remedies, with respect to the contingencies it faces, and the Company’s estimates may not prove to be accurate. \nIn management’s opinion, resolution of all current matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, depending on the nature and timing of any such dispute or other contingency, an unfavorable resolution of a matter could "}
