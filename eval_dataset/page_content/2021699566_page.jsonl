While there are some differing\nrules between the two houses, in general, committees may be standing (usually\nappointed at the start of a parliament and continuing until the end of that parliament)\nor select (cease to exist once a final report is presented). There are also joint committees\nand statutory committees. Debate is ongoing over whether the subject matter of\ncommittee inquiries is limited to the areas of legislative power provided to the\nParliament under the Australian Constitution. The sub judice convention, whereby\nrestrictions are imposed on parliamentary activity with regard to matters awaiting\nadjudication in a court of law, may lead to certain evidence being taken in camera, but\ndoes not restrain the ability of a committee to inquire into a matter.\n\nBoth houses delegate the power to summon witnesses and require the production of\ndocuments to their committees. While there is no formal legal limitation on such power,\nthere may be implicit limitations with respect to members of the other house or other\nparliaments, the head of state, and judges. Public interest immunity may be claimed by\nthe executive branch, although in practice this may lead to negotiations and possible\nfindings of contempt, depending on the circumstances. Committees hold public\nhearings and publish their proceedings, and have the authority to determine the\npublication of evidence. Upon the completion of reports, the government formally\nresponds to committee recommendations within a certain time period.\n\nI.

While there are some differing  rules between the two houses, in general, committees may be standing (usually  appointed at the start of a parliament and continuing until the end of that parliament)  or select (cease to exist once a final report is presented). There are also joint committees  and statutory committees. Debate is ongoing over whether the subject matter of  committee inquiries is limited to the areas of legislative power provided to the  Parliament under the Australian Constitution. The sub judice convention, whereby  restrictions are imposed on parliamentary activity with regard to matters awaiting  adjudication in a court of law, may lead to certain evidence being taken in camera, but  does not restrain the ability of a committee to inquire into a matter.   \nBoth houses delegate the power to summon witnesses and require the production of  documents to their committees. While there is no formal legal limitation on such power,  there may be implicit limitations with respect to members of the other house or other  parliaments, the head of state, and judges. Public interest immunity may be claimed by  the executive branch, although in practice this may lead to negotiations and possible  findings of contempt, depending on the circumstances. Committees hold public  hearings and publish their proceedings, and have the authority to determine the  publication of evidence. Upon the completion of reports, the government formally  responds to committee recommendations within a certain time period.   \nI.

[t]he mode in which its powers, privileges, and immunities may be exercised  and upheld.” 2  The standing orders of both the House 3  and the Senate 4  contain rules regarding  the establishment, operation, and powers of parliamentary committees. Other relevant sources  with respect to the rules and procedures of committees include the Parliamentary Privileges Act  1987 (Cth),  the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908 (Cth),  parliamentary resolutions and sessional or  procedural orders, relevant court decisions, and the established practices of the two houses.

Parliament is the “supreme legislative body of India” comprised of the  President and an upper house, the Rajya Sabha (the Council of States), and the lower house, the  Lok Sabha (the House of the People).

Committee System   \nIn India, parliamentary committees in both Houses 3  are mainly of two types: ad hoc committees  and standing committees.   Standing committees “are permanent and regular committees which  are constituted from time to time in pursuance of the provisions of an Act of Parliament or Rules  of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.” 5  The work of these committees is of a  “continuous nature.” 6   "}

The Railway\nConvention Committee, the Committees on the Draft Five-Year Plans, and the Hindi Equivalents\nCommittee are examples of Lok Sabha committees “appointed for specific purposes.” !! Report\nfindings appear to be recommendations and are not binding, but can be influential and help shape\npublic debate and discussion. Committees appear to have “closed door meetings, which allows\nthem to freely question and discuss issues and arrive at a consensus.” !2\n\nAd hoc committees can also be in the form of joint parliamentary committees (JPCs) “on which\nmembers of both the Houses are represented.” !3 JPCs can be\n\nconstituted to investigate serious issues which have greatly agitated the public mind and\nwhich involves [sic] frauds or corruption on a large scale.

Upon request of the Committee, the Houses used their  investigative power in place of the Committee.   23   The meetings were open to the public in  principle.  The Committee could make them closed-door, and in such cases some parts of the  record of proceedings could be kept secret.   \nIII.  Subject Matter of the Inquiry    \nHouses of the Diet may investigate any matters in relation to the government if the Diet’s general  power covers those matters.  For example, affairs within a private organization are not matters  under the Diet’s power, therefore a House cannot use its investigative power over such matters. \nScholars generally think it is acceptable, with some limitations, for a House to investigate a case  that public prosecutors are already investigating.  Regarding the limitations, a district court  decision has stated that, when there is a risk to the independence of the judiciary or fairness of  criminal justice, a parliamentary investigation is limited. The court suggested the following  examples: (a) investigations that seek to exert political pressure on the exercise of the  prosecution’s power to prosecute or  not prosecute; (b) investigations that are directly related to  the contents of prosecutors’ investigations and the prosecution of a case; and (c) investigations  conducted by methods that seriously hinder the continuation of the investigation.
