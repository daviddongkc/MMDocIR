The incredible history told  at the  North Sea Traffic Museum , Fjell  \nThe image shows an exterior view of Cornelius Sjomat Restaurant situated by the water. The restaurant appears to be built on the shoreline, with multiple levels and large windows. The setting suggests a scenic view, likely offering dining with a view of the water. The surrounding area is enhanced by natural elements such as trees and rocks.

{"page": 42, "image_path": "doc_images/Bergen-Brochure-en-2022-23_42.jpg", "ocr_text": "", "vlm_text": "The image shows a street scene with a red tram moving along tracks in an urban area. There are people walking near the tram, and some are crossing the street at a pedestrian crossing. The area is lined with green trees and buildings in the background. Additionally, there are benches and a trash can visible in the foreground. Overlaying the image is text that reads \"Chapter 9: Transport from here to there\" in white letters.\nTo see the best of Bergen, it’s important to get  around. Travel efficiently from A to B to get the  most out of your stay. \nThe pride of Bergen’s public transport,  Bergen Light Rail,  is a light rail service  that operates between Byparken in  Bergen city centre and Bergen Airport  Flesland. Since Bergen Light Rail largely  runs separate from other traffic, and has  right of way at traffic lights, it is a more  efficient form of transport than ordinary  city trams. The many stops in central areas  make Bergen Light Rail a popular means  of transport for locals, tourists and visitors.  There are good bus connections at many of  the stops, such as Byparken and Lagunen,  for those who wish to travel further by  public transport.  \nThe Bergen Card enables you to travel free  of charge on  Skyss’s  bus and Bergen Light  Rail services in Bergen and Hordaland. \nAs well as saving money and transporting  you efficiently to destinations in the region,  it can also provide a golden opportunity  to see the areas around Bergen. With the  Bergen Card in your pocket, you are free  to go where you want, when you want. For  free. You can, for example, take Bergen  Light Rail to Troldhaugen and Fantoft  Stave Church, or a bus to Old Bergen  Museum, Lysøen, Voss, the Hardanger fjord  or the Aur lands fjord. If you plan to walk  to Trolltunga, you can travel free of  charge from Bergen to Odda with the  Bergen Card.  \nBuses are perhaps the most flexible  means of travelling on public transport in  and around Bergen. The well-developed  scheduled bus services bring you close  to your destination in Bergen city centre,  on Osterøy, Bergen North, Bergen South,  Os, Hardanger, Voss and Austevoll. The  main lines cover large areas of the Bergen  Region, and the express buses transport  passengers quickly to the bus terminals  in the different districts. Tickets can be  bought in kiosks or on an online/mobile  phone app. \nIt also entitles you to a discount on the  airport bus, or you can take the Bergen  Light Rail from the city centre to Flesland  free of charge. If you want to make your  own way around, the Bergen Card entitles  you to a discount on  parking  at Bygarasjen  multi-storey car park in the city centre. "}
