For example,  Sweden  allows the operation of drones in the  open category from 15 whereas most other  EU  member states allow this operation from age 16  which is the same as the age requirement in  Japan .

In  Australia , the training includes both  knowledge and practical skills, which are both tested by a certified training provider. Training  with regards to aeronautical knowledge must include at least 15 hours with a training instructor.    In  Israel , tested topics include specifically, among others, “aviation law,” “air traffic provisions,”    “general technical knowledge,” “principles of meteorology,” “practical navigation principles,”  and “safety procedures.” In addition, an applicant must have a minimum of 250 hours of relevant  operational experience.

The EU does not require practical training for subcategory A1 of its open\ncategory, and all other training requirements differ depending on the class identification and the\noperation category of the drone.\n\nB. Testing\n\nSimilar to the training requirements mentioned above, most surveyed jurisdictions require both\na knowledge test and practical skills test for licenses to operate drones commercially. The\noperation of most smaller drones, however, which in the EU are designated as falling in the open\ncategory, requires an online written knowledge test on the subjects of air safety, airspace\nrestrictions, aviation regulation, human performance limitations, operational procedures, drone\ngeneral knowledge, privacy and data protection, insurance, and security.\n\nC. Fees\n\nFees and the fee structure for training and licensing of drone operations vary among the surveyed\njurisdictions. Most jurisdictions require fees for taking the test, as well as for receiving the\ncertification. For example, Brazil leverages separate fees for registration, testing, and the issuance\nof an airworthiness certificate. In Israel, different fees apply depending on drones’ weight for\napplications for certificate of fitness, with additional fees for experimental or special use of\ndrones, as well as for operating drones. Member states of the European Union, such as Sweden,\nalso leverage different fees depending on what category the license falls under, making licenses\nin the open category less expensive than in the specific category. In addition, France allows\nunemployed jobseekers to take the knowledge exam for free.\n\nD. Certification/License\n\nMost jurisdictions surveyed require that a person who completes the training, testing, and pays\nthe relevant fees, also registers in a national registry before being permitted to operate drones.\n\nIII. Renewal Requirements\n\nMost jurisdictions require renewal of licenses for operating drones both recreationally and\ncommercially. For example, Brazil requires annual revalidations which include knowledge and\npractical tests. In Israel, licenses expire after 24 months but can be extended if they meet\nminimum time operational requirements. In Japan, the license must be renewed after three years\nand requires completion of additional theoretical training. In the EU, renewal requirements\ndepend on the category the drone operation falls into, with the open category requiring renewal\nevery five years, whereas the specific category does not expire but the certification, which states\nthat the holder continues to comply with relevant rules, is only valid for two years. For the open\ncategory, a refresher training instead of retesting may be chosen if the renewal takes place within\nthe validity period.

Introduction  \nIn Australia, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and those who operate or pilot them for commercial  purposes are subject to various rules under part 101 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1988  (Cth) (CASR).  A Manual of Standards 2  (MOS) and other legislative instruments also apply, and  the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has produced guidance material on the rules.   \nHolding a remotely piloted aircraft operator’s certificate (ReOC) allows a person or business to  trade as a drone service provider for hire or reward. A holder of an ReOC is permitted to conduct  a range of RPA operations, to employ remote pilots to operate RPA, and is subject to certain  obligations. The ReOC does not allow the holder to operate an RPA – in order to operate an RPA,  a person must hold a remote pilot license (RePL).   \nRPA are categorized under the CASR according to their size and type.  An ReOC is not required  if a person or business is eligible to operate a “micro RPA” (up to 250 grams) or RPA that fall  within an excluded category under the regulations, or if the person or business is flying an RPA  for recreation. ReOC holders can employ remote pilots to operate RPA that weigh less than  7 kilograms (kg), less than   $25\\ \\mathrm{kg},$   less than   $150\\ \\mathrm{kg},$   or more than   $150\\,\\mathrm{\\kg}$   (with additional  certification required for the RPA). The ReOC lists the conditions of operation, including the type  of RPA, weight restrictions, and manufacturer and model (for RPA over  $25\\,\\mathrm{kg}$  ).  ReOC are valid  for 12 months and renewals are valid for up to three years.   "}

Definition  \nAccording to the Center for Investigation and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents of the Air  Force Command in Brazil, “drone” is considered to be a generic term without technical support  or legal definition to characterize any and all unmanned flying objects, be it of any purpose  (professional, recreational, military, commercial, etc.), origin, or characteristic.   \nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle ( Veículo Aéreo Não Tripulado , VANT) is the official terminology  provided by Brazilian air transport regulatory bodies to define these objects.    \nAir Information Circular AIC N 21/10 of September 23, 2010, issued by the Department of  Airspace Control ( Departamento de Controle do Espaço Aéreo , DECEA) for the purpose of presenting  the necessary information for the use of these devices in Brazilian airspace,  defines a VANT as  an aerial vehicle designed to operate without a pilot on board, which has a payload on board and  that is not used for purely recreational purposes.   In this definition, all three-axis controllable  airplanes, helicopters, and airships are included, excluding, therefore, traditional balloons and  model aircrafts ( aeromodelos ).   "}
