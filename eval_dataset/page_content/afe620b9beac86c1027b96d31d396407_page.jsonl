The Division Bench of Guwahati High Court dismissed the appeal of the central excise department on 4 April, 2003 and directed the department to refund the amounts within 30 days of the judgement. However, the Finance Bill, 2003 proposed a retrospective amendment to the Notification, which sought to provide for the denial of refunds in terms of the Notification from the date of its issue, i.e. 8 July, 1999. Consequently, the refunds earlier granted to the Assam Units were also to be refunded back to the Government within 30 days of the passing of the Finance Bill, which became an Act after passage by the Parliament and assent by the President on 14 May, 2003. \nNotwithstanding the directions of the Division Bench of the Guwahati High Court, armed with the provisions contained in the Finance Act 2003, the department initiated action by issue of orders for recovery of the past refunds from the Assam Units and rejected all the pending claims. The Assam Units, therefore, sought the protection of the Guwahati High Court by moving a Writ Petition challenging the provisions of the Finance Act as being bad in law. "}
