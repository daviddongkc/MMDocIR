These and many other factors described\nin this report could adversely affect our operations, performance and financial condition.\n\nIf we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services\nthat meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer.\n\nThe process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is\ncomplex, costly and uncertain. If we fail to anticipate customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends, our market\nshare and results of operations could suffer. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual\nproperty and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for\nour products and services. If we are unable to extend our core technologies into new applications and new platforms and to anticipate\nor respond to technological changes, the market’s acceptance of our products and services could decline and our results would\nsuffer. Additionally, any delay in the development, production, marketing or offering of a new product or service or enhancement\nto an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customers, causing a decline\nin our revenue, earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position. We maintain strategic relationships with third\nparties to market certain of our products and services and support certain product functionality. If we are unsuccessful in establishing\nor maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace, to reach new customers and\ngeographies or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating results could suffer.\n\nWe offer our products ona variety of personal computers, tablet and mobile devices. Recent trends have showna technological\nshift from personal computers to tablet and mobile devices. If we cannot continue to adapt our products to tablet and mobile\ndevices, our business could be harmed. To the extent that consumer purchases of these devices slow down, or to the extent that\nsignificant demand arises for our products or competitive products on other platforms before we offer our products on those\nplatforms, our business could be harmed. Releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our products\nto perform or may require significant costs in order for us to adapt our solutions to such devices or operating systems. These\npotential costs and delays could harm our business.\n\nIntroduction of new products, services and business models by competitors or others could harm our competitive position and\nresults of operations.\n\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards, emerging\nbusiness and distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on\nthe part of customers and frequent new product introductions (including alternatives with limited functionality available at lower\ncosts or free of charge). Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins and could adversely\naffect our renewal and upgrade rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. Our future success will depend on our ability\nto enhance our existing products and services, introduce new products and services on a timely and cost-effective basis, meet\nchanging customer needs, extend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate and respond to emerging standards,\nbusiness models, software delivery methods and other technological developments, such as the evolution and emergence of digital\napplication marketplaces as a direct sales and software delivery environment. These digital application marketplaces often have\nexclusive distribution for certain platforms, which may make it more difficult for us to compete in these markets. If any competing\nproducts, services or operating systems (that do not support our solutions) achieve widespread acceptance, our operating results\ncould suffer. In addition, consolidation has occurred among some of the competitors in the markets in which we compete. Further\nconsolidations in these markets may subject us to increased competitive pressures and may therefore harm our results of operations.\n\nThe introduction of certain technologies may reduce the effectiveness of our products.

For example, with our cloud-based services and subscription-based licensing models,\nsuch as Creative Cloud, we have entered markets that may not be fully accustomed to cloud-based subscription offerings.

Further, any increases in sales under our subscription sales model could\nresult in decreased revenue over the short term if they are offset by a decline in sales from perpetual license customers.\n\nAdditionally, in connection with our sales efforts to enterprise customers and our use of ETLAs, a number of factors could\naffect our revenue, including longer than expected sales and implementation cycles, potential deferral of revenue due to multiple-\nelement revenue arrangements and alternate licensing arrangements.

We cannot provide assurance that our subscriptions will be renewed at the same or higher level of service, for the same number of seats or licenses or for the same duration of time, if at all. Moreover, under certain circumstances, some of our customers have the right to cancel their service agreements prior to the expiration of the terms oftheir agreements. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rates. Our customers’ renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add features and functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, the prices of services offered by our competitors, mergers and acquisitions affecting our customer base, reductions in our customers spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. If our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our services or ifthey renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenue may decline \nOur future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional features and services to our current customers, which depends on a number of factors, including customers? satisfaction with our products and services, the level of innovation reflected in those additional features, the prices of our offerings and general economic conditions. If our efforts to cross-sell and upsell to our customers are unsuccessful, the rate at which our business grows might decline. "}

Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering\nadopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information. Our compliance with privacy laws and regulations\nand our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers’ adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of\nour services in ways consistent with such consumers’ expectations. We also rely on contractual representations made to us by\ncustomers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable\nprivacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies.

We\ndo not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these representations are false or if our\ncustomers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other\nregulatory action.

However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-\nEU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework. As\na result, we have been establishing alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the European Economic Area to\nthe United States. The legitimacy of these alternate means are subject to differing interpretations among various European\njurisdictions. The requirements or rulings of these jurisdictions may reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer\nservices in certain locations, impact our customers’ ability to deploy our solutions in Europe, or subject us to sanctions, including\nfines and a prohibition on data transfers, by EU data protection regulators. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice’s decision\nmay result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which\ncould result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers.

We have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments\nas necessary based on the factors discussed above.

Any perception of our practices, products or services as an invasion of privacy, whether or not consistent with current regulations and industry practices, may subject us to public criticism, class action lawsuits, reputation al harm or claims by regulators, industry groups or other third parties, all of which could disrupt our business and expose us to increased liability. Additionally, both laws regulating privacy, as well as third-party products purporting to address privacy concerns, could affect the functionality of and demand for our products and services, thereby harming our revenue. \nOn behalf of certain customers, we collect and store anonymous and personal information derived from the activities of end users with various channels, including traditional websites, mobile websites and applications, email interactions, direct mail point of sale, text messaging and call centers. Federal, state and foreign governments and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws regarding the collection, use and disclosure of this information. Our compliance with privacy laws and regulations and our reputation among consumers depend in part on our customers? adherence to privacy laws and regulations and their use of our services in ways consistent with such consumers’ expectations. We also rely on contractual representations made to us by customers that their own use of our services and the information they provide to us via our services do not violate any applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations or their own privacy policies. We contractually obligate customers to represent to us that they provide their consumers the opportunity to “opt out\"' of the information collection associated with our services, as applicable. We do not formally audit such customers to confirm compliance with these representations. If these representations are false or if our customers do not otherwise comply with applicable privacy laws, we could face adverse publicity and possible legal or other regulatory action. In addition, some countries are considering enacting laws that would expand the scope of privacy-related obligations required of service providers, such as Adobe, that would require additional compliance expense and increased liability. \nIn the past we have relied on the U.S.-European Union and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks, as agreed to by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union (\"EU\") and Switzerland as a means to legally transfer European personal information from Europe to the United States. However, on October 6, 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.- EU Safe Harbor framework and the Swiss data protection authorities later invalidated the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor framework.As a result, we have been establishing alternate legitimate means of transferring personal data from the European Economic Area to the United States. The legitimacy of these alternate means are subject to differing interpretations among various European jurisdictions. The requirements or rulings of these jurisdictions may reduce demand for our services, restrict our ability to offer services in certain locations, impact our customers′ ability to deploy our solutions in Europe, or subject us to sanctions, including fines and a prohibition on data transfers, by EU data protection regulators. Furthermore, the European Court of Justice's decision may result in different European data protection regulators applying differing standards for the transfer of personal data, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfer for us and our customers. These developments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nWe may incur losses associated with currency fluctuations and may not be able to effectively hedge our exposure. \nBecause our products are distributed and used globally, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We attempt to mitigate a portion of these risks through foreign currency hedging, based on our judgment of the appropriate trade-offs among risk, opportunity and expense. We have established a program to partially hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations for various currencies. We regularly review our hedging program and make adjustments as necessary based on the factors discussed above. Our hedging activities may not offset more than a portion ofthe adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates, which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things: \nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of expected cash flow available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry. \nOur senior unsecured notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain compliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders or note holders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, any outstanding indebtedness maybe declared immediately due andpayable \nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could increase. Downgrades in our credit ratings could also restrict our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and could affect the terms of any such financing. \nChanges in accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, could have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations. \nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions. Additionally, the adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls. \nFor example, the U.S.-based Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") is currently working together with the International Accounting Standards Board (\\*“IASB\") on several projects to further align accounting principles and facilitate more comparable financial reporting between companies who are required to follow GAAP under SEC regulations and those who are required to follow International Financial Reporting Standards outside of the United States. These efforts by the FASB and IASB may result in different accounting principles under GAAP that may result in materially different financial results for us in areas including, but not limited to, principles for recognizing revenue and lease accounting. Additionally, significant changes to GAAP resulting from the FASB's and IASB's efforts may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls.

Although we have successfully defended or\nresolved past litigation and disputes, we may not prevail in any ongoing or future litigation and disputes. Third-party intellectual\nproperty disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable\nterms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products or offering certain of our services, subject us to injunctions restricting our\nsale of products or services, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy\nindemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various license arrangements and service\nagreements.\n\nBetween May 4, 2011 and July 14, 2011, five putative class action lawsuits were filed in Santa Clara Superior Court and\nAlameda Superior Court in California. On September 12, 2011, the cases were consolidated into In Re High-Tech Employee\nAntitrust Litigation (‘HTEAL”) pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Jose\nDivision. In the consolidated complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that Adobe, along with Apple, Google, Intel, Intuit, Lucasfilm and Pixar,\nagreed not to recruit each other’s employees in violation of Federal and state antitrust laws. Plaintiffs claim the alleged agreements\nsuppressed employee compensation and deprived employees of career opportunities. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, monetary\ndamages, treble damages, costs and attorneys fees. All defendants deny the allegations and that they engaged in any wrongdoing\nof any kind. On October 24, 2013, the court certified a class of all persons who worked in the technical, creative, and/or research\nand development fields on a salaried basis in the United States for one or more of the following: (a) Apple from March 2005\nthrough December 2009; (b) Adobe from May 2005 through December 2009; (c) Google from March 2005 through December\n2009; (d) Intel from March 2005 through December 2009; (e) Intuit from June 2007 through December 2009; (f) Lucasfilm from\nJanuary 2005 through December 2009; or (g) Pixar from January 2005 through December 2009, excluding retail employees,\ncorporate officers, members of the boards of directors, and senior executives of all defendants. During the first quarter of fiscal\n2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the litigation.

We expect to incur no additional losses\nassociated with this matter.\n\nIn addition to intellectual property disputes, we are subject to legal proceedings, claims and investigations in the ordinary\ncourse of business, including claims relating to commercial, employment and other matters. Some of these disputes and legal\nproceedings may include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We consider all claims on a\nquarterly basis in accordance with GAAP and based on known facts assess whether potential losses are considered reasonably\npossible, probable and estimable. Based upon this assessment, we then evaluate disclosure requirements and whether to accrue\nfor such claims in our financial statements. This determination is then reviewed and discussed with the Audit Committee of the\nBoard of Directors and our independent registered public accounting firm.\n\nWe make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss\ncan be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations,\nsettlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Unless otherwise\nspecifically disclosed in this note, we have determined that no provision for liability nor disclosure is required related to any claim\nagainst us because: (a) there is not a reasonable possibility that a loss exceeding amounts already recognized (if any) may be\nincurred with respect to such claim; (b) a reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated; or (c) such estimate is\nimmaterial.\n\nAll legal costs associated with litigation are expensed as incurred. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we\nbelieve that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our\nconsolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of\none or more of such proceedings, claims or investigations.\n\nIn connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software\nAlliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims\nalleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws.

Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us. It is possible, nevertheless, that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution of one or more of such proceedings,claims or investigations \nIn connection with our anti-piracy efforts, conducted both internally and through organizations such as the Business Software Alliance, from time to time we undertake litigation against alleged copyright infringers. Such lawsuits may lead to counter-claims alleging improper use of litigation or violation of other laws. We believe we have valid defenses with respect to such counter- claims; however, it is possible that our consolidated financial position, cash flows or results of operations could be negatively affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these counter-claims. \nITEM4.MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.

In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling\nprices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\n\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services,\nconsulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\n\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each\nelement has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price,\nthird-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total\nprice among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\n\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software\nor software-related elements as a group and any non-software elements separately based on the selling price hierarchy. We determine\nthe selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE\nof selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group,\nwe recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition\ncriteria are met for each element.\n\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally\nused for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP\nfor a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market\nconditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into\nconsideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate\ncertain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make\nreliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments\nregarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially\nimpacting our financial position and results of operations.\n\nProduct revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future\nreturns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in\naccordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by\nour distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory\nin our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated\nprovisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The\namount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product\nin the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors\nand unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns,\nthus impacting our financial position and results of operations.\n\nIn the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels\nare exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms,\nproduct updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates\nare inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which\nwould impact the total net revenue we report.\n\nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the\ndate the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-\nusage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with\ncontract terms as these fees are incurred.

We determine the selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criteria are met for each element. \nWe are generally unable to establish V sOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESPis generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP for a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market conditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into consideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate certain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments regarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations. \nProduct revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. In determining our estimate for returns and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributors on which we have recognized revenue, we rely upon historical data, the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel, the rate at which our product sells through to the end user, product plans and other factors. Our estimated provisions for returns can vary from what actually occurs. Product returns may be more or less than what was estimated. The amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated. Our estimate of the rate of sell-through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs. There could be a delay in the release of our products. These factors and unanticipated changes in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimates differ from actual returns, thus impacting our financial position and results of operations. \nIn the future, actual returns and price protection may exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences, market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms product updates or competing products. While we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, if our estimates change, our returns and price protection reserves would change, which would impact the total net revenuewe report. \nWe recognize revenue for hosted services that are based on a committed number of transactions ratably beginning on the date the services are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over- usage fees, and fees billed based on the actual number of transactions from which we capture data, are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred.We record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue orrevenue,depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. \nOur consulting revenue is recognized on a time and materials basis and is measured monthly based on input measures, such as on hours incurred to date compared to total estimated hours to complete, with consideration given to output measures, such as contract milestones,when applicable\nBusiness Combinations \nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assumed equity awards, as well as to in-process research and development based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, deferred revenue obligations and equity assumed.

Revenue in the Americas and EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. The overall increase in EMEA revenue was slightly offset by declines due to strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro, British Pound and other EMEA currencies in fiscal 2015. Within the Americas and EMEA, fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. \nRevenue in APAC remained stable during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due to an increase in Digital Marketing revenue offset by a decrease in Digital Media revenue.The increase in Digital Marketing revenue in APAC was attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above. The decline in Digital Media revenue was primarily due to expected decreases in perpetual license revenue, partially offset by increases in subscription revenue during fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. \nFiscal 2014 Revenue by Geography Compared to Fiscal 2013 Revenue by Geography \nOverall revenue increased in the Americas and EMEA during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. Revenue in the Americas increased due to growth in Digital Media and Digital Marketing revenue. Revenue in EMEA increased primarily due to growth in Digital Marketing revenue. Digital Media and Print and Publishing revenue in EMEA remained relatively stable Despite strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the British Pound during the latter part of fiscal 2014, the overall weakening of the U.S. Dollar against these currencies during fiscal 2014 also caused revenue in EMEA to increase as compared to fiscal 2013. Within the Americas and EMEA, the fluctuations in revenue by reportable segment were attributable to the factors noted in the segment information above \nRevenue in APAC decreased during fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 primarily as a result of decreases in Digital Media revenue due to slower adoption of Creative Cloud in Japan compared to other countries and the strengthening of the U.S Dollar against the Japanese Yen and other Asian currencies.

Other uses of cash include our stock repurchase\nprogram, which is described below, business acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n\nFor fiscal 2015, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.47 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the\nnet effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred\nrevenue, income taxes payable and trade payables. The increase in deferred revenue is primarily due to increased subscriptions\nfor our team, individual and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services. The increase\nin income taxes payable is primarily due to higher taxable income levels during fiscal 2015. Trade payables increased primarily\ndue to the timing of payments to web services vendors as certain invoices were received in the final weeks of fiscal 2015. The\nprimary working capital uses of cash were increases in trade receivables which were principally due to higher revenue levels.\n\nFor fiscal 2014, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.29 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the\nnet effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred\nrevenue and accrued expenses. The increase in deferred revenue was primarily due to increased subscription and ETLA activity\nfor our individual, team and enterprise Creative Cloud offerings and increases in Digital Marketing and Digital Publishing hosted\nservices, offset in part by decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which we\ndiscontinued in January 2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to accruals for contract terminations and employee\ntransition payments associated with business realignment initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.\n\nFor fiscal 2013, net cash provided by operating activities of $1.15 billion was primarily comprised of net income plus the\nnet effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were net income coupled with increases in deferred\nrevenue and accrued expenses and decreases in trade receivables. Deferred revenue increased primarily due to increased\nsubscription and ETLA activity for our Creative Cloud offering and increases in Digital Marketing hosted services, offset in part\nby decreases in billings for our maintenance and Creative product software upgrade plans which were discontinued in January\n2013. Accrued expenses increased primarily due to amounts due under our fiscal 2013 annual incentive plan and sales commission\naccruals associated with higher achievement levels. Trade receivables declined primarily due to lower perpetual license revenue\nlevels and improved collections compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.\n\nThe primary working capital uses of cash for fiscal 2013 were decreases in taxes payable and increases in prepaid expenses\nand other assets. The decrease in taxes payable was largely attributed to tax payments made combined with audit settlement\nadjustments, offset in part by tax expense and other adjustments during fiscal 2013. Prepaid expenses and other assets increased\nprimarily due to increases in short-term income tax receivables related to the carryback of federal research and development and\nforeign tax credits in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.\n\n51\n", "vlm_text": "LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES \nThe table presents financial data comparing two fiscal years for a certain entity.

The analysis is shown as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014 (dollars in millions): \nThe table shows the fair value of a financial instrument or portfolio on two different dates, 11/27/15 and 11/28/14, under various interest rate scenarios expressed in basis points (BPS). It includes scenarios where interest rates decrease by 150, 100, and 50 BPS, remain unchanged (fair value), and increase by 50, 100, and 150 BPS. Here is a breakdown of the table contents:\n\n- On 11/27/15:\n  - A 150 BPS decrease results in a value of $3,172.3\n  - A 100 BPS decrease results in a value of $3,156.6\n  - A 50 BPS decrease results in a value of $3,135.2\n  - The fair value remains at $3,111.5\n  - A 50 BPS increase results in a value of $3,087.7\n  - A 100 BPS increase results in a value of $3,063.9\n  - A 150 BPS increase results in a value of $3,040.1\n\n- On 11/28/14:\n  - A 150 BPS decrease results in a value of $2,663.3\n  - A 100 BPS decrease results in a value of $2,656.3\n  - A 50 BPS decrease results in a value of $2,641.9\n  - The fair value remains at $2,621.6\n  - A 50 BPS increase results in a value of $2,599.8\n  - A 100 BPS increase results in a value of $2,578.0\n  - A 150 BPS increase results in a value of $2,556.2\n\nThis table is typically used to show the sensitivity of the portfolio or instrument's value in response to changes in interest rates.\nSenior Notes \nAs of November 27, 2015, the amount outstanding under our senior notes was \\$1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of  $\\S900$  million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations. \nAs of November 27, 2015, the total carrying amount of the Notes was  $\\S1.91$  billion and the related fair value based on inactive market prices was  $\\S1.97$  billion. \nOther Market Risk \nPrivately Held Long-Term Investments \nThe privately held companies in which we invest can still be considered in the start-up or development stages which are inherently risky. The technologies or products these companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize, which could result in a loss of a substantial part of our initial investment in these companies. The evaluation of privately held companies is based on information that we request from these companies, which is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as U.S. publicly traded companies, and as such, the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and accuracy of the data received from these companies. We have minimal exposure on our long-term investments in privately held companies as these investments were insignificant as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014. "}

The total amortized cost is $3,116,055, and the total estimated fair value is $3,111,524.\nWe review our debt and marketable equity securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not any security has experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value. We consider factors such as the length of time and extent to which the market value has been less than the cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the investment's amortized cost basis. If we believe that an other-than-temporary decline exists in one of these securities, we write down these investments to fair value. For debt securities, the portion of the write-down related to credit loss would be recorded to interest and other income, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Any portion not related to credit loss would be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders' equity in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In addition, we enter into master netting\narrangements which have the ability to further limit credit-related losses with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement\nof transactions. Our hedging policy also establishes maximum limits for each counterparty to mitigate any concentration of risk.\n\nFair Value Hedging—Hedges of Interest Rate Risks\n\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our\n$900 million of 4.75% fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps\nconvert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we\nwill pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount\nthrough February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 16 for\nfurther details regarding our debt.\n\nThe interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged\nportion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk.

These contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged. \nAs ofNovember 27, 2015, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were  $\\S228.3$  million which included the notional equivalent of  $\\S75.8$  million in Euros,  $\\S44.3$  million in British Pounds,  $\\S37.8$  million in Australian Dollars,  $\\S28.8$  million in Japanese Yen, and  $\\S41.6$  million in other foreign currencies.As ofNovember 28, 2014, total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were  $\\S235.5$  million which included the notional equivalent of  $\\S137.2$  million in Euros,  $\\S30.9$  million in British Pounds and \\$67.4 million in other foreign currencies. At November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less. \nThe fair value of derivative instruments onour Consolidated Balance Sheets as of November 27,2015 and November 28. 2014 were as follows (in thousands): \nThe table presents the fair values of derivatives for the years 2014 and 2015.

Each year's column includes various financial figures represented in dollars. The table layout and the numeric values suggest it might be an income statement or a cash flow statement, but without specific labels or context, it's difficult to determine the exact financial data these numbers represent. The figures possibly correspond to revenues, expenses, net income, or other financial metrics typically found in such statements. Notably, values in parentheses are negative, which is standard in financial reporting to denote expenses or losses. The bottom line for each year (2015: $244,230, 2014: $92,981, 2013: $66,156) is likely the final calculated value relevant to the statement type, possibly net income or cash flow for each year."}

During the first quarter of fiscal 2015 we vacated both ofthese facilities and as ofNovember 27,2015 we consider the Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan to be substantially complete. \nOther Restructuring Plans \nDuring the past several years, we have implemented Other Restructuring Plans consisting of reductions in workforce and the consolidation of facilities to better align our resources around our business strategies. As of November 27, 2015, we considered our Other Restructuring Plans to be substantially complete.We continue to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans, however the current impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements is not material.

BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\n\nIn 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is\naretirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings\nPlan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the Internal Revenue\nService annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2015, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We\ncontributed $25.7 million, $24.8 million and $22.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Adobe is under no obligation\nto continue matching future employee contributions and at the Company’s discretion may change its practices at any time.\n\nDeferred Compensation Plan\n\nOn September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan,\neffective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”). The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified,\ndeferred compensation arrangement under which certain executives and members of the Board of Directors are able to defer a\nportion of their annual compensation. Participants may elect to contribute up to 75% of their base salary and 100% of other specified\ncompensation, including commissions, bonuses, performance-based and time-based restricted stock units, and directors’\nfees. Participants are able to elect the payment of benefits to begin on a specified date at least three years after the end of the plan\nyear in which the election is made in the form of a lump sum or annual installments over five, ten or fifteen years. Upon termination\nof a participant’s employment with Adobe, such participant will receive a distribution in the form of a lump sum payment. All\ndistributions will be made in cash, except for deferred performance-based and time-based restricted stock units which will be\nsettled in stock. As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, the invested amounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan\ntotal $32.1 million and $25.7 million, respectively and were recorded as other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of\nNovember 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, $39.6 million and $31.0 million, respectively, was recorded as long-term liabilities\nto recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.\n\n86\n", "vlm_text": "NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) \nSummary of Restructuring Plans \nThe following table sets forth a summary of restructuring activities related to all of our restructuring plans described above during fiscal 2015 (in thousands): \nThe table provides a financial overview of restructuring plans.

In February 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors retired our remaining share reserves\nunder the 2005 Equity Incentive Assumption Plan (“2005 Assumption Plan”).

Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board\nof Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan. Performance awards granted under this\nplan between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 vest annually over three years, and performance awards granted in fiscal 2015, 2014 and\n2013 cliff-vest after three years.\n\nAs of November 27, 2015, we had reserved 173.2 million shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and\nhad 48.5 million shares available for grant.\n\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n\nOur 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”’) allows eligible employee participants to purchase shares of our common\nstock at a discount through payroll deductions.

Employees purchase shares in each purchase period at 85% of the market value of our\ncommon stock at either the beginning of the offering period or the end of the purchase period, whichever price is lower. The ESPP\nwill continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the shares available for issuance under\nthe plan have been issued.\n\nAs of November 27, 2015, we had reserved 93.0 million shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP and\napproximately 10.8 million shares remain available for future issuance.\n\nStock Option Plans\n\nThe Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors eliminated the use of stock option grants for all employees\nin fiscal 2012. Stock option grants to non-employee directors were minimal in fiscal 2013, and in December 2013 the Board of\nDirectors eliminated the use of option grants for directors as well.\n\nThe 2003 Plan allows us to grant options to all employees, including executive officers, outside consultants and non-\nemployee directors. This plan will continue until the earlier of (i) termination by the Board or (ii) the date on which all of the\nshares available for issuance under the plan have been issued and restrictions on issued shares have lapsed.

Under our 2015 Performance Share Program\n(“2015 Program”), shares may be earned based on the achievement of an objective relative total stockholder return measured over\na three-year performance period.

Our sublease income was immaterial for all periods presented \nWe occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these office buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. We own the land and the East and West Tower buildings, and lease the Alma den Tower building.See Note 6 for discussion of our East and West Towers purchase \nThe lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of  $\\S80.4$  million, which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 27, 2015, the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower approximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the building at any time during the lease term for  $\\S103.6$  million. If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against the purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is  $\\S89.4$  million. \nThe Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor quarterly. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may demand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building If we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building to an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net re marketing proceeds and the lease balance, up to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable. The Almaden Tower lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment and,assuch,the building and the related obligation are not included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nUnconditional Purchase Obligations \nOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course ofbusiness.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial\nstatements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,\nand testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide\na reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because\nof changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial\nposition of Adobe Systems Incorporated and subsidiaries as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, and the results of\ntheir operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended November 27, 2015, in conformity with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
