In March 2020, the Legislative Assembly declared a State of Emergency in\nall the national territory due to the Covid-19 pandemic and passed a law restricting\nsome constitutional rights, among them the right to freedom of movement applicable\nto the areas affected by the pandemic. The law specifically does not restrict the freedom\nof expression and dissemination of thoughts. Both legislative enactments were in force\nfor a month. However, according to news reports, the Government of El Salvador is\namong those governments that, when declaring a state of emergency to combat the\npandemic, have imposed restrictions on the movements of journalists. There have been\nclaims that government attacks against the media have worsened during the pandemic.\nThe Legislative Assembly has created a special commission to investigate digital attacks\nagainst journalists.\n\nI. Legislation Regulating Freedom of Speech\n\nFreedom of speech and of the press are constitutionally protected guarantees in El Salvador.\nSpecifically, the Constitution provides that\n\nEveryone can freely express and disseminate their thoughts as long as they do not subvert\npublic order, or harm the morals, honor, or private life of others. The exercise of this right\nwill not be subject to prior examination, censorship or surety; but those who, by making\nuse of it, violate the Laws, will be liable for the crime they commit.!\n\nThe press is similarly protected. The Constitution states that\n\nIn no case may the printing press, its accessories or any other means for the dissemination\nof thought be sequestered as instruments of crime.\n\nCompanies that engage in written, broadcast or televised communications, and other\npublishing companies may not be subject to confiscation [estatizacion] or nationalization,\neither by expropriation or any other procedure.

Gutiérrez  Senior Foreign Law Specialist   \nSUMMARY   Freedom of speech and of the press are protected by article 38 of El Salvador’s  Constitution. In March 2020, the Legislative Assembly declared a State of Emergency in  all the national territory due to the Covid-19 pandemic and passed a law restricting  some constitutional rights, among them the right to freedom of movement applicable  to the areas affected by the pandemic. The law specifically does not restrict the freedom  of expression and dissemination of thoughts. Both legislative enactments were in force  for a month. However, according to news reports, the Government of El Salvador is  among those governments that, when declaring a state of emergency to combat the  pandemic, have imposed restrictions on the movements of journalists. There have been  claims that government attacks against the media have worsened during the pandemic.  The Legislative Assembly has created a special commission to investigate digital attacks  against journalists.   \nI. Legislation Regulating Freedom of Speech \nFreedom of speech and of the press are constitutionally protected guarantees in El Salvador.  Specifically, the Constitution provides that   \nEveryone can freely express and disseminate their thoughts as long as they do not subvert  public order, or harm the morals, honor, or private life of others. The exercise of this right  will not be subject to prior examination, censorship or surety; but those who, by making  use of it, violate the Laws, will be liable for the crime they commit.    \nThe press is similarly protected. The Constitution states that  \nIn no case may the printing press, its accessories or any other means for the dissemination  of thought be sequestered as instruments of crime.    \nCompanies that engage in written, broadcast or televised communications, and other  publishing companies may not be subject to confiscation [ estatización ] or nationalization,  either by expropriation or any other procedure. This prohibition is applicable to the stocks  or shares [ cuotas sociales ] of their owners.  \nThe aforementioned companies may not establish different rates or make any other type  of discrimination due to the political or religious nature of what is published.  \nThe right to respond is recognized as a protection of the fundamental rights and guarantees  of the person.

A report on Azerbaijan is provided separately.   \nI.  Introduction  \nNew regulations on the media, especially electronic media, in the countries of the former Soviet  Union that were adopted after the COVID-19 pandemic began are characterized by  overregulation and attempts by the governments of these countries to curb free speech on the  grounds of fighting “fake news” during the pandemic, subduing critical voices coming from the  opposition or civil society.  These regulatory activities have introduced amendments to existing  laws on the media and to administrative and criminal codes. In some instances, these activities  were linked to the introduction of a states of emergency and declarations that measures taken  were “temporary.” Several amendments introduced a new vocabulary and definitions of terms,  though in many instances these definitions were considered vague. Among them are such terms  as “fake news,” “online media owner,” and “an authorized state body for media regulations.”   Observers have emphasized that such terms as “social media,” “individual bloggers,” and  “registration requirements” were not clearly defined and their legal status remains uncertain in  many instances. Independent media experts, journalists, media owners, and other civil society  representatives have criticized the regulatory changes and advocated with mixed success  against them.  "}

The spread of inaccurate or false information was addressed  through amendments to the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation; the Code of Administrative  Offenses; and the Federal Law on Information, Information Technologies, and the Protection of  Information. The legislation imposed penalties and prison sentences for spreading “false  information” about the coronavirus.    \nThe Federal Law of April 1, 2020, amended articles 31 and 151 of the Criminal Procedure Code of  the Russian Federation and added a new article 207.1 to the Criminal Code.  According to these  provisions, the public dissemination  of intentionally false information that may pose a threat to  the life and safety of citizens and the nonintentional dissemination of false information without  aggravating circumstances are punishable by a fine of approximately US\\$4,100 to US\\$9,500; a fine  equaling the amount of the wage, salary, or any other income of the convicted person for a period  of one year to 18 months; compulsory labor for a term of up to 360 hours; up to a year of  community service; or restriction of freedom for up to three years.   \nAnother newly added Criminal Code article 207.2 provides for a much harsher punishment,  including heavier fines, correctional labor, or imprisonment for up to three years, when  “dissemination of knowingly false information leads to grave consequences, which, through  negligence, caused harm to an individual’s health.” 40  If the spread of the false information results  in the individual’s death or other grave consequences, the prescribed mandatory penalty is a fine  in the amount of 1.5 million to 2 million rubles (approximately US\\$19,170 to US\\$25,520); a fine  equal to the amount of the wage, salary, or any other income of the convicted person for a period  of 18 months to three years; correctional labor for a term of up to two years; compulsory  (community) labor for a term of up to five years; or imprisonment for the same five-year period.
