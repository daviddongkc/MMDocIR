This specific type of scam is generally referred to as\nthe Nigerian scam because of its prevalence in the country. Such schemes typically involve\npromising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front\npayment, which the fraudster claims to require in order to cover the cost of documentation,\ntransfers, etc. Frequently, the sum is said to be lottery proceeds or personal/family funds being\nmoved out of a country by a victim of an oppressive government, although many types of\nscenarios have been used. This scheme is perpetrated globally through email, fax, or mail.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT): Collective\nterm used to describe the overall legal, procedural, and enforcement regime countries must\nimplement to fight the threats of money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nBearer Share: A bearer share is an equity security that is solely owned by whoever holds the\nphysical stock certificate. The company that issues the bearer shares does not register the owner\nof the stock nor does it track transfers of ownership. The company issues dividends to bearer\nshareholders when a physical coupon is presented.\n\nBlack Market Peso Exchange (BMPE): One of the most pernicious money laundering\nschemes in the Western Hemisphere. It is also one of the largest, processing billions of dollars’\nworth of drug proceeds a year from Colombia alone via TBML, “smurfing,” cash smuggling, and\nother schemes. BMPE-like methodologies are also found outside the Western Hemisphere.\nThere are variations on the schemes involved, but generally drug traffickers repatriate and\nexchange illicit profits obtained in the United States without moving funds across borders. In a\nsimple BMPE scheme, a money launderer collaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or\nVenezuela to provide him, at a discounted rate, U.S. dollars in the United States. These funds,\nusually drug proceeds, are used to purchase merchandise in the United States for export to the\nmerchant. In return, the merchant who import the goods provides the money launderer with\nlocal-denominated funds (pesos) in Colombia or Venezuela. The broker takes a cut and passes\nalong the remainder to the responsible drug cartel.\n\nBulk Cash Smuggling: Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals\naccumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity. Smuggling, in the context of bulk\ncash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one\ncountry to another.\n\nCross-border currency reporting: Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a\ncurrency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of\ncash and other negotiable monetary instruments.\n\nCounter-valuation: Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders. One of\nthe parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring\nvalue to another party and/or offsetting debt owed.\n", "vlm_text": "Definitions \n419 Fraud Scheme:   An advanced fee fraud scheme, known as “419 fraud” in reference to the  fraud section in Nigeria’s criminal code.  This specific type of scam is generally referred to as  the Nigerian scam because of its prevalence in the country.  Such schemes typically involve  promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front  payment, which the fraudster claims to require in order to cover the cost of documentation,  transfers, etc.  Frequently, the sum is said to be lottery proceeds or personal/family funds being  moved out of a country by a victim of an oppressive government, although many types of  scenarios have been used.  This scheme is perpetrated globally through email, fax, or mail.  \nAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):   Collective  term used to describe the overall legal, procedural, and enforcement regime countries must  implement to fight the threats of money laundering and terrorism financing.  \nBearer Share:   A bearer share is an equity security that is solely owned by whoever holds the  physical stock certificate.  The company that issues the bearer shares does not register the owner  of the stock nor does it track transfers of ownership.  The company issues dividends to bearer  shareholders when a physical coupon is presented.    \nBlack Market Peso Exchange (BMPE):   One of the most pernicious money laundering  schemes in the Western Hemisphere.  It is also one of the largest, processing billions of dollars’  worth of drug proceeds a year from Colombia alone via TBML, “smurfing,” cash smuggling, and  other schemes.  BMPE-like methodologies are also found outside the Western Hemisphere.   There are variations on the schemes involved, but generally drug traffickers repatriate and  exchange illicit profits obtained in the United States without moving funds across borders.  In a  simple BMPE scheme, a money launderer collaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or  Venezuela to provide him, at a discounted rate, U.S. dollars in the United States.  These funds,  usually drug proceeds, are used to purchase merchandise in the United States for export to the  merchant.  In return, the merchant who import the goods provides the money launderer with  local-denominated funds (pesos) in Colombia or Venezuela.  The broker takes a cut and passes  along the remainder to the responsible drug cartel.    \nBulk Cash Smuggling:   Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals  accumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity.  Smuggling, in the context of bulk  cash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one  country to another.    \nCross-border currency reporting:   Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a  currency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of  cash and other negotiable monetary instruments.  \nCounter-valuation:   Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders.  One of  the parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring  value to another party and/or offsetting debt owed.  "}

Benin's geographical location makes it a transit country for regional and  international maritime and land trade, thus exposing it to various forms of proceeds-generating  offenses, including cybercrime, corruption, smuggling, and drug trafficking.   \nBenin is vulnerable to drug-related money laundering.  Cases linked to Benin include the  proceeds of narcotics trafficking comingled with revenue from the sale of imported used cars for  customers in neighboring countries.  In the past, Benin was implicated in large international  "}

In 2016, the Burmese  attorney general (AG) identified the AG deputy director general as the primary contact for  mutual legal assistance requests, although this channel remains untested between the United  States and Burma.  \nBurma is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is  available at:  https://www.fatf- gafi.org/documents/documents/mutual evaluation of Myanmar.html.   \nAML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES \nInternational AML experts note several deficiencies in Myanmar's AML/CFT enforcement:   limited understanding of AML/CFT obligations among financial institutions and DNFBPs,  including casinos; poor reporting in STRs; and weak CBM oversight of DNFBPs and illegal  money transfer or hundi services.  The regulations issued in 2019 are intended to remedy  some of the identified deficiencies.    \nThe banking system suffered from an absence of effective prudential regulation by the CBM  during the former military regime.  A government split between civilian and  military-controlled ministries impedes effective government-wide coordination on AML.    \nMoney laundering investigations are not prioritized, do not occur in parallel with  investigation of predicate offenses, and are not in keeping with the risk profile of the  country.    \nBurma has an FIU, which is part of the Ministry of Home Affairs.  However, the FIU is not  a member of the Egmont Group. "}

Furthermore, Costa  Rica does not have an adequate legal framework for non-conviction-based asset forfeiture nor  provisions for asset sharing.  While challenges remain, political will within the executive and  legislative branches to correct this vacuum has intensified, and the prosecutor’s office  increasingly leverages the existing organized crime law to seize illicit assets.

Until then, Melco has been authorized to\nopen five “pop up” casinos throughout the country. ROC authorities are just beginning to\ndevelop the capacity to supervise casino-based activity.

Prior to 2018, eligibility requirements\nwere not stringent and due diligence checks were lax.

In 2018, the government awarded a multi-year,  exclusive casino license to Hong Kong-based Melco International.  Melco is building a multi- million euro casino resort expected to open in 2021.  Until then, Melco has been authorized to  open five “pop up” casinos throughout the country.  ROC authorities are just beginning to  develop the capacity to supervise casino-based activity.  The ROC established a gaming  authority and is working with international gaming consultants to conduct due diligence on  clients, to train staff, and to establish mechanisms to report illicit activity.  Another emerging  concern is the rise of virtual banking and use of virtual currency.   \nThe ROC citizenship-by-investment (CBI) program allows foreign investors to apply for ROC  (and thus EU) citizenship after investing more than  $\\S2.2$   million in ROC business, infrastructure,  or development, subject to several conditions.  This program generated significant investment in  the ROC, some  $\\S7.3$   billion from 2013 to the end of 2018.  Prior to 2018, eligibility requirements  were not stringent and due diligence checks were lax.  Following pressure from the EU and  United States, the ROC tightened eligibility criteria and oversight in 2018 and 2019.  These  changes include:  introducing a cap in the number of citizenships granted annually at 700 and  establishing an interagency committee to better supervise the program; establishing an online  register of and regulating service practitioners authorized to provide residency/citizenship  consulting services; introducing stricter eligibility criteria in May 2019, including a valid  Schengen visa, no criminal record or sanctions, and no prior rejection for citizenship in any other  EU member state; raising the minimum period for maintaining the investment in Cyprus after  naturalization from three years to five; and barring various categories of individuals, including  PEPs.  The ROC also enhanced due diligence by hiring three international firms to conduct  additional background checks on all new applicants.  The changes are a significant improvement  but are still overly dependent on selected, public sources of information for due diligence.  In  November 2019, the ROC decided to review all pre-2018 CBI beneficiaries for potentially  "}

Financial institutions in the DR engage in currency  transactions involving international narcotics trafficking proceeds that include significant  amounts of U.S. currency or currency derived from illegal drug sales in the United States.  \nIn July 2019, the DR FIU was readmitted to the Egmont Group as a result of a multi-year effort  to bring AML procedures and practices into line with Egmont standards.   \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nThe major sources of laundered proceeds stem from illicit trafficking activities, tax evasion,  public corruption, and fraudulent financial activities, particularly transactions with forged credit  cards.  U.S. law enforcement has identified networks smuggling weapons into the DR from the  United States.  Car dealerships, the precious metals sector, casinos, tourism agencies, and real  estate and construction companies contribute to money laundering activities in the DR.  Bulk  cash smuggling by couriers and the use of wire transfer remittances are the primary methods for  moving illicit funds from the United States into the DR.  Once in the DR, currency exchange  houses, money remittance companies, real estate and construction companies, and casinos  facilitate the laundering of these illicit funds.  \nAs of the end of 2018, 673 companies, primarily engaged in manufacturing, are located in the  DR’s 74 FTZs.  These companies are exempt from most national and municipal taxes, as long as  the products they produce are exported to foreign markets.  The National Council of Export Free  Trade Zones regulates compliance with Law 8-90, on Free Trade Zones, and is composed of  representatives from the public and private sectors.  There are no known instances of money  laundering activity in the FTZs.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nLaw 155-17 was updated in 2017 to strengthen penalties and broaden the scope of crimes  covered under the legislation, among other changes.

Legislation to institute non-conviction-based asset forfeiture and align the asset forfeiture regime  with international standards has been under review by the congress of the DR for over two years.

Georgia’s ease of doing business attracts investment, but also facilitates entry\nof ill-gotten funds into the financial system. Much illegal income in Georgia derives from bank\nfraud and cybercrime. Virtual currency is unregulated in Georgia, though the Georgian\ngovernment is beginning to focus on how to address these currencies. Additionally, there is not\nsufficient oversight of the gaming sector. In October 2019, Georgia adopted new legislation and\nan assessment tool aimed at creating effective AML/CFT monitoring and enforcement\nmechanisms. The Russian-occupied territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia fall outside the\ncontrol of Georgian authorities.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nBank fraud and cybercrime are significant generators of illicit proceeds. Social engineering\nschemes are also used to commit mass marketing fraud. Banking systems and money transfer\nservices are the primary means to move funds, and often Georgia is just one link in an\ninternational criminal chain. The general economic situation in Georgia, which is far from being\na developed economy, forms fruitful ground for money launderers to find front men. Georgia’s\nopen business environment makes it attractive for clean investment, but also poses vulnerabilities\nfor illicit funds to enter and transit the financial system. Virtual currency is unregulated, which\nposes a significant money laundering risk.\n\nThe unchecked growth of the gaming industry, including internet gaming, is concerning.\nAccording to the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS) January 2019 Annual Report, there are\n449 lotteries and gaming institutions registered in Georgia and 34 casinos.

The new law extends the requirement to apply EDD measures to\ndomestic PEPs and the heads of international (intergovernmental) organizations; increases the\nability of law enforcement to retrieve information from the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS),\nGeorgia’s FIU, for investigating money laundering and terrorism finance; and includes insurance\nbrokers, law firms, and certified accountants as reporting entities.\n\n103\n", "vlm_text": "Georgia   \nOVERVIEW  \nGeorgia is located along a well-established trafficking corridor and faces international money  laundering threats.  Georgia’s ease of doing business attracts investment, but also facilitates entry  of ill-gotten funds into the financial system.  Much illegal income in Georgia derives from bank  fraud and cybercrime.  Virtual currency is unregulated in Georgia, though the Georgian  government is beginning to focus on how to address these currencies.  Additionally, there is not  sufficient oversight of the gaming sector.  In October 2019, Georgia adopted new legislation and  an assessment tool aimed at creating effective AML/CFT monitoring and enforcement  mechanisms.  The Russian-occupied territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia fall outside the  control of Georgian authorities.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nBank fraud and cybercrime are significant generators of illicit proceeds.  Social engineering  schemes are also used to commit mass marketing fraud.  Banking systems and money transfer  services are the primary means to move funds, and often Georgia is just one link in an  international criminal chain.  The general economic situation in Georgia, which is far from being  a developed economy, forms fruitful ground for money launderers to find front men.  Georgia’s  open business environment makes it attractive for clean investment, but also poses vulnerabilities  for illicit funds to enter and transit the financial system.  Virtual currency is unregulated, which  poses a significant money laundering risk.  \nThe unchecked growth of the gaming industry, including internet gaming, is concerning.   According to the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS) January 2019 Annual Report, there are  449 lotteries and gaming institutions registered in Georgia and 34 casinos.  The AML obligations  of gaming establishments are identical or substantively similar to the requirements placed on  other covered entities.  The Ministry of Finance supervises lottery organizations, gaming  institutions, and casinos for AML compliance.  However, in 2018, casinos and gaming  institutions filed over 1,800 CTRs but only one STR, indicating the industry may not be  complying with existing regulations or is not subject to adequate enforcement by authorities.     \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nOn October 30, 2019, Georgia adopted new legislation, the Law on Facilitating the Prevention of  Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing, aimed at creating effective monitoring and  enforcement mechanisms.  Prior to the new legislation, enhanced due diligence (EDD) measures  applied only to foreign PEPs.  The new law extends the requirement to apply EDD measures to  domestic PEPs and the heads of international (intergovernmental) organizations; increases the  ability of law enforcement to retrieve information from the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS),  Georgia’s FIU, for investigating money laundering and terrorism finance; and includes insurance  brokers, law firms, and certified accountants as reporting entities.

A Guatemalan Court\nconvicted 13 people, for up to 38 years in prison, including former congressman Jaime Martinez\nLoyza and Edgar “Chico Dollar” Morales Guerra, the leader of a money laundering operation\nthat financed political campaigns.\n\nIn another investigation, a Guatemalan anticorruption court convicted 18 people for corruption in\nthe Municipality of Antigua, including the former mayor of Antigua, Adolfo Vivar. Vivar was\nfound guilty of money laundering and fined more than $1.7 million.\n\nAs part of the internal purging of the MP, in a case coordinated with the PNC, two MP officials\nwere arrested by the AML prosecutorial office and the criminal analysis department on October\n13, 2019. The accused accepted an envelope with over $10,000, allegedly in exchange for not\nprocessing an arrest warrant in a money laundering investigation.\n\nGuyana\nOVERVIEW\n\nGuyana is a transit country for South American cocaine destined for Europe, West Africa, the\nUnited States, Canada, and the Caribbean. Cocaine is concealed in legitimate commodities and\nsmuggled via commercial maritime vessels, air transport, human couriers, or the postal services.\n\nGuyana’s National Risk Assessment 2017 concluded it has a medium-to-high money laundering\nrisk and a medium terrorist financing threat. Unregulated currency exchange houses and dealers\nin precious metals and stones pose a risk to Guyana’s AML/CFT system. Other sectoral\nvulnerabilities include the banking industry and unregulated attorneys-at-law, real estate agents,\nused car dealers, and charities. Guyana has made significant progress on the AML/CFT front,\nbut more investigations and successful prosecutions are needed in the future.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nHistorically, the primary sources of laundered funds are narcotics trafficking and real estate\nfraud. However, other illicit activities, such as human trafficking, gold smuggling, contraband,\nand tax evasion, are also sources.

A Guatemalan Court  convicted 13 people, for up to 38 years in prison, including former congressman Jaime Martínez  Loyza and Edgar “Chico Dollar” Morales Guerra, the leader of a money laundering operation  that financed political campaigns.    \nIn another investigation, a Guatemalan anticorruption court convicted 18 people for corruption in  the Municipality of Antigua, including the former mayor of Antigua, Adolfo Vivar.  Vivar was  found guilty of money laundering and fined more than  $\\S1.7$   million.  \nAs part of the internal purging of the MP, in a case coordinated with the PNC, two MP officials  were arrested by the AML prosecutorial office and the criminal analysis department on October  13, 2019.  The accused accepted an envelope with over  $\\mathbb{S}10{,}000$  , allegedly in exchange for not  processing an arrest warrant in a money laundering investigation.  \nGuyana   \nOVERVIEW  \nGuyana is a transit country for South American cocaine destined for Europe, West Africa, the  United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.  Cocaine is concealed in legitimate commodities and  smuggled via commercial maritime vessels, air transport, human couriers, or the postal services.    \nGuyana’s National Risk Assessment 2017 concluded it has a medium-to-high money laundering  risk and a medium terrorist financing threat.  Unregulated currency exchange houses and dealers  in precious metals and stones pose a risk to Guyana’s AML/CFT system.  Other sectoral  vulnerabilities include the banking industry and unregulated attorneys-at-law, real estate agents,  used car dealers, and charities.  Guyana has made significant progress on the AML/CFT front,  but more investigations and successful prosecutions are needed in the future.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nHistorically, the primary sources of laundered funds are narcotics trafficking and real estate  fraud.  However, other illicit activities, such as human trafficking, gold smuggling, contraband,  and tax evasion, are also sources.  The licensing policies and procedures of Guyana’s  unsophisticated banking and financial institutions increase the risk of drug money laundering.  \nGuyana does not have FTZs, offshore financial centers, cyber currencies, or economic  citizenship programs.

The world’s sixth-largest banking center in terms of  external transactions and the fourth-largest foreign exchange trading center, Hong Kong does not  differentiate between offshore and onshore entities for licensing and supervisory purposes and  has its own U.S. dollar interbank clearing system for settling transactions.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nHong Kong’s low tax rates and simplified tax regime, coupled with its sophisticated banking  system, shell company formation agents, free port status, and the absence of currency and  exchange controls present vulnerabilities for money laundering, including TBML and  underground finance.  Hong Kong shell companies can be exploited to launder money, facilitate  illicit trade, and gain access to the international financial system.  \nGovernment of Hong Kong officials indicate the primary sources of laundered funds are from  local and overseas criminal activity, fraud and financial crimes, illegal gaming, loan sharking,  smuggling, and vice.  Groups involved in money laundering range from local street organizations  to sophisticated international syndicates involved in assorted criminal activities, including drug  trafficking.  Horse races, a local lottery, and soccer betting are the only legal gaming activities,  all under the direction of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, a non-profit that collaborates with law  enforcement to disrupt illegal gaming outlets.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nHong Kong has AML legislation allowing the tracing and confiscation of proceeds derived from  drug-trafficking (Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance) and organized crime  (Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance).  These ordinances improve authorities’ capabilities  "}

Pervasive corruption continues  within Iran’s ruling and religious elite, the IRGC, government ministries, and government- controlled business enterprises.   \nIran remains a major transit route for opiates smuggled from Afghanistan through Pakistan to the  Persian Gulf, Turkey, Russia, and Europe.  Most drugs are smuggled into Iran across its land  borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, although maritime smuggling has increased as traffickers  seek to avoid Iranian border interdiction efforts.  In 2015, Iran’s minister of interior estimated the  combined value of narcotics trafficking and sales in Iran at   $\\S6$   billion annually.   \nIn 2011, the U.S. government identified Iran as a state of primary money laundering concern  pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  On October 25, 2019, the U.S. government  issued a final rule under this authority prohibiting the opening or maintaining of a correspondent  account in the United States for, or on behalf of, an Iranian financial institution.  The rule also  prohibits foreign financial institutions’ correspondent accounts at covered U.S. financial  institutions from processing transactions involving Iranian financial institutions.  Additionally,  the FATF has repeatedly warned of the terrorist financing risk Iran poses and the resulting threat  to the international financial system.  In June 2016, Iran agreed to implement an action plan to  address its AML/CFT strategic deficiencies.  Iran’s action plan expired in January 2018, and as  of October 2019, Iran had not completed the action plan. At the October 2019 FATF plenary, the  FATF called upon FATF members and jurisdictions to apply certain countermeasures to protect  the international financial system from abuse.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   \nIran’s merchant community makes active use of MVTS, including hawaladars and  moneylenders.

The government  lacks information-sharing mechanisms on money laundering with the United States but  expressed willingness to conclude a MOU between the Kyrgyz General Prosecutor’s Office and  U.S. law enforcement.    \nIn 2019, the FIU signed international cooperation agreements with the British Virgin Islands,  Macau, and Indonesia.  The Kyrgyz Republic and the United States, however, do not currently  have a records exchange mechanism in place.  In 2019, the FIU reported it referred 169 money  laundering reports and 118 terrorism financing reports and sent 558 financial investigative  requests to the relevant law enforcement bodies.  The Kyrgyz government does not publish or  provide detailed data on prosecutions and convictions, providing only aggregated data.   Government officials do publicly discuss narcotics statistics.    \nAlthough the Kyrgyz Republic strengthened AML legislation, lack of law enforcement capacity ,  interagency cooperation, and information-sharing among law enforcement bodies creates barriers  to successfully countering money laundering.

The country’s porous land and sea borders, visa-free entry policy for  nationals from over 160 countries, strategic geographic position, and well-developed financial  system increase its vulnerability to domestic and transnational criminal activity, including fraud,  corruption, drug trafficking, wildlife trafficking, smuggling, tax crimes, terrorism, and terrorism  finance.   \nMalaysia has largely up-to-date AML legislation, well-developed policies, institutional  frameworks, and implementation mechanisms .   The country has shown continuing progress in  efforts to improve AML enforcement by increasing money laundering investigations,  prosecutions, and convictions.    One key area for development is the prosecution of foreign- sourced crimes.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nThe UN and the IMF place Malaysia among the top countries with high illicit financial outflows.   It is estimated Malaysia’s illicit financial outflows account for   $\\S33.74$   billion, which ranks it fifth  among all countries for illicit capital flight, but number one on a per capita basis.  Malaysia  accounted for approximately 6 percent of total illicit financial flows for all developing countries.  "}

Its most recent MER is  available at:  http://www.menafatf.org/information-center/menafatf-publications/anti-money- laundering-and-counter-terrorist-financing.  \nAML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES \nInternational experts have noted a number of areas for improvement in Morocco’s AML/CFT  regime, including the need for greater national coordination, the lack of a declaration system for  cross-border currency transportation reporting, and legal, regulatory, and policy issues impeding  the effective implementation of supervisory and criminal enforcement actions.    \nMoney laundering is classified as a misdemeanor in Morocco.   \nENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS \nMorocco works closely with international partners, has implemented applicable multilateral  agreements, and has voluntarily initiated exchanges with private sector partners to address key  vulnerabilities.  \nThe UTRF retains its key role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence.  It also assesses  systemic risk, disseminates information to financial entities, and communicates with banks, other  financial entities, and government authorities to facilitate information sharing, capacity building,  and coordination.  However, its analytic capabilities, interagency cooperation, and the ability of  law enforcement to access information are problematic.  Replies to inquiries concerning  suspected money laundering-related activities are rare, and there appears to be little oversight  concerning the origin of large cash deposits.  \nLaw enforcement does not effectively use financial intelligence to identify money laundering or  to enhance ongoing predicate investigations by tracing proceeds or recovering assets.  The UTRF  refers some information to law enforcement, but use of this information to conduct financial  investigations and pursue money laundering investigations appears infrequent.  Prosecutions and  convictions for money laundering are low in relation to the large number of predicate crimes that  are pursued by authorities—from 2013-2018, there was only one conviction for money  "}

The UCSI meets with President Cortizo weekly to provide\nprogress updates. Since July 2019, Panama has drafted and introduced substantive AML\nlegislation, including draft legislation to create a registry of registered agent and beneficial\nownership information.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nMoney laundered in Panama frequently comes from illegal activities abroad, including drug\ntrafficking, tax crimes, and the smuggling of people and goods. Panama is a drug transshipment\ncountry due to its location along major trafficking routes. Criminals launder money via bulk\ncash smuggling and trade at airports and seaports, shell companies, real estate and construction,\ncasinos, virtual currencies, and the 12 active FTZs. Smuggling through ports may be facilitated\nby corruption.\n\nLegal entities and arrangements created and registered in Panama, such as corporations, private\nfoundations, and trusts, are at high risk for laundering activity. The use of nominee shareholders\nand directors is still prevalent, and Panama still lacks a mechanism to determine final beneficial\nownership.\n\nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nLegislation criminalizes money laundering and sets AML compliance requirements for entities in\n31 sectors. Panama has comprehensive CDD and STR requirements.\n\nLaw 70, signed on January 31, 2019, criminalizes tax evasion and fraud of more than $300,000\nand defines tax crimes as money laundering predicates. However, the law includes an exception\nstating if the offender pays the tax obligation in full during the investigative phase, the criminal\naction against such offender would be dropped. Following international criticism of the\nunlimited exception provision, the Cortizo administration introduced a bill to amend Law 70 to\nallow an individual one use of the exception. As of December 2019, the National Assembly\npassed several amendments to the bill that are awaiting President Cortizo’s signature. The\n$300,000 prosecution threshold may also limit the effectiveness of investigations into laundering\nlinked to lower amounts of taxes evaded.\n\nIn 2017, Panama published its first national risk assessment (NRA), which identifies FTZs, real\nestate, construction, and lawyers as high-risk sectors.

The UCSI meets with President Cortizo weekly to provide  progress updates.  Since July 2019, Panama has drafted and introduced substantive AML  legislation, including draft legislation to create a registry of registered agent and beneficial  ownership information.     \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nMoney laundered in Panama frequently comes from illegal activities abroad, including drug  trafficking, tax crimes, and the smuggling of people and goods.  Panama is a drug transshipment  country due to its location along major trafficking routes.  Criminals launder money via bulk  cash smuggling and trade at airports and seaports, shell companies, real estate and construction,  casinos, virtual currencies, and the 12 active FTZs.  Smuggling through ports may be facilitated  by corruption.  \nLegal entities and arrangements created and registered in Panama, such as corporations, private  foundations, and trusts, are at high risk for laundering activity.  The use of nominee shareholders  and directors is still prevalent, and Panama still lacks a mechanism to determine final beneficial  ownership.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nLegislation criminalizes money laundering and sets AML compliance requirements for entities in  31 sectors.  Panama has comprehensive CDD and STR requirements.  \nLaw 70, signed on January 31, 2019, criminalizes tax evasion and fraud of more than  $\\mathbb{S300,000}$    and defines tax crimes as money laundering predicates.  However, the law includes an exception  stating if the offender pays the tax obligation in full during the investigative phase, the criminal  action against such offender would be dropped.  Following international criticism of the  unlimited exception provision, the Cortizo administration introduced a bill to amend Law 70 to  allow an individual one use of the exception.  As of December 2019, the National Assembly  passed several amendments to the bill that are awaiting President Cortizo’s signature.  The   $\\mathbb{S300,000}$   prosecution threshold may also limit the effectiveness of investigations into laundering  linked to lower amounts of taxes evaded.   \nIn 2017, Panama published its first national risk assessment (NRA), which identifies FTZs, real  estate, construction, and lawyers as high-risk sectors.  Panama is updating its NRA to address  terrorism financing risks.  Authorities indicated the draft is expected to be completed in early  2020.    \nPanama is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.

The widespread use of cash,  MVTS,  hawaladars, and new payment methods present money laundering vulnerabilities.   Mobile payment systems, such as Wari and Joni-Joni, cater to unbanked Senegalese.  Wari  discontinued its implementation of KYC software due to problems with its platform.  Resource  constraints prevent effective AML supervision of these entities.   \nTouba is an autonomous municipality under the jurisdiction of the Mouride religious  brotherhood.  As the center of a worldwide network of Mouride communities, Touba is the  destination for a significant portion of remittances.  Wari recorded remittances of  $\\S2$   million per  day shortly after opening a new service for Touba.  These facts, combined with the national  government’s limited authority in the city, make Touba vulnerable to money laundering.   \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   \nSenegal adopted the 2018 AML/CFT law, derived from the West African Economic and  Monetary Union (WAEMU) uniform law, and the NRA, with its 2017-2019 action plan.  The  WAEMU uniform law contains deficiencies with respect to international AML/CFT standards  that persist across WAEMU countries, notably on suspicious activity reporting and CDD.   Senegalese authorities and financial institutions continue to rely heavily on the Central Bank of  West African Countries.    \nIn September 2019, Senegal issued three decrees.  The decrees create the National Anti-Money  Laundering Committee to strengthen domestic coordination, enhance supervision of DNFBPs,  and reorganize the FIU as an autonomous entity.  \nLegislation introduces the legal concept of beneficial owners, a concept not previously  recognized.

Local drug sales in transit through Suriname are usually conducted in U.S.  dollars, which may be deposited domestically.   \nGoods such as agricultural products, fuel, cigarettes, alcohol, and medicine are smuggled into the  country via neighboring Guyana and French Guiana and sold at below-market prices, but there is  little evidence to suggest this smuggling is funded by narcotics trafficking or other illicit activity.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   \nSuriname did not pass or amend AML legislation in 2019.  Suriname is drafting amendments to  the Disclosure of Unusual Transactions Act to meet international standards.  KYC and STR  requirements cover banks and credit unions, asset managers, securities brokers and dealers,  insurance agents and companies, currency brokers, remitters, exchanges, auditors, accountants,  notaries, lawyers, real estate agents, dealers in gold or other precious metals and stones, gaming  entities and lotteries, and motor vehicle dealers.  The FIU registered 118 new DNFBPs and is  taking steps to join the Egmont Group.  In March 2019, President Bouterse signed a resolution  requiring government agencies to cooperate with the national risk assessment (NRA) process.   "}

Unregulated Thai and  Chinese remittance systems are also prevalent.   \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nThailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) has been amended several times since its  initial passage in 1999, broadening the overall scope of criminal liability and increasing powers  to conduct investigations and make seizures.  Tax offenses, terrorism, and proliferation are  money laundering predicate offenses.    \nAMLA Section 22 includes KYC and STR requirements.  The Anti-Money Laundering Office  (AMLO) acts as the country’s FIU.  It is responsible for supervision of all reporting entities and  is the key AML/CFT enforcement agency.  Financial institutions are required to keep customer  identification and financial transaction data for five years from termination of relationship.  They  must also keep due diligence records for ten years.  Penalties for violating reporting requirements  can include potential asset seizure.  \nThailand has varying reporting requirements for the import and export of currency.  At airports,  amounts exceeding approximately  $\\mathbb{S}15{,}000$   (450,000 Thai baht) must be declared to Customs.   Approval from the Bank of Thailand is required to take Thai currency (cash) in amounts  exceeding approximately  $\\S1,700$   (50,000 Thai baht) out of the country.  The threshold is higher  at approximately  $\\S61{,}500$   (2 million Thai baht) for Thai currency destined for Cambodia, Laos,  Burma, Vietnam, Malaysia, and China’s Yunnan province.  For fund transfers to commercial  banks, foreign (non-Thai) currency can be transferred into Thailand without limit.  However, the  deposit must be transferred into an authorized bank and either be exchanged into Thai baht or  held in a foreign currency account.   "}

Additionally, officials should conduct more inquiries into large, cross- border cash flows.    \nUnited Kingdom   \nOVERVIEW  \nThe UK plays a leading role in European and world finance and remains one of the strongest  global actors in combatting illicit finance.  Money laundering presents a significant risk to the  UK because of the size, sophistication, and reputation of its financial and real estate markets.   UK law enforcement combats cash-based money laundering, the drug trade, and high-end money  laundering through the financial sector and professional services.  In July 2019, the UK  published its Economic Crime Plan, which describes public and private sector actions over the  next three years to protect the UK against economic crime.  The UK should follow through on  plans to strengthen the capabilities of the FIU, reduce inconsistencies in the supervisory regime,  and increase its international reach to tackle money laundering.   \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nCash-based and high-end money laundering remain the greatest areas of risk to the UK.  The  main methods of laundering are cash collection networks, international controllers, and MSBs.   Professional services are a gateway for criminals to disguise the origins of funds using legal,  accountancy, and company service providers to set up corporate structures for money laundering  purposes.     \nIntelligence gaps persist, particularly in relation to high-end money laundering, where the  proceeds are held in complex trading arrangements, real estate, or other investments rather than  cash.  This type of laundering is often used to launder the proceeds of major frauds and foreign  corruption.  UK law enforcement agencies have taken steps to fill these gaps, leading to a better  understanding of the risk.    "}

Vietnam will need political will and better coordination within the government to  improve enforcement of existing AML laws.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nSources of illicit funds include corruption; assets purchased by foreign entities to avoid tax  obligations in the country of origin, fraud, illegal gaming, prostitution, counterfeiting of goods,  and trafficking in persons, drugs, and wildlife.  Remittances from Vietnamese organized crime  groups in Asia, Europe, and North America continue to be significant sources of illicit funds,  including proceeds from narcotics and trafficked wildlife products transiting or destined for  Vietnam.  \nVietnam remains a predominantly cash-based economy.
