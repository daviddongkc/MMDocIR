American diplomacy is  founded on four key pillars:\n\n \n   Security: Establishing and maintain security within and  among nations in order to respond to challenges and  opportunities\n\n    Prosperity: Creating political, economic, and financial  foundations that allow for investment, trade, and  entrepreneurship\n\n    Democracy: Working to expand transparent,  responsible, and responsive governments that support  human rights and equality\n\n    Development: Collaborating with nations and  communities to meet the needs of citizens through  better access to health care, education, and economic  opportunity. \nThe people who work to uphold the pillars of American  diplomacy are called diplomats. U.S. diplomats’ primary  mission is to carry out the foreign policy of the United  States. They do this by using personal and professional  relationships with officials and citizens of the host country  to advocate for American interests, to work together on  common causes, and to explain American society and values. \nDiplomats work in a variety of locations, both domestic and  international. An embassy is an international location where  a diplomat may work.

The  Department reports earned revenues regardless of whether  it is permitted to retain the revenue or remit it to Treasury.  Revenue from other Federal agencies must be established  and billed based on actual costs, without profit. Revenue  from the public, in the form of fees for service (e.g., visa  issuance), is also without profit. Consular fees are established  on a cost-recovery basis and determined by periodic cost  studies. Certain fees, such as the machine readable Border  Crossing Cards, are determined statutorily. Revenue from  reimbursable agreements is received to perform services  overseas for other Federal agencies. The FSRDF receives  revenue from employee/employer contributions, a U.S.  Government contribution, and investment interest. Other  revenues come from ICASS billings and Working Capital  Fund earnings. \nEarned revenues totaled   $\\S7.4$   billion in 2021, and are  depicted, by program source, in the “Earned Revenues by  Program Source” pie chart.

These funds provided humanitarian assistance and  resettlement opportunities for refugees and conflict victims  around the globe and contributed to key multilateral and  non-governmental organizations that address pressing  humanitarian needs overseas. Additionally, MRA funding  provided in the ARP will be used to help prevent, prepare  for, and respond to COVID-19 in existing complex  emergency responses, and to address the potential  humanitarian consequences of the pandemic. \nIn 2021, the portion of the Global Health Programs  appropriation managed by the Department totaled   $\\S5.9$    billion. This is the primary source of funding for the  President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. These funds  are used to control the epidemic through data-driven  investments that strategically target geographic areas and  population where the initiative can achieve the most impact  for its investments. \nThe 2021 International Organizations and Programs   $(\\mathrm{{IC}}\\&{\\mathrm{{IP}})}$   totaled   $\\S967.5$   million,   $\\S387.5$   million in enduring  funding and  $\\S580.0$   million provided in the ARP . It  provided international organizations voluntary contributions  that advanced U.S. strategic goals by supporting and  enhancing international consultation and coordination. This  approach is required in transnational areas where solutions  to problems are best addressed globally, such as protecting  the ozone layer or safeguarding international air traffic. In  other areas, the United States can multiply its influence and  effectiveness through support for international programs. \nForeign Assistance Accounts Fully Implemented by USAID \nUSAID fully implements the following accounts:  Global Health Programs-USAID, International Disaster  Assistance, Food for Peace, Development Assistance,  Transition Initiatives, Complex Crises Fund, and USAID  Administrative accounts, including Operating Expenses, the  Capital Investment Fund, and the Office of the Inspector  General. The 2021 appropriated total for those accounts is   $\\S19.6$   billion. \nThe image shows a formal meeting setup in a conference room with a large round table covered with a beige tablecloth. Various individuals are seated around the table. In the background, there are multiple flags, likely representing different countries, displayed against a blue curtain. A chandelier hangs from the ceiling. Two large screens with imagery are positioned on both sides of the room.\n\nThe caption states: \"Secretary Blinken meets with the Foreign Ministers of Central American Nations and Mexico on Shared Migration Challenges at the Palace Hotel in New York City, New York, September 23, 2021.\"\n\nThe image is credited to the Department of State.\nJointly Implemented Foreign Assistance Accounts \nThe Department and USAID jointly implement funds  from the Assistance for Europe, Eurasia, and Central Asia  and the Economic Support Fund (ESF) accounts. Congress  provided  $\\S13.3$   billion for these two accounts in 2021 to  advance national security and support programs focused  on democracy, anti-corruption, and rule of law. This total  includes   $\\S8.7$   billion in funding under ESF authorities in  the ARP for COVID response. This funding also helps  countries of strategic importance meet near- and long-term  political, economic, development, and security needs. \nAnother jointly managed account is the Democracy Fund  account. The Democracy Fund appropriation totaled   $\\S290.7$   million in 2021; the funds are split and made  available for both the Department and USAID. Funding  in this account promotes democracy in priority countries  where egregious human rights violations occur, democracy  and human rights advocates are under pressure, governments  are not democratic or are in transition, where there is  growing demand for human rights and democracy, and for  programs promoting Internet Freedom. \n2022 Foreign Assistance Request \nThe President’s 2022 Request for foreign assistance for  the Department of State and USAID is currently under  congressional consideration. The State and USAID request  for foreign assistance is   $\\S43.0$   billion to support all core  programs; no OCO funding is requested. The total includes   $\\S1.8$   billion in continuing resolution anomalies for disaster  relief for Afghan evacuees. Taken together, the Department  of State fully managed accounts sum to  $\\S21.1$   billion or  roughly half of the total request.  "}

The Department conducted its evaluation of financial  management systems for compliance with FFMIA in  accordance with OMB Circular A‐123, Appendix D.  Based on the results of this assessment, the Department  can provide reasonable assurance that its overall financial  management systems substantially comply with principles,  standards, and requirements prescribed by the FFMIA as  of September 30, 2021. \nThe image contains a signature that reads \"Antony Blinken.\"\nAntony J. Blinken Secretary of State November 15, 2021  \nIn its Report on Compliance with Laws, Regulations,  Contracts, and Grant Agreements, the Independent  Auditor identified instances of substantial noncompliance  with Federal financial management systems requirements.  The Independent Auditors asserted that the Department’s  financial management systems inherit certain controls  from the overall information security program as identified  in the FISMA audit, and that these weaknesses support a  non-compliance finding. The Department acknowledges  these weaknesses in our financial management systems that  were described in the FISMA report. OMB’s Appendix D  provides a revised compliance model that entails a risk-and  outcome-based approach to assess FFMIA compliance. In  our assessments and evaluations, the Department identified  similar weaknesses, e.g., the Department has multiple  low value financial systems that do not have current  Authorizations-to-Operate on file. However, applying the  guidance and the assessment framework noted in Appendix  D to OMB Circular A-123, the Department considers them  deficiencies versus substantial non-conformances relative to  substantial compliance with the requirements of the FFMIA.  Nonetheless, the Department is committed to continuing to  work to address all identified financial management system  deficiencies that are beneficial and cost-effective use of  government funds. \nFederal Information Security  Modernization Act \nThe Federal Information Security Modernization Act  of 2014 (FISMA) requires Federal agencies to develop,  document, and implement an agency-wide program to  protect government information and information systems  that support the operations and assets of the agency. FISMA  authorized the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  to take a leadership and oversight role in this effort, created  cyber breach notification requirements, and modified  the scope of reportable information from primarily  policies and financial information to specific information  about threats, security incidents, and compliance with  security requirements. \nThe Department remains committed to adopting the  best cybersecurity practices and embedding them into the  agency’s culture. As a result, the agency continues to improve  its cybersecurity posture and provide transparency internally  and with external partners in other Federal agencies. \nThe Department’s 2021 Annual FISMA Report  demonstrates the Department’s continued efforts to improve  IT security by prioritizing and aligning initiatives with  Executive Order 14028.

During the  layover, Koob bought a wool beret and wore it during the  many welcome-home events held for the returning hostages.  She donated her beret to the National Museum of American  Diplomacy (NMAD) collection in 2019. In addition to the  beret, Koob gave NMAD a cross necklace, a replica of what  became known as the “Hostage Cross.” A member of Koob’s  former congregation in Alexandria, Virginia, designed the  cross for the season of Lent and sent a copy to Kate and one  of her colleagues during their captivity. \nFollowing her captivity, Koob resumed her Foreign Service  career. She retired in 1996. Koob regularly talks about her  experience as a hostage, especially with school-aged children.  “When they study history, they need to know it happened to  real people.” Kate Koob’s story continues to be an excellent  example of American diplomatic courage and composure.  \nThis black and white image shows a group of people gathered, likely on an airport tarmac. Several uniformed military personnel are present, and civilians appear to be interacting with them, possibly in a greeting or farewell scenario. Some people are holding flowers, suggesting a welcoming or celebratory event. The atmosphere seems formal and crowded.\nFreed Iranian hostage Kathryn Koob reaches out to shake hands with  the receiving line after her arrival at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,  January 27, 1981.

In making those risk assessments, the auditor  considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial  statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate under the circumstances, but  not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control.

During FY 2021, the audit continued to identify\ncontrol limitations, and we concluded that the combination of control deficiencies remained a\nsignificant deficiency. The individual deficiencies we identified are summarized as follows:\n\nSupport of Obligations — Obligations are definite commitments that create a legal liability\nof the Government for payment. The Department should record only legitimate\nobligations, which include a reasonable estimate of potential future outlays. We identified\nnumerous low-value obligations (i.e., obligations that are $5 or less) for which the\nDepartment could not provide evidence of a binding agreement. The Department’s\nfinancial system is designed to reject payments for invoices without established\nobligations. As in past years, we found that allotment holders did not always record valid\nand accurate obligations prior to the receipt of goods and services; therefore, the\nDepartment established low-value obligations that allowed invoices to be paid in\ncompliance with the Prompt Payment Act.* This process effectively bypassed system\ncontrols. The continued use of this practice could lead to a violation of the Antideficiency\nAct® and increases the risk of fraud, misuse, and waste.\n\nTimeliness of Obligations — The Department should record an obligation in its financial\nmanagement system when it enters into an agreement, such as a contract or a purchase\norder, to purchase goods and services. During the audit, we identified several obligations\nthat were not recorded within 15 days of executing the obligating document and that were\nrecorded in the financial management system prior to the execution of the obligating\ndocument.

Budgetary Accounting  \nThe Department lacked sufficient reliable funds control over its accounting and business  processes to ensure budgetary transactions were properly recorded, monitored, and reported.  Beginning in our report on the Department’s FY 2010 financial statements, we identified  budgetary accounting as a significant deficiency. During FY 2021, the audit continued to identify  control limitations, and we concluded that the combination of control deficiencies remained a  significant deficiency. The individual deficiencies we identified are summarized as follows:  \n•   Support of Obligations – Obligations are definite commitments that create a legal liability  of the Government for payment.

Specifically, we determined that eight of nine domains included in the “FY 2021  Inspector General Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA)  Reporting Metrics, Version 1.1” were operating below an effective level.  The  Department’s financial management systems inherit certain controls from the overall  information security program. Therefore, several of the control weaknesses identified  during the FISMA audit impact the Department’s financial management systems.  Examples of deficiencies that we consider to be significant for our determination of  FFMIA compliance include:  "}

Except for contractor-held vehicles  in Iraq and Afghanistan, depreciation is calculated on a  straight-line basis over the asset’s estimated life and begins  when the property is placed into service. Contractor-held  vehicles in Iraq and Afghanistan, due to the harsh operating  conditions, are depreciated on a double-declining balance  basis. The estimated useful lives for personal property are  as follows:  \nThe table lists different categories of assets along with their respective estimated useful life span in years. Here's a breakdown of the information in the table:\n\n1. **Aircraft:**\n   - INL air wing managed: 10 years\n   - Host-country managed: 5 years\n\n2. **Vehicles:**\n   - Department managed: 3 to 6 years\n   - Contractor-held in Iraq and Afghanistan: 2.5 years\n\n3. **Security Equipment:** 3 to 15 years\n\n4. **Communication Equipment:** 3 to 20 years\n\n5. **ADP Equipment:** 3 to 6 years\n\n6. **Reproduction Equipment:** 3 to 15 years\n\n7. **Internal Use Software:** Estimated useful life or 5 years\n\nThis table provides the expected duration for which these assets are considered useful before they need to be replaced, based on typical wear and tear or obsolescence.\nCapital Leases \nLeases are accounted for as capital leases if the value is   $\\S1$   million or more and they meet one of the following  criteria: (1) the lease transfers ownership of the property by  the end of the lease term; (2) the lease contains an option to  purchase the property at a bargain price; (3) the lease term  is equal to or greater than 75 percent of the estimated useful  life of the property; or (4) at the inception of the lease,  the present value of the minimum lease payment equals or  exceeds 90 percent of the fair value of the leased property.  The initial recording of a lease’s value (with a corresponding  liability) is the lesser of the net present value of the lease  payments or the fair value of the leased property. Capital  leases that meet criteria (1) or (2) are depreciated over the  useful life of the asset (30 years). Capital leases that meet  criteria (3) or (4) are depreciated over the term of the lease.  Capital lease liabilities are amortized over the term of the  lease; if the lease has an indefinite term, the term is capped  at 50 years. Additional information on capital leases is  disclosed in Note 11,  Leases . \nStewardship Property and Equipment – Heritage Assets \nStewardship Property and Equipment, or Heritage Assets,  are assets that have historical or natural significance; are  of cultural, educational, or artistic importance; or have  significant architectural characteristics. They are generally  considered priceless and are expected to be preserved  indefinitely. As such, these assets are reported in terms of  physical units rather than cost or other monetary values.

These estimates are based on  management’s best knowledge of current events, historical  experience, actions the Department may take in the future,  and various other assumptions that are believed to be  reasonable under the circumstances. Due to the size and  complexity of many of the Department’s programs, the  estimates are subject to a wide range of variables, including  assumptions on future economic and financial events.  Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates. \nZ. Comparative Data \nCertain 2020 amounts have been reclassified to conform  to the 2021 presentation. The Consolidated Balance Sheet  and Note 8,  Other Liabilities , presentation has been updated  to conform to OMB Circular A-136,  Financial Reporting  Requirements , revised. \n 2   Fund Balance with Treasury \n\nThe table summarizes the status of the Fund Balance with Treasury as of September 30 for the years 2021 and 2020, with values presented in millions of dollars.

Further, the Department was granted  additional property in Kabul shortly before operations were  suspended. Due to the proximity of the property grant to  the suspension of operations and the current uncertainty  in the real estate market in Kabul, the Department has  used alternative valuations to estimate and report the fair  value of this property. The overall financial impact to the  Department’s General Property and Equipment, Net, as  a result of the suspension of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul  and South Compound grant, is a decrease in the net book  value of   $\\S93$   million.

The FSRDS and the FSPS are defined-benefit,\n\n88 | UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE\n\nsingle-employer plans. FSRDS was originally established\nin 1924; FSPS in 1986. The FSRDS is a single-benefit\n\nretirement plan. Retirees receive a monthly annuity from\nFSRDS for the rest of their lives. FSPS provides benefits\nfrom three sources: a basic benefit (annuity) from FSPS,\n\nSocial Security, and the TSP.\n\nThe Department’s financial statements present the Pension\nActuarial Liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and\nDisability Program (the “Plan”) as the actuarial present\nvalue of projected plan benefits, as required by the SFFAS\nNo. 33, Pensions, Other Retirement Benefits, and other Post\nEmployment Benefits: Reporting the Gains and Losses from\nChanges in Assumptions and Selecting Discount Rates and\nValuation Dates. The Pension Actuarial Liability represents\nthe future periodic payments provided for current\nemployee and retired Plan participants, less the future\nemployee and employing Federal agency contributions,\n\nstated in current dollars.\n\nFuture periodic payments include benefits expected to\n\nbe paid to (1) retired or terminated employees or their\nbeneficiaries; (2) beneficiaries of employees who have died;\nand (3) present employees or their beneficiaries, including\nrefunds of employee contributions as specified by Plan\nprovisions. Total projected service is used to determine\neligibility for retirement benefits. The value of voluntary,\ninvoluntary, and deferred retirement benefits is based on\nprojected service and assumed salary increases.

FSRDS was originally established  in 1924; FSPS in 1986. The FSRDS is a single-benefit  retirement plan. Retirees receive a monthly annuity from  FSRDS for the rest of their lives. FSPS provides benefits  from three sources: a basic benefit (annuity) from FSPS,  Social Security, and the TSP \nThe Department’s financial statements present the Pension  Actuarial Liability of the Foreign Service Retirement and  Disability Program (the “Plan”) as the actuarial present  value of projected plan benefits, as required by the SFFAS  No. 33,  Pensions, Other Retirement Benefits, and other Post  Employment Benefits: Reporting the Gains and Losses from  Changes in Assumptions and Selecting Discount Rates and  Valuation Dates.  The Pension Actuarial Liability represents  the future periodic payments provided for current  employee and retired Plan participants, less the future  employee and employing Federal agency contributions,  stated in current dollars. \nFuture periodic payments include benefits expected to  be paid to (1) retired or terminated employees or their  beneficiaries; (2) beneficiaries of employees who have died;  and (3) present employees or their beneficiaries, including  refunds of employee contributions as specified by Plan  provisions. Total projected service is used to determine  eligibility for retirement benefits. The value of voluntary,  involuntary, and deferred retirement benefits is based on  projected service and assumed salary increases. The value of  benefits for disabled employees or survivors of employees  is determined by multiplying the benefit the employee or  survivor would receive on the date of disability or death,  by a ratio of service at the valuation date to projected  service at the time of disability or death. \nThe Pension Actuarial Liability is calculated by applying  actuarial assumptions to adjust the projected plan benefits  to reflect the discounted time value of money and the  probability of payment (by means of decrements such as  death, disability, withdrawal or retirement) between the  valuation date and the expected date of payment. The Plan  uses the aggregate entry age normal actuarial cost method,  whereby the present value of projected benefits for each  employee is allocated on a level basis (such as a constant  percentage of salary) over the employee’s service between  entry age and assumed exit age. The portion of the present  value allocated to each year is referred to as the normal cost. \nThe FSRDF finances the operations of the FSRDS and  the FSPS.

The increase in 2020 was primarily due to  actuarial losses due to experience. \nFor the UK plan in 2021, the decrease in the net defined  benefit liability was primarily due to investment returns on  plan assets. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to a  lump-sum contribution to fund the deficit. \nThe tables below show the changes in the projected  benefit obligation and plan assets during 2021 and 2020  for the Germany and UK plans  (dollars in millions). \nThe table shows the changes in benefit obligations for two years, 2020 and 2021. It details the following components:\n\n1. **Benefit Obligations Beginning of Year**:\n   - 2021: $462\n   - 2020: $415\n\n2. **Service Cost**:\n   - 2021: $10\n   - 2020: $7\n\n3. **Interest Cost**:\n   - 2021: $13\n   - 2020: $31\n\n4. **Other**:\n   - 2021: $3\n   - 2020: $9\n\n5. **Benefit Obligations End of Year**:\n   - 2021: $488\n   - 2020: $462\n\nThe table highlights how each component contributes to the total change in benefit obligations from the beginning to the end of each year.\nThe table shows changes in plan assets for the years 2021 and 2020. Here's a summary of the information:\n\n- **Fair Value of Plan Assets Beginning of Year**: \n  - 2021: $445\n  - 2020: $376\n\n- **Return on Plan Assets**: \n  - 2021: $60\n  - 2020: $25\n\n- **Contributions Less Benefits Paid**: \n  - 2021: $(3)\n  - 2020: $23\n\n- **Other**: \n  - 2021: $(15)\n  - 2020: $21\n\n- **Fair Value of Plan Assets End of Year**: \n  - 2021: $487\n  - 2020: $445\n\n- **Net Defined Benefit Liability**: \n  - 2021: $1\n  - 2020: $17\nThe table compares the distribution of different financial assets for the years 2021 and 2020.

It includes three key financial indicators: \n\n1. **Discount Rate**:\n   - 2021: Ranges from 2.10% to 3.80%\n   - 2020: Ranges from 2.75% to 4.60%\n\n2. **Salary Increase Rate**:\n   - 2021: Ranges from 2.25% to 3.80%\n   - 2020: Ranges from 2.25% to 4.10%\n\n3. **Pension Increase Rate**:\n   - 2021: Ranges from 1.75% to 2.80%\n   - 2020: Ranges from 1.75% to 3.10%\n\nThese rates reflect the assumptions used in actuarial calculations for financial assessments or planning purposes for each respective year.\nRetirement and Voluntary Severance Lump Sum Payments  \nIn 76 countries, FSN employees are provided a lump-sum  separation payment when they resign, retire, or otherwise  separate through no fault of their own. The amount of  the payment is generally based on length of service, rate of  pay at the time of separation, and the type of separation.  As of September 30, 2021, approximately 24,000 FSNs  participate in such plans. \nThe cost method used for the valuation of the liabilities  associated with these plans is the Projected Unit Credit   actuarial cost method. The participant’s benefit is first  determined using both their projected service and salary  at the retirement date. The projected benefit is then  multiplied by the ratio of current service to projected service  at retirement in order to determine an allocated benefit.  The Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO) for the entire plan  is calculated as the sum of the individual PBO amounts for  each active member. Further, this calculation requires certain  actuarial assumptions be made, such as voluntary withdraws,  assumed retirement age, death and disability, as well as  economic assumptions. For economic assumptions, available  market data was scarce for many of the countries where  eligible posts are located. Due to the lack of creditable global  market data, an approach consistent with that used for  the September 30, 2021, FSRDF valuations under SFFAS  No. 33 was adopted. Using this approach, the economic  assumptions used for the Retirement and Voluntary  Severance Lump Sum Payment liability as of September 30,  2021 and 2020, are: \nThe table presents three economic metrics for the years 2021 and 2020: the Discount Rate, Rate of Inflation, and Salary Increase.\n\n- **Discount Rate**: \n  - 2021: 2.52%\n  - 2020: 2.74%\n\n- **Rate of Inflation**: \n  - 2021: Varies\n  - 2020: 1.69%\n\n- **Salary Increase**: \n  - 2021: Ranges from 3.00% to 12.00%\n  - 2020: 4.86%\nIn 2021, there was a change in the methodology for  developing actuarial assumptions.  As a result, the salary  increase rates no longer include an explicit rate of inflation.  The current salary increase rates are assumed to implicitly  reflect both merit and local inflation. "}

As a result of these reviews, we classify and adjust  our contingent liability when we think it is probable that  there will be an unfavorable outcome and when a reasonable  estimate of the amount can be made. \nAdditionally, as part of our continuing evaluation of estimates  required in the preparation of our financial statements, we  evaluated the materiality of cases determined to have either a  probable or reasonably possible chance of an adverse outcome.  \nAs a result of these reviews, the Department believes that claims  considered probable could result in estimable losses of   $\\S72$    to  $\\S236$   million and reasonably possible claims could result  in potential estimable losses of   $\\S13$   to  $\\S121$   million if the  outcomes were unfavorable to the Department. The probable  cases involve claims related to international claims made  against the United States, Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission claims, grievances, consulate construction, Equal  Access to Justice, Freedom of Information, and contract  appeals. The reasonably possible cases involve contract disputes,  claims related to embassy construction, sale of United States  real property overseas dispute, Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission claims, and international claims made against the  United States being litigated by the Department.

Accordingly, the pricing policy for any earned revenue  depends on the revenue’s nature, and the statutory authority  under which the Department is allowed to earn and  retain (or not retain) the revenue. Earned revenue that the  Department is not authorized to retain is deposited into the  Treasury’s General Fund. \nThe FSRDF finances the operations of the FSRDS and  the FSPS. The FSRDF receives revenue from employee/ employer contributions, a U.S. Government contribution,  and interest on investments. By law, FSRDS participants  contribute 7.25 percent of their base salary, and each  employing agency contributes 7.25 percent; FSPS  participants contribute 1.35 percent, 3.65 percent, or 4.95  percent of their base salary depending on their start date  and each employing agency contributes 20.22 percent  or 17.92 percent. Employing agencies report employee/ employer contributions biweekly. Total employee/employer  contributions for 2021 and 2020 were  $\\S428$   million and   $\\S416$   million, respectively. \nThe FSRDF also receives a U.S. Government contribution  to finance (1) FSRDS benefits not funded by employee/ employer contributions; (2) interest on FSRDS unfunded  liability; (3) FSRDS disbursements attributable to military  service; and (4) FSPS supplemental liability payment. The  U.S. Government contributions for 2021 and 2020 were   $\\S481$   million and   $\\S456$   million, respectively. FSRDF cash  resources are invested in special non-marketable securities  issued by the Treasury. Total interest earned on these  investments for 2021 and 2020 were  $\\S473$   million and   $\\S552$  million, respectively. \nConsular Fees are established primarily on a cost-recovery  basis and are determined by periodic cost studies. Certain  fees, such as the machine readable Border Crossing Cards, are  determined statutorily. Reimbursable Agreements with Federal  agencies are established and billed on a cost-recovery basis.  ICASS billings are computed on a cost-recovery basis; billings  are calculated to cover all operating, overhead, and replacement  costs of capital assets, based on budget submissions, budget  updates, and other factors. In addition to services covered  under ICASS, the Department provides administrative support  to other agencies overseas for which the Department does  "}

Families, friends, and communities were cut  off from each other. And those who dared to cross from  communist East Berlin to democratic West Berlin risked  their lives. By the late 1980s, however, the communist hold  over Eastern Europe was slipping, and residents of East  Berlin, yearning for freedom, began to demonstrate for their  rights. On the night of November 9, 1989, some courageous  ones breached the wall. Thousands followed over the next  two days, and international media captured unforgettable  images of them crossing peacefully into West Berlin. For  many, those images mark the end of the Cold War and   the victory of democracy over communism. \nToday, the National Museum of American Diplomacy  (NMAD) is home to the “Signature Segment” of the  Berlin Wall.

The environment suggests a scenario that could be related to migration or evacuation, as there are a significant number of people gathered closely on a single vessel.

Department of State  \nO n April 30, 1975, the South Vietnamese capital of  Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese Army effectively  ending the Vietnam War. In the days before, U.S. forces  evacuated thousands of Americans and South Vietnamese.  American diplomats were on the frontlines, organizing  what would be the most ambitious helicopter evacuation in  history. The logistics of issuing visas and evacuating these  Vietnamese and American citizens were not glamorous but  were essential.  \nWhile Saigon was falling, the rest of South Vietnam also  was evacuating as quickly as possible. Approximately 100  miles away in C ầ n Th ơ , one diplomat saved hundreds  of Vietnamese refugees by devising and leading a risky  evacuation. Francis Terry McNamara served as Consul  General in C ầ n Th ơ , Vietnam at the time of the U.S.  evacuation. The U.S. Embassy for expediency and security  reasons was only going to provide helicopters with enough  room to evacuate the 18 or so American employees.  McNamara said Saigon could have the consulate’s  \nhelicopters now, rather than in six hours after evacuating  Americans, if McNamara could evacuate everyone, including  Vietnamese staff, by boat. \nUtilizing his skills as a former sailor, McNamara  commandeered some barges with help from a USAID  colleague. McNamara captained the convoy down a Mekong  Delta tributary, at one point being stopped by the South  Vietnamese Navy and taking fire from Viet Cong troops.  The barge bobbed in the open sea for a few hours until  lights could be seen. They were from an American freighter  contracted by the CIA for evacuations.

Grants officer involvement in the post-award  management of awards is necessary to ensure awards   achieve programmatic objectives and that recipients use  funds in accordance with Federal regulations. OIG noted,  however, the officers did not maintain the required post- \naward documentation in the award files. OIG found that   in its review of 27 award files totaling more than  $\\S100$    million, 12 had partial documentation and 5 had no  documentation at all. \nMoreover, the grants officers told OIG they generally did  not review implementer reporting or written evaluations  of implementer performance produced by grants officer  representative (GORs). Instead, they relied on GORs to  bring issues to their attention. \nA management assistance report on foreign assistance in  Somalia focused on deficiencies identified with the Bureau  of Administration, Office of the Procurement Executive;  Bureau of African Affairs; and Bureau of Counter terrorism  financial monitoring procedures for four selected awards.  Award recipients did not always submit financial reports  by required deadlines and the Department did not  always review the reports once they were submitted. OIG  determined that there were expenses that should not  have been paid and questioned   $\\S3.78$   million paid to one  contractor. \nIn an inspection of the Department’s Office of Fire  Protection, OIG also noted contract oversight deficiencies.  Specifically, the office’s six contracting officer’s  representatives oversaw 18 contracts valued at a total of   $\\S49.9$   million. OIG found several missing documents in  its review of 4 of 18 contracting officer’s representative files  valued at  $\\S30.3$   million.   \nAn audit at Embassy Kabul, found that while the embassy’s  Public Affairs Section (PAS) obtained performance and  financial reports for most awards OIG reviewed, six awards  were missing at least one performance report, and three  awards were missing one or more financial reports. Lastly,  PAS conducted evaluations of some of its awards but did  not comply with requirements to assess whether all of its  awards met the Department’s definition of “large” programs  for the purpose of conducting evaluations. The evaluations  are an important tool for management to determine  appropriate corrective actions for any deficiencies identified  in a timely manner. Because PAS did not determine whether  evaluations should have been conducted, PAS officials  may have missed opportunities to identify and correct  deficiencies during award implementation. "}

At the same time, some locally employed (LE)\nstaff remained behind and continued to work in the host\ncountry supporting the newly established remote mission.\nThis situation created operational and management\nchallenges for the remote mission. Because there is no\nForeign Affairs Manual (FAM) provision providing criteria\nfor when and how a remote mission should be established\n\nand instituted, OIG found that the Department’s regional\nbureaus typically collaborated with each other, relying on\ninformal advice, and utilizing ad hoc approaches when\n\nestablishing remote missions.*°\n\nAnother issue OIG identified related to the operations of\nremote missions was access to training.*° Although the\nDepartment's Office of Overseas Employment has some\nguidance on how remote missions should manage and\nsupport LE staff who continue to work in the host country\nfollowing a suspension of operations, LE staff working\n\nfor remote missions continue to face challenges accessing\nmandatory training, largely due to the fact that they do not\nhave access to OpenNet, the Department's Sensitive But\n\nUnclassified computer network.\n\nChallenges regarding contract oversight also persist in\nprograms and posts operating in contingency and critical\nenvironments. For example, a report on the Bureau of Near\nEastern Affairs (NEA) showed that NEA could improve\nthe nomination and selection of personnel to oversee\n\ncontracts in Iraq. Although the bureau had determined the\n\nappropriate certification level needed to oversee contracts\nin Iraq, it had not established the level of technical\nexpertise needed for contracting officer’s representatives\nand government technical monitors assigned. In addition,\nOIG discovered during this audit that NEA continued to\nnominate contracting officers and monitors who were not\nappropriately certified and did not demonstrate technical\n\nexpertise in the contract subject matter.>”\n\nIn another report, OIG found that short-term contracts\nawarded on a sole-source basis as “bridge contracts” were\nfrequently used in Afghanistan and Iraq over multiple\nyears to noncompetitively extend contract services beyond\nthe expiration of an original contract. The Department’s\npractice of using a short-term contract awarded on a\nsole-source basis to the incumbent contractor over several\nyears limits the Department's ability to realize potential\ncost savings by maximizing full and open competition.\nFor example, in one instance the contract was recompeted\nand resulted in saving the Department $6.8 million. The\nlack of full and open competition is also contrary to the\nCompetition in Contracting Act of 1984, which requires\ncontracting officers to promote and provide for full and\n\nopen competition.3®\n\nSimilarly, OIG found that the Department\nnoncompetitively continued Operations and Maintenance\nSupport Services (OMSS) and Baghdad Life Support\nServices (BLiSS) contracts excessively and unjustifiably\nused a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) exception\n\nfor other than full and open competition.

When operations were suspended at several embassies  reviewed in an FY 2021 audit, all of the U.S. direct-hire   staff employed at the embassies left the country, leaving  behind evacuated embassy buildings, facilities, and  equipment. At the same time, some locally employed (LE)  staff remained behind and continued to work in the host  country supporting the newly established remote mission.  This situation created operational and management  challenges for the remote mission. Because there is no  Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM) provision providing criteria  for when and how a remote mission should be established  and instituted, OIG found that the Department’s regional  bureaus typically collaborated with each other, relying on  informal advice, and utilizing ad hoc approaches when  establishing remote missions. \nAnother issue OIG identified related to the operations of  remote missions was access to training.  Although the  Department’s Office of Overseas Employment has some  guidance on how remote missions should manage and  support LE staff who continue to work in the host country  following a suspension of operations, LE staff working  for remote missions continue to face challenges accessing  mandatory training, largely due to the fact that they do not  have access to OpenNet, the Department’s Sensitive But  Unclassified computer network. \nChallenges regarding contract oversight also persist in  programs and posts operating in contingency and critical  environments. For example, a report on the Bureau of Near  Eastern Affairs (NEA) showed that NEA could improve  the nomination and selection of personnel to oversee  contracts in Iraq. Although the bureau had determined the  appropriate certification level needed to oversee contracts  in Iraq, it had not established the level of technical  expertise needed for contracting officer’s representatives  and government technical monitors assigned. In addition,  OIG discovered during this audit that NEA continued to  nominate contracting officers and monitors who were not  appropriately certified and did not demonstrate technical  expertise in the contract subject matter. \n\nIn another report, OIG found that short-term contracts  awarded on a sole-source basis as “bridge contracts” were  frequently used in Afghanistan and Iraq over multiple  years to non competitively extend contract services beyond  the expiration of an original contract. The Department’s  practice of using a short-term contract awarded on a  sole-source basis to the incumbent contractor over several  years limits the Department’s ability to realize potential  cost savings by maximizing full and open competition.  For example, in one instance the contract was recompeted  and resulted in saving the Department  $\\S6.8$   million. The  lack of full and open competition is also contrary to the  Competition in Contracting Act of 1984, which requires  contracting officers to promote and provide for full and  open competition. \nSimilarly, OIG found that the Department  non competitively continued Operations and Maintenance  Support Services (OMSS) and Baghdad Life Support  Services (BLiSS) contracts excessively and unjustifiably  used a Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) exception  for other than full and open competition. Specifically, the  Department executed 65 noncompetitive contract actions  that spanned approximately 3 years valued at approximately   $\\S G63$   million to continue OMSS and BLiSS services,  citing “unusual and compelling urgency” under the FAR as  justification. Instead, OIG found that poor planning, poor  coordination, and a lack of internal controls necessitated  the contract actions. OIG questioned the full value of  the OMSS and BLiSS noncompetitive contract actions,  approximately  $\\S G63$   million, because Federal law does  not permit poor planning as justification for the use of  noncompetitive contracts.

GTM has:\n\n \n   Conducted extensive recruitment to fill positions vacated during the freeze and those that were not successfully filled  prior to the freeze;\n\n \n   Effectively eliminated the Civil Service hiring backlog contributing to a net gain of 500 Civil Service hires and 13  months of uninterrupted growth in Civil Service hires;\n\n    Simplified its time to hire, reducing both its Civil Service and Foreign Service time-to-hire by approximately 20 days  and 45 days, respectively. GTM exceeded the 2020 Foreign Service hiring targets by 14 percent and had the largest  intake of Foreign Service Specialists since 2014. In 2021, intake for the Foreign Service exceeded initial targets by  4 percent and Foreign Service Specialists by 10 percent. Also of note, the Department significantly increased our  fellowships, which provide a path to entry into the Foreign Service: the number of Pickering and Rangel Fellows  increased by 50 percent (from 60 total to 90 total), while the number of Foreign Affairs IT Fellows tripled (from five   to 15); and\n\n    Piloted expedited and increased veteran hiring for select IT, GTM, and Freedom of Information Act positions as well as  expanded the talent bank of candidates with disabilities available for non-competitive hiring.

The works of art are  displayed in staff offices, reception areas, conference rooms,  the cafeteria, and related public areas. The collection consists  of original works on paper (watercolors and pastels) as well  as limited edition prints, such as lithographs, woodcuts,  intaglios, and silk-screens. These items are acquired  through purchases funded by contributions from each  participating bureau. \nRare & Special Book Collection \nIn recent years, the Ralph J. Bunche Library has identified  books that require special care or preservation. Many of  these publications have been placed in the Rare Books and  Special Collections Room, which is located adjacent to  the Reading Room. Among the treasures is a copy of the  Nuremberg Chronicles, which was printed in 1493; volumes  signed by Thomas Jefferson; and books written by Foreign  Service authors. \nCultural Heritage Collection \nThe Cultural Heritage Collection, which is managed by  the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations, Office of  Residential Design and Cultural Heritage, is responsible for  identifying and maintaining cultural objects owned by the  Department in its properties abroad. The collections are  identified based upon their historic importance, antiquity,  or intrinsic value. \nSecretary of State’s Register of  Culturally Significant Property \nThe Secretary of State’s Register of Culturally Significant  Property was established in January 2001 to recognize the  Department’s owned properties overseas that have historical,  architectural, or cultural significance. Properties in this  category include chanceries, consulates, and residences.  All of these properties are used predominantly in general  government operations and are thus classified as multi-use  heritage assets. Financial information for multi-use heritage  assets is presented in the principal statements. The register is  managed by the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations,  Office of Residential Design and Cultural Heritage. \nThis image shows a medal featuring a profile of Benjamin Franklin with the text \"Benjamin Franklin\" inscribed at the top.
