Full of curiosity, Sakichi is said to\nhave spent his early years reading a wide range of\nbooks, thinking about how he might make a contri-\nbution to society. One day, Sakichi was thinking\nabout his mother, and how every evening she toiled\nat her loom, weaving fabric late into the night. He\nwondered if there might be a way to make her work\neasier. At the time, weaving was a laborious process,\nrequiring the use of both hands and legs to control\nthe threads of warp and weft in sequence. At the\nage of 23, Sakichi invented his first loom, the Toyoda\nWooden Hand Loom, which could be operated with\nonly one hand and greatly increased efficiency. He\npatented the loom in May 1891.\n\nSeeking to more dramatically increase capacity,\nSakichi turned his attention to developing\na powered loom and invented Japan’s first, the\nToyoda Power Loom, for which he received\na patent in August 1898.\n\nSakichi continued to invent and improve looms\nfor more than two decades. This work came to\nhead with the Non-Stop Shuttle Change Toyoda\nAutomatic Loom, Type G, invented in 1924 in\ncollaboration with his son, Kiichiro.\n\nAt the time, automatic looms had to be con-\nstantly watched over by human operators so that\nthey could intervene when unpredictable anoma-\nlies, such as threads breaking, occurred. The Type\nG automatic loom used a mechanism to detect\nanomalies like running out of or breaks in the\nthread, stopping automatically in response.\n\nSakichi’s first invention:\nThe Toyoda wooden\nhand loom\n(photo provided by the\nToyota Commemorative\n\nMuseum of Industry\nand Technology)\n\nTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT,\n\nFurthermore, the Type G automatically changed\nthe loom’s shuttle when the thread was close to\nrunning out. When changing the shuttles holding\nthe weft thread, operators previously had to use\ntheir mouths to suck the end of the thread through\nthe eye of the shuttle, inhaling cotton dust, which\ncaused problems in the lungs of many workers.\nSakichi, Kiichiro, and the colleagues invented a way\nto pull the thread through using a simple manual\naction that took advantage of the thread's tension.\n\nThe drive to serve others and make their work\neasier —like Sakichi’s desire to ease the burden of his\nmother and employees—was carried on by his son\nKiichiro and remains a core value of Toyota today.\n\nThe Type G automatic loom was said to boast\nthe best performance of any loom in the world,\nimproving productivity more than twentyfold and\ndramatically increasing textile quality. The success\nof the Type G empowered Kiichiro Toyoda to take\non the challenge of establishing a Japanese\nautomotive industry, which many at the time,\nmore than 80 years ago, considered beyond the\ncapabilities of Japanese industry. This was the\nwork to which he would dedicate the rest of his life.\n\nMaking Domestic Cars and Establishing\na Japanese Auto Industry\n\nKiichiro Toyoda, the son of Sakichi, was born in\n1894. After graduating from college in 1921, he went\nto work at Toyoda Boshoku, his father’s company,\nand traveled to Europe and the United States for the\nfirst time. In the 1920s, the streets of the United\nStates were teeming with Ford Model Ts. The\nautomotive era was dawning. In Japan, the number\nof imported automobiles was gradually rising, but\ntheir use was confined to the very wealthy.\n\nModel A1 passenger car proto-\ntype completion ceremony\n\n> Our Founding Spirit » The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy > Toyota Production System (TPS)\n\nKiichiro was already determined to produce\ndomestic cars and establish a Japanese auto\nindustry. In 1926, Kiichiro was named managing\ndirector of the newly established Toyoda\nAutomatic Loom Works, Ltd. and began studying\nautomobiles in earnest. The company established\nan automotive department in September 1933\nand in 1934 officially entered the automotive\nbusiness, completing its first engine prototype.\n\nIn 1935, the first Toyoda Model A1 prototype\npassenger car was completed, and the Toyoda\nModel G1 Truck was announced. The very next\nyear, in 1936, mass production of Model AA\npassenger cars commenced. Toyota Motor Co.,\nLtd. was established in 1937, with Kiichiro be-\ncoming its president in 1941.\n\nManagement Crisis, Labor Disputes, and\nCommitment to Providing Employment\n\nIn post-war 1949 Japan, measures to curb\ninflation rapidly stabilized prices, but the resulting\nreduction in the money supply plunged industry\ninto serious funding shortages, triggering the\nso-called “Dodge Line Recession.” The prices of\niron, steel, and other materials rose, but the\nOfficially fixed price of automobiles stood\nunchanged, causing the profitability of the\nautomotive industry to decline significantly.\n\nIn December of that year, Toyota Motor Co.,\nLtd. and its labor union signed a memorandum\naimed at cooperating to overcome the crisis,\nstating that that the Company was at all costs to\navoid job cuts as a means of overcoming the\ncrisis. Kiichiro had faced employment issues at\nToyoda Automatic Loom Works during the Showa\nDepression in 1930 and was determined to never\nagain allow such a situation to arise. His entry into\nthe automotive industry had been in part a strate-\ngy to diversify and thereby avoid the recurrence of\nemployment problems, so he was, of course,\nresolved to avoid job cuts at all costs in the face\nof the 1949 business crisis.\n\nIn January 1950, negotiations with the Bank of\nJapan began on the Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.\nreconstruction plan. In April of that year, Toyota\n\nMotor Sales Co., Ltd. was established to resolve\nthe problem of delays in payments for vehicles,\na major cause of the Company’s financial troubles.\nFar from improving, however, the situation\nworsened further. As the Company's business\nresults showed no sign of improvement,\nlabor-management negotiations with the Toyota\nMotor Co., Ltd. labor union deteriorated into a\nprotracted dispute. During collective bargaining\nthat April, the Company made reconstruction\nproposals centered on job cuts that the labor\nunion could not accept, and the dispute\ncontinued for another month and a half until\na memorandum was finally signed in June.\nAccepting responsibility for the labor disputes,\nKiichiro Toyoda resigned as president of the\nCompany in May 1950. In March 1952, he agreed\nto make his much-awaited return to the position,\nbut, before he could do so, he passed away at\nthe age of 57. Nevertheless, his aspirations were\nkept alive by his colleagues, who persevered with\npurely home-grown technologies as other\nJapanese automakers were forming technology\nalliances with U.S. and European manufacturers.\nThese efforts led to the 1955 launch of the\nToyopet Crown, the first passenger car to be\ndeveloped and built entirely in Japan, a long-held\ndream of Kiichiro Toyoda.\n\nThe Spirit of Sakichi and Kiichiro Toyoda\n\nBorn into a poor family, Sakichi Toyoda was\ndriven to make others’ work easier, teaching\nhimself in order to invent automatic looms and\ngoing on to build Toyota’s foundations. Not\ncontent to simply follow the easy path set by his\nfather, Kiicinro Toyoda took on the challenge of\ndomestic car-making, which many at the time\nsaid was impossible, navigating tremendous\nsocial changes as he built the Company and the\nfoundations of Japan’s automotive industry. The\nspirit they embodied—of striving to stay ahead of\nthe times and endeavoring to be studious and\ncreative for the betterment of lives and society—\nlives on in Toyota today.

Sakichi, Kiichiro, and the colleagues invented a way  to pull the thread through using a simple manual  action that took advantage of the thread’s tension.    The drive to serve others and make their work  easier—like Sakichi’s desire to ease the burden of his  mother and employees—was carried on by his son  Kiichiro and remains a core value of Toyota today.    The Type G automatic loom was said to boast  the best performance of any loom in the world,  improving productivity more than twentyfold and  dramatically increasing textile quality. The success  of the Type  $\\textcircled{\\scriptsize{1}}$   empowered Kiichiro Toyoda to take  on the challenge of establishing a Japanese  automotive industry, which many at the time,  more than 80 years ago, considered beyond the  capabilities of Japanese industry. This was the  work to which he would dedicate the rest of his life.  \nSakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His  Mother’s Burden \nSakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota Group,  was born the son of a carpenter in the village of  Yamaguchi, now part of Kosai City, Shizuoka  Prefecture, in 1867. Full of curiosity, Sakichi is said to  have spent his early years reading a wide range of  books, thinking about how he might make a contri­ bution to society. One day, Sakichi was thinking  about his mother, and how every evening she toiled  at her loom, weaving fabric late into the night. He  wondered if there might be a way to make her work  easier. At the time, weaving was a laborious process,  requiring the use of both hands and legs to control  the threads of warp and weft in sequence. At the  age of 23, Sakichi invented his first loom, the Toyoda  Wooden Hand Loom, which could be operated with  only one hand and greatly increased efficiency. He  patented the loom in May 1891.  \n  Seeking to more dramatically increase capacity,  Sakichi turned his attention to developing  a ­ powered loom and invented Japan’s first, the  Toyoda Power Loom, for which he received  a ­ patent in August 1898.  \nMaking Domestic Cars and Establishing  a Japanese Auto Industry  \n  Sakichi continued to invent and improve looms  for more than two decades. This work came to  head with the Non-Stop Shuttle Change Toyoda  Automatic Loom, Type G, invented in 1924 in  collaboration with his son, Kiichiro.  \nKiichiro Toyoda, the son of Sakichi, was born in  1894. After graduating from college in 1921, he went  to work at Toyoda Boshoku, his father’s company,  and traveled to Europe and the United States for the  first time. In the 1920s, the streets of the United  States were teeming with Ford Model Ts. The  automotive era was dawning. In Japan, the number  of imported automobiles was gradually rising, but  their use was confined to the very wealthy.  \n  At the time, automatic looms had to be con­ stantly watched over by human operators so that  they could intervene when unpredictable anoma­ lies, such as threads breaking, occurred. The Type   $\\textcircled{\\scriptsize{1}}$   automatic loom used a mechanism to detect  anomalies like running out of or breaks in the  thread, stopping automatically in response.  \nThe image showcases three historical items related to the Toyota company:\n\n1. On the left is \"Sakichi's first invention: The Toyoda wooden hand loom,\" an early invention by Sakichi Toyoda, provided by the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology.\n\n2. In the center is the \"Type G automatic loom,\" which represents a more advanced weaving machine, showcasing the evolution of loom technology.\n\n3. On the right is a photograph from the \"Model A1 passenger car prototype completion ceremony,\" depicting an early automobile prototype developed by Toyota, along with a group of people observing the vehicle during the ceremony.\n  Kiichiro was already determined to produce  domestic cars and establish a Japanese auto  industry. In 1926, Kiichiro was named managing  director of the newly established Toyoda  Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. and began studying  automobiles in earnest. The company established  an automotive department in September 1933  and in 1934 officially entered the automotive  business, completing its first engine prototype.    In 1935, the first Toyoda Model A1 prototype  passenger car was completed, and the Toyoda  Model G1 Truck was announced. The very next  year, in 1936, mass production of Model AA  passenger cars commenced. Toyota Motor Co.,  Ltd. was established in 1937, with Kiichiro be­ coming its president in 1941.  \nManagement Crisis, Labor Disputes, and  Commitment to Providing Employment  \nIn post-war 1949 Japan, measures to curb  inflation rapidly stabilized prices, but the resulting  reduction in the money supply plunged industry  into serious funding shortages, triggering the  so-called “Dodge Line Recession.” The prices of  iron, steel, and other materials rose, but the  officially fixed price of automobiles stood  unchanged, causing the profitability of the  automotive industry to decline significantly.  \n  In December of that year, Toyota Motor Co.,  Ltd. and its labor union signed a memorandum  aimed at cooperating to overcome the crisis,  stating that that the Company was at all costs to  avoid job cuts as a means of overcoming the  crisis. Kiichiro had faced employment issues at  Toyoda Automatic Loom Works during the Showa  Depression in 1930 and was determined to never  again allow such a situation to arise. His entry into  the automotive industry had been in part a strate­ gy to diversify and thereby avoid the recurrence of  employment problems, so he was, of course,  resolved to avoid job cuts at all costs in the face  of the 1949 business crisis. \n  In January 1950, negotiations with the Bank of  Japan began on the Toyota Motor Co., Ltd.  reconstruction plan. In April of that year, Toyota  Motor Sales Co., Ltd. was established to resolve  the problem of delays in payments for vehicles,  a major cause of the Company’s financial troubles.  Far from improving, however, the situation  worsened further. As the Company’s business  results showed no sign of improvement,  labor-management negotiations with the Toyota  Motor Co., Ltd. labor union deteriorated into a  protracted dispute. During collective bargaining  that April, the Company made reconstruction  proposals centered on job cuts that the labor  union could not accept, and the dispute  continued for another month and a half until  a memorandum was finally signed in June.    Accepting responsibility for the labor disputes,  Kiichiro Toyoda resigned as president of the  Company in May 1950. In March 1952, he agreed  to make his much-awaited return to the position,  but, before he could do so, he passed away at  the age of 57. Nevertheless, his aspirations were  kept alive by his colleagues, who persevered with  purely home-grown technologies as other  Japanese automakers were forming technology  alliances with U.S. and European manufacturers.  These efforts led to the 1955 launch of the  Toyopet Crown, the first passenger car to be  developed and built entirely in Japan, a long-held  dream of Kiichiro Toyoda.  \n\nThe Spirit of Sakichi and Kiichiro Toyoda \nBorn into a poor family, Sakichi Toyoda was  driven to make others’ work easier, teaching  himself in order to invent automatic looms and  going on to build Toyota’s foundations. Not  content to simply follow the easy path set by his  father, Kiicihro Toyoda took on the challenge of  domestic car-making, which many at the time  said was impossible, navigating tremendous  social changes as he built the Company and the  foundations of Japan’s automotive industry. The  spirit they embodied—of striving to stay ahead of  the times and endeavoring to be studious and  creative for the betterment of lives and society— lives on in Toyota today. It is the core of what  makes us Toyota. "}

To emphasize the importance of the program\nand to share his own thoughts about TPS, President\nToyoda joined the kick-off session.\n\n| 1. Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His\nMother’s Burdens\n\nThis training program was created for Toyota's manage-\nment leaders who don’t work at manufacturing front\nlines to gain a deeper understanding of TPS in order to\nhelp the Company accelerate its efforts to bring back the\nessence of what makes it Toyota as it looks to completely\nredesign Toyota for the future.\n\nToyoda\n| was a little concerned to hear today’s participants’\nstatement of determination to “change Toyota any\nway possible by utilizing what's learned and obtained\nthrough this program.”\n\nThere are two key concepts deeply rooted in\nToyota since its foundation, or even before then.\nDoes anyone know what they are?\n\n7 TOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT\n\nParticipant A\n\n| think they are “Just-in-Time” and “automation with\na human touch,” or “Jidoka.”\n\nToyoda\n\nThat's it! That's what | wanted to hear! (everyone laughs)\nThat's why | volunteered to be the lecturer today to\nhelp kick off the TPS training program. Hopefully,\n\n| can help narrow the gap between my understanding\nof Jidoka and Just-in-Time and yours.\n\nFirst of all, let’s talk about Jidoka. It'll be easier to\nexplain the concept by first looking at the automatic\nloom invented by Sakichi Toyoda. Thinking about his\nmother, and how she toiled to weave fabrics every\nevening and late into the night, the young Sakichi\nwondered if there might be a way to ease her burden.\n\nWhen Sakichi developed his first automated loom, both\nhands were used to control the threads of warp and weft.\nHis invention allowed his mother to operate a loom using\nonly one hand. It also helped improve quality, increasing\noverall efficiency and dramatically improving productivity.\n\nOften at Toyota, TPS is considered the process of\nmaking things efficient, and people talk about it as if\nchanging work processes is TPS’s purpose. But,\n\n| think the purpose should always be to make\nsomeone's work easier.\n\n| 2. Improving Productivity was not the\nMain Purpose\n\nThe Type G automatic loom is the machine that helped\ndrive a redesign of Toyota’s business. Automatic looms\nback then were always monitored by one operator,\nbased on a mindset of “one person, one machine.”\nEach person was the “guard” of their machine.\n\nThis was because operators were unable to\n\npredict abnormalities.\n\nWith this automatic loom, Toyota was able to secure the\n\ncapital required to shift its business model from an\n\nautomatic loom manufacturer to a car manufacturer. This\n\nwas because a world-leading automatic loom company\n\nin the United Kingdom asked Toyota to sell its automatic\n\nloom technology.\n\nThe most common abnormalities that occurred when\nweaving fabric with automatic looms were when\nthread ran out or broke. The Type G was able to\ndetect such abnormalities at a time when there were\nno sensors.\n\nCorporate Data\n\n> Our Founding Spirit » The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy > Toyota Production System (TPS)\n\nTy ‘What is the Toyota Production Systern?\noyotalimes ea Akio Toyoda’s View\n\nWhen the thread ran out, it automatically changed\nto another wooden shuttle with a new thread.\n\nThe shuttle needs to have the thread end out on\nthe surface. Before this machine was invented,\nworkers had to suck it out themselves. The problem\nwas that there was a lot of cotton dust in the air in\ntextile factories, which could damage workers’ lungs\nwhen they inhaled deeply. Sakichi invented a new\nfeature that automatically brought out the thread end.\nThis invention was the result of Sakichi simply\nexploring a desire to do something for his team\nmembers on the manufacturing front lines who were\nsuffering damage in their lungs.\n\nThus, Sakichi determined what the abnormalities\nwere and then came up with system to prevent or\nstop them. As a result, productivity improved—not\nthe other way around. He did not do all this just to\nimprove productivity.\n\n| 3. How President Toyoda Sees Jidoka\n(Automation with a Human Touch)\n\nIn my view, Jidoka is about being centered on\npeople. It’s about putting yourself in the shoes of\nsomeone working there. You can’t just issue orders\nto improve efficiency or reduce resources from the\nsafety of your position far from the front lines.\nToyota also has this idea about adjusting the work\nper person to match the full output of one unit of\nmanpower (pursuing ichi-nin-ku in Japanese).\n\nThis concept of ichi-nin-ku means the amount of work\nthat one worker can or should accomplish in a day.\n\nWe all only have 24 hours in a day. This applies equally\nto everyone. And employees spend a lot of that time\ndevoted to work for a company. Knowing this,\nsupervisors must make the work being done by team\nmembers as meaningful as possible. That is what\nToyota’s manufacturing front lines have been pursuing.\n\nThe focus is creating more free time for workers by\n\neliminating waste in work processes to reduce overtime.\n\nPursuing ichi-nin-ku means valuing each person's time.\n| 4. How President Toyoda Sees\nJust-in-Time\n\nA phrase that is commonly associated with the concept\nof Just-in-Time is “provide what is needed, when\n\nneeded, in the amount needed.” The key to understand-\ning Just-in-Time is the idea of “lead time,” the amount of\n\ntime required for products or services to be delivered\nafter they are ordered.\n\nToyoda\nWhat comes to mind when you think about\nJust-in-Time?\n\nTaking a “what is needed when needed” approach,\nto respond quickly to customer needs, there would\nneed to be a lot of inventory, right? One finished\nvehicle consists of about 30,000 parts. So, it would\nfollow that for a production line to flexibly produce\norders quickly, a tremendous amount of inventory\nwould need to on hand, right?\n\nParticipant B\n\nBut if we know and can meet what customers want...\nToyoda\n\nWho do you mean by “customers”?\n\nParticipant B\n\nEach downstream process... or our final end users.\nToyoda\n\nBut we sell around 10 million new vehicles annually,\nand that means we have the same number of\ncustomers. How can we understand what is needed\nby each specific customer? We can't, so instead, we\nhave to have a lean operation in place to detect\nabnormalities right away and halt the pipeline so that\nwe can make improvements quickly. And that’s why\nwe need Just-in-Time.\n\nIn this way, | think the key concept that makes\nJust-in-Time easier to understand is “lead time.”\n\nAt Toyota, a common term for the next process in\n\na workflow, whether it be in manufacturing or in an office,\nis “downstream process.” Those in the downstream are\nconsidered a “customer.” President Toyoda was trying to\nconvince the participants to think of “Just-in-Time” in the\ncontext of the bigger picture, to consider not only the\nimmediate downstream, but how things relate to the\ncompany as a whole to deliver Toyota’s vehicles to the\nend customers “just-in-time.”\n\n| 5. Achieving the Lead Time of\na Sushi Restaurant?\n\nTake, for example, sushi. When you go to an authen-\ntic sushi restaurant, are the finished orders just\nwaiting in front of the chef? | don’t think so. Each\npiece is made to order. You can’t prepare every\nspecification in advance for 10 million customers.\n\nIt’s important to understand what we can’t do. The\nkey, then, is trying to shorten lead time.\n", "vlm_text": "Toyota Production System (TPS) \nThe image shows a person in a Toyota work uniform standing with arms open, next to some text. The text includes \"Toyota Times,\" \"What is the Toyota Production System?\" and \"Akio Toyoda's View.\" There's a vintage car in the background.\nIn May 2020, at Toyota’s financial results briefing,  President Akio Toyoda reflected on the efforts the  Company had made over the previous few years, saying: \n“Over the past few years, we came to feverishly engage  in both a fight to bring back what makes us Toyota  and the complete redesign of Toyota for the future.” \nRevisiting messages President Toyoda gave starting from  a few years ago, two of the things he repeatedly has said  that makes us Toyota are the Toyota Production System,  or TPS, and cost reduction. \n  Last year, at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan,  a new training program was started to nurture a select  group of “TPS leaders” from various divisions across the  Company. To emphasize the importance of the program  and to share his own thoughts about TPS, President  Toyoda joined the kick-off session. \n  1. \u0007 Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His  Mother’s Burdens \nThis training program was created for Toyota’s manage­ ment leaders who don’t work at manufacturing front  lines to gain a deeper understanding of TPS in order to  help the Company accelerate its efforts to bring back the  essence of what makes it Toyota as it looks to completely  redesign Toyota for the future. \nToyoda  \nI was a little concerned to hear today’s participants’  statement of determination to “change Toyota any  way possible by utilizing what’s learned and obtained  through this program.”  \nToyota since its foundation, or even before then.  Does anyone know what they are? \nParticipant A \nI think they are “Just-in-Time” and “automation with  a human touch,” or  “Jidoka.” \nToyoda  \nThat’s it! That’s what I wanted to hear! (everyone laughs) That’s why I volunteered to be the lecturer today to  help kick off the TPS training program. Hopefully,  I can help narrow the gap between my understanding  of  Jidoka  and Just-in-Time and yours.   First of all, let’s talk about  Jidoka.  It’ll be easier to  explain the concept by first looking at the automatic  loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda. Thinking about his  mother, and how she toiled to weave fabrics every  evening and late into the night, the young Sakichi  wondered if there might be a way to ease her burden.  \nWhen Sakichi developed his first automated loom, both  hands were used to control the threads of warp and weft.  His invention allowed his mother to operate a loom using  only one hand. It also helped improve quality, increasing  overall efficiency and dramatically improving productivity. \nOften at Toyota, TPS is considered the process of  making things efficient, and people talk about it as if  changing work processes is TPS’s purpose. But,  I think the purpose should always be to make  someone’s work easier. \n  2. \u0007 Improving Productivity was not the  Main Purpose \nThe Type G automatic loom is the machine that helped  drive a redesign of Toyota’s business. Automatic looms  back then were always monitored by one operator,  based on a mindset of “one person, one machine.”  Each person was the “guard” of their machine. This was because operators were unable to  predict abnormalities. \nWith this automatic loom, Toyota was able to secure the  capital required to shift its business model from an  automatic loom manufacturer to a car manufacturer. This  was because a world-leading automatic loom company  in the United Kingdom asked Toyota to sell its automatic  loom technology. \nThe most common abnormalities that occurred when  weaving fabric with automatic looms were when  thread ran out or broke. The Type G was able to  detect such abnormalities at a time when there were  no sensors.  \n  When the thread ran out, it automatically changed  to another wooden shuttle with a new thread.    The shuttle needs to have the thread end out on  the surface. Before this machine was invented,  workers had to suck it out themselves. The problem  was that there was a lot of cotton dust in the air in  textile factories, which could damage workers’ lungs  when they inhaled deeply. Sakichi invented a new  feature that automatically brought out the thread end.  This invention was the result of Sakichi simply  exploring a desire to do something for his team  members on the manufacturing front lines who were  suffering damage in their lungs. \n  Thus, Sakichi determined what the abnormalities  were and then came up with system to prevent or  stop them. As a result, productivity improved—not  the other way around. He did not do all this just to  improve productivity. \n  3. \u0007 How President Toyoda Sees  Jidoka (Automation with a Human Touch) \nIn my view,  Jidoka  is about being centered on  people. It’s about putting yourself in the shoes of  someone working there. You can’t just issue orders  to improve efficiency or reduce resources from the  safety of your position far from the front lines.  Toyota also has this idea about adjusting the work  per person to match the full output of one unit of  manpower (pursuing  ichi-nin-ku  in Japanese). \nThis concept of  ichi-nin-ku  means the amount of work  that one worker can or should accomplish in a day.  \nWe all only have 24 hours in a day. This applies equally  to everyone. And employees spend a lot of that time  devoted to work for a company. Knowing this,  supervisors must make the work being done by team  members as meaningful as possible. That is what  Toyota’s manufacturing front lines have been pursuing. \nThe focus is creating more free time for workers by  eliminating waste in work processes to reduce overtime.  Pursuing  ichi-nin-ku  means valuing each person’s time.  \n  4. \u0007 How President Toyoda Sees  Just-in-Time \nA phrase that is commonly associated with the concept  of Just-in-Time is “provide what is needed, when  needed, in the amount needed.” The key to understand­ ing Just-in-Time is the idea of “lead time,” the amount of  time required for products or services to be delivered  after they are ordered. \n\nToyoda  \nWhat comes to mind when you think about  Just-in-Time? \n  Taking a “what is needed when needed” approach,  to respond quickly to customer needs, there would  need to be a lot of inventory, right? One finished  vehicle consists of about 30,000 parts. So, it would  follow that for a production line to flexibly produce  orders quickly, a tremendous amount of inventory  would need to on hand, right? \nParticipant B \nBut if we know and can meet what customers want... Toyoda  \nWho do you mean by “customers”? \nParticipant B \nEach downstream process... or our final end users. Toyoda  \nBut we sell around 10 million new vehicles annually,  and that means we have the same number of  customers. How can we understand what is needed  by each specific customer? We can’t, so instead, we  have to have a lean operation in place to detect  abnormalities right away and halt the pipeline so that  we can make improvements quickly. And that’s why  we need Just-in-Time. \n  In this way, I think the key concept that makes  Just-in-Time easier to understand is “lead time.” \nAt Toyota, a common term for the next process in  a workflow, whether it be in manufacturing or in an office,  is “downstream process.” Those in the downstream are  considered a “customer.” President Toyoda was trying to  convince the participants to think of “Just-in-Time” in the  context of the bigger picture, to consider not only the  immediate downstream, but how things relate to the  company as a whole to deliver Toyota’s vehicles to the  end customers “just-in-time.” \n  5. \u0007 Achieving the Lead Time of \n a Sushi Restaurant? \nTake, for example, sushi. When you go to an authen­ tic sushi restaurant, are the finished orders just  waiting in front of the chef? I don’t think so. Each  piece is made to order. You can’t prepare every  specification in advance for 10 million customers. It’s important to understand what we can’t do. The  key, then, is trying to shorten lead time. "}

Now, Lexus is embarking on a new chapter. \n\nKoji Sato, President, Lexus International & Chief  Branding Officer  LEXUS ELECTRIFIED \nThis is the name of our electrification efforts here  at Lexus. \nExtracting the full potential of the vehicle through  electrification technology—that is what electrification  means to Lexus. \nWe will deliver a unique electrified Lexus that combines  linear motor acceleration/deceleration, brake feeling, and  exhilarating handling to further pursue the joy of driving. \nIn particular, we believe that the battery EV will  become the future symbol of Lexus as a model that  most clearly expresses the evolution of the automobile  brought about by electrification. \nThe latest of these models is the Lexus RZ. \nThe process of strengthening the fundamentals and  pursuing the Lexus Driving Signature will not change  even if it is a battery EV. \nThe endless pursuit of the Lexus Driving Signature  will move to the next stage through development of  the new sports battery EV. \nWith bold proportions and the low ride height  essential to a sports car, it will showcase the unique  driving performance of a Lexus and become a model  that symbolizes the future of the brand. \nAcceleration time will be in the low 2-second range  with a cruising range over 700 km, and, with the  possible use of solid-state batteries in mind, we will  aim to create a truly high-performance battery EV. \n\nThrough battery EVs, we will develop Lexus into a  brand that offers a variety of experiences harnessing  performance developments that only a carmaker like  Lexus could achieve and by honing the craft of  making ever more personal products. \nAkio \nLexus will develop a next-generation battery EV sports  car that inherits the unique flavor, or secret sauce, of  performance cultivated via the development of the LFA. \nThe image shows a sleek, futuristic-looking car, likely a concept or high-performance vehicle, photographed in a well-lit studio setting. The car has a shiny silver exterior with a modern design, featuring sharp lines and aerodynamic elements. It appears to have low ground clearance and sports car features. Surrounding the car in the background are other vehicles, possibly part of a car show or display. The photo is credited to Noriaki Mitsuhashi from N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY.\nWe will extend the flavor refined this way to other  models as we evolve Lexus into a brand centered on  battery EVs. \nWe can position batteries and electric motors to  bring more freedom to battery EVs. This freedom will  allow us to be more attuned to our customers, such  as by meeting the various needs of different regions,  the various lifestyles of our customers, and, when it  comes to commercial vehicles, everything from  long-distance transport to last-mile delivery. \n  An EV for everyone \nSimon Humphries, Design Senior General Manager The world is becoming ever more diverse. People are  increasingly confident in making their own choices to  lead free and enjoyable lifestyles. \nAt Toyota we believe that truly good products create  new experiences for the customer, enhancing their  chosen lifestyle directions. From that point of view,  each electric vehicle should be unique and special,  not only those on dedicated platforms but also those  related to existing models. \n\nWhether that means building on Toyota’s off-road  heritage to create new and exciting recreational  experiences or finding new ways to combine versatility  with dynamic driving. \nCommercial-use models such as the e-palette will  change the face of daily life in the city. But we will  also challenge smaller size model segments for new  mobility solutions. \nCompact ultra-versatility will open up new and  exciting possibilities for both work use and for  youngsters. And, we will take new approaches for  the smallest segments, such as “Made-for-sharing,”  where different variations cater to different  business scenes. \nAnd, last, but certainly not least, car fans like Akio  Toyoda will certainly not be disappointed. \nThe EV era is an opportunity and a chance for more  variety and more fun! \nAn EV for you, an EV for me, and an EV for everyone. \nMany years of accumulated experience  gives Toyota a competitive edge \nAkio \n“An EV for everyone.” So, what did you think about  Toyota’s battery EVs? \nThe future that we showed you today is by no means  far away. Most of the Toyota battery EVs that we  introduced here are models that will be coming out in  the next few years. "}

That is what I would like  you to understand. \nToyota vehicles are used all over the world to fill various  needs, not just for one particular market or one  specific need. \n  \u0007 Thoughts on preserving jobs \n— — Your suppliers are closely watching this  announcement, since some of them could face major  impacts. What are your thoughts on employment  within the industry? \nSince the end of last year, in his other role as chairman  of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Associations  (JAMA), Akio has pointed out that the rapid shift to BEVs  would lead to risking automotive jobs. \nThe question was about whether he has changed his  stance on the employment issue as he announces this  enhancement of Toyota’s BEV strategy. Akio responded  to this question, expressing his passion for suppliers  and, by extension, the automotive industry. \nAkio \nFirst of all, it is the market and customers who decide  which carbon-neutral options to choose. This is the  premise here. \nThe numbers related to carbon neutrality that we  have heard so far are goals for 2040 or 2050. \nWe don’t want to be a company that sets an appeal­ ing target but doesn’t bother trying to achieve it  when the announcement is done. What we are  announcing today is a bit more in the near term.  \nMany of the cars that you are looking at right now will  be launched on the market very soon. \nLooking at the run up to 2030, what we present  today will be a good tool to start discussions and  take action with various stakeholders while leaving  room to imagine more what the next 8 years will be like. \nBy presenting a guideline in the product planning  area, we will be able to examine the potential impact  on our suppliers or our production plants. \nAs the chairman of JAMA, I have warned that the  jobs of 1 million of the 5.5 million people employed in  the automotive industry would be lost if new car sales  in Japan become  $100\\%$   BEVs. At that time, various  companies came out with some vague target  numbers and not any specific figures or road maps  to achieve them. \nBut recently we have seen more concrete plans for  the near-term future from different OEMs. Now, at  Toyota, we’re also coming up with very concrete  plans including for models to be launched. We’ll have  a renewed discussion based on this. \nThe automotive industry accounts for  $75\\%$   of the  components procured from suppliers and there are  tier one, tier two and tier three suppliers supporting  the industry. Even if we emphasize the importance of  keeping many options available, that change  becomes a critical issue for suppliers who have until  now produced only engine-related parts. \nWe shouldn’t just say that it changed because the  market chose it. I would like to make the automotive  industry such that the people and companies who  have been doing a certain business for a long time,  no matter what kind of work they do or the size of  the company, will not be disappointed about their  lives and we will continue to show respect for their  meaningful work. \nThe future is not determined by the goals presented  by leaders, but by purposeful passion and action.  Toward the goal for carbon neutrality in 2050, the  view of the future in 2050 will change depending on  how we act in the next few years, five years, and ten  years, and we want to make the change happen. \nThe future will not suddenly emerge from the present;  rather, the future will be created by the accumulation  of present moments as they become the past.

In terms of cruising range,\nhigh energy density and high-level performance\nare also necessary. On the other hand, over\nemphasis on a fast charging speed may increase\nthe danger of overheating or even fire and thus\ndecrease battery safety.\n\nThis concept has remained unchanged since\nbatteries were installed in the first-generation\nPrius, and it applied to all the batteries in all of our\nelectrified vehicles.\n\nAlthough Toyota is committed to balancing the\nfive factors, too much emphasis on one could be\ndetrimental to the others. That’s why we believe\nthat the integrated development of batteries and\nvehicles is essential.\n\nHow batteries are used depends on how the\nvehicles in which they are installed are used. For\nexample, the environments in which vehicles are\noperated differ according to each vehicle’s mode\nof use, for example, if it is being used as a taxi or\nfor commuting, as well as geographic location,\nand these factors will affect such conditions as\ncharging frequency and battery temperature.\nAccordingly, we carry out mock driving tests that\nassume a diverse range of vehicle usage in order\nto obtain data on actual usage environments and\nprovide feedback to inform the evaluation and\ndesign of batteries.\n\nTo determine the balancing point of the five\nfactors discussed above, it is necessary to obtain\ndriving data that includes driving conditions and\nusage environments, find out what the conditions\nwould be like if batteries were used instead, and\nrepeatedly verify what is happening inside the\nbatteries. Such steady and earnest efforts for both\nbatteries and vehicles are the secret behind\nToyota's advantages.\n\nIntegration with Vehicles —\nThe Strengths of Toyota's Battery (>)\n\nDevelopment Strategy\n\nToyota’s Efforts for Batteries That Enable\nPeace of Mind\n\nHere, we introduce three examples of the effort\nrequired to produce batteries that can be used\nsafely, using lithium-ion batteries as the focus of\nour explanation.\n\nThe first example is about our pursuit of safety.\nIt is known that each battery cell shows signs of\nlocalized abnormal heat generation during spirited\ndriving or other driving that places a large load on\nthe battery. By analyzing the phenomena occur-\nring inside the battery and conducting a vast\nnumber of model experiments, we have been able\nto clarify the effect of driving style on the battery,\nas well as the mechanism of this effect. Based on\nthe results, we have been able to detect signs of\nabnormal local heating of cells through multiple\nmonitoring of voltage, current, and temperature of\nindividual cells, blocks of cells, and the entire\nbattery pack. The battery is then controlled to\nprevent abnormal heat generation. We adhere to\nour concept of ensuring safety, security, and\nreliability right down to the local areas within each\nbattery when it comes to BEV systems.\n\nThe second example is our commitment to long\nservice life. We have applied the technologies that\nwe have cultivated through the development of\nbatteries for HEVs to PHEVs, and the batteries in\nthe C-HR BEV have a much higher capacity\nretention rate after 10 years than the batteries\nhitherto used in our PHEVs. Furthermore, for the\nToyota bZ4x, which is scheduled to be launched\nin mid-2022, we have set a target of 90 percent\nendurance performance,* which is one of the\nhighest in the world, and we are currently finalizing\nour development efforts to achieve it.\n\n* This represents a target value for a model in the development process\nand does not indicate the performance of vehicles to be released.

In particular, we took on  the challenge of developing a bipolar structure in the  course of creating a nickel-metal hydride battery to  be installed in the Aqua, which underwent a full-scale  redesign completed in July 2021, and have become  the first in the world to commercialize a battery of this  kind as an onboard battery for driving. Compared to  the batteries used in the previous generation of  the Aqua, the output density has been doubled,  giving the car a powerful acceleration sensation.  We are currently engaged in development aimed at  creating more-advanced lithium-ion batteries by the  second half of the 2020s.  \nToyota’s Efforts for Batteries That Enable  Peace of Mind \nStriking a Balance among Five Factors \nBlazing a Path toward the Future of  Electrified Vehicles through the Integrated  Development of Batteries and Vehicles \nTo develop batteries that our customers can use  with peace of mind, we focus on producing  batteries that stand out for their “safety,” have  “long service life,” boast “high-level quality,” and  are “good yet affordable” as well as capable of  “outstanding performance.”  \nHere, we introduce three examples of the effort  required to produce batteries that can be used  safely, using lithium-ion batteries as the focus of  our explanation.  \nToyota’s Plans for a Full Lineup of Batteries \nWhile promoting a full lineup of electrified vehicles,  we have also been developing and manufacturing  a full lineup of batteries. These development  efforts are organized by type of electrified vehicle.  For HEVs, our focus is on power output, or in  other words, instantaneous power, while, when it  comes to PHEVs and BEVs, our focus is on  capacity or what can be called “endurance.” \n  The first example is about our pursuit of safety.  It is known that each battery cell shows signs of  localized abnormal heat generation during spirited  driving or other driving that places a large load on  the battery. By analyzing the phenomena occur­ ring inside the battery and conducting a vast  number of model experiments, we have been able  to clarify the effect of driving style on the battery,  as well as the mechanism of this effect. Based on  the results, we have been able to detect signs of  abnormal local heating of cells through multiple  monitoring of voltage, current, and temperature of  individual cells, blocks of cells, and the entire  battery pack. The battery is then controlled to  prevent abnormal heat generation. We adhere to  our concept of ensuring safety, security, and  reliability right down to the local areas within each  battery when it comes to BEV systems. \n  For example, a longer service life affects a  vehicle’s residual value. In terms of cruising range,  high energy density and high-level performance  are also necessary. On the other hand, over  emphasis on a fast charging speed may increase  the danger of overheating or even fire and thus  decrease battery safety.  \n  This concept has remained unchanged since  batteries were installed in the first-generation  Prius, and it applied to all the batteries in all of our  electrified vehicles. \nThe image illustrates the concept of a Bipolar Nickel-metal Hydride Battery, highlighting its use in the \"new Aqua,\" where it is employed as a vehicle drive battery. The key points include:\n\n1. **Bipolar Battery Structure**:\n   - Depicts a comparison between conventional battery structures and the new bipolar structure.\n   - Shows components like the anode, cathode, separator, current collector, and case.\n   - Emphasizes that the new structure doubles power density compared to conventional batteries.\n\n2. **Aim of Innovation**:\n   - Focuses on providing more powerful acceleration by improving battery structure and increasing power density.\n\n3. **Carbon Neutrality**:\n   - Discusses the importance of reducing CO₂ emissions across the product life cycle, from materials procurement to disposal.\n\n4. **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)**:\n   - Outlines the process from battery recycling and reuse, parts manufacturing, vehicle production, to disposal.\n   - The diagram includes elements of renewable energy generation and thermal power generation, emphasizing environmental considerations.\n\nThis image is related to advancements in vehicle battery technology and sustainability practices in the automotive industry.\n  Although Toyota is committed to balancing the  five factors, too much emphasis on one could be  detrimental to the others. That’s why we believe  that the integrated development of batteries and  vehicles is essential.  \n  How batteries are used depends on how the  vehicles in which they are installed are used. For  example, the environments in which vehicles are  operated differ according to each vehicle’s mode  of use, for example, if it is being used as a taxi or  for commuting, as well as geographic location,  and these factors will affect such conditions as  charging frequency and battery temperature.  Accordingly, we carry out mock driving tests that  \n  The second example is our commitment to long  service life. We have applied the technologies that  we have cultivated through the development of  batteries for HEVs to PHEVs, and the batteries in  the C-HR BEV have a much higher capacity  retention rate after 10 years than the batteries  hitherto used in our PHEVs. Furthermore, for the  Toyota bZ4X, which is scheduled to be launched  in mid-2022, we have set a target of 90 percent  endurance performance,\\* which is one of the  highest in the world, and we are currently finalizing  our development efforts to achieve it. \nto obtain data on actual usage environments and  provide feedback to inform the evaluation and  design of batteries.  \n  To determine the balancing point of the five  factors discussed above, it is necessary to obtain  driving data that includes driving conditions and  usage environments, find out what the conditions  would be like if batteries were used instead, and  repeatedly verify what is happening inside the  batteries. Such steady and earnest efforts for both  batteries and vehicles are the secret behind  Toyota’s advantages. \n\\* \u0007 This represents a target value for a model in the development process  and does not indicate the performance of vehicles to be released. In  addition, the figure applies only to a vehicle that has operated for 10  years or been driven 150,000 miles (240,000 kilometers).   \n  The third example has to do with our efforts to  achieve high-level quality. If metallic foreign matter  enters a battery during the manufacturing process  and causes a direct electrical connection between  the anode and cathode, the possibility of product  failure increases. To address this issue, we con­ firm the shape, composition, size, and possible  effect on endurance of every piece of foreign  matter that could enter during the manufacturing  process, and we clarify how that item may affect  the battery. Based on this analysis, we are  extremely attentive to the size and shape of  foreign matter, and we are managing processes in  a way that is aimed at preventing the generation  or entry of relevant foreign matter.

This truck boasts  considerably improved performance, including  more powerful acceleration and flexible driving  response. Furthermore, having attained  a ­ maximum loaded weight of 80,000 pounds  (approximately 36 tons) and cruising range of 300  miles (more than 480 kilometers), the truck is  designed to accommodate a range of commercial  truck needs. We will conduct the verification  \nDeveloping FCEVs to Realize \n an Ideal Vehicle  \n  For example, when gasoline vehicles are fed  gasoline mixed with a certain amount of “e-Fuel,”  the volume of their   $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$   emissions declines to  a level on par with emissions from HEVs. The mix  of “e-Fuel” in gasoline will similarly curb the volume  of  $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$   emissions from HEVs to a level on par with  PHEVs. Even PHEVs can benefit from the use of  “e-Fuel,” which will help reduce their  $\\mathrm{CO_{2}}$    emissions to be close to emissions from BEVs.  \nIn the field of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), we  released the completely redesigned Mirai in  December 2020. Premised on the use of an FCEV  system, the development of the second genera­ tion Mirai was promoted to deliver a futuristic  premium car that will be genuinely appreciated  and sought after by our customers. Specifically,  we strove to deliver a vehicle that can win drivers’  \nThe image illustrates a \"Battery Procurement and Collaboration Structure\" centered around Toyota.

The starting point is trying to not\ntransport at all. But, as that can often not be\ndone, if something needs to be transported from\npoint A to point B, we revise facility layouts to\nshorten the distance between the two locations\nwhile reducing the bulk of cargo and number of\nitems per load. We then develop an automated\nconveyance system covering only the remaining\ndistance and carrying lightest possible loads.\n\n> Making Ever-better Cars > Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality » Software and Connected Initiatives\n\n» Commercial Sector Initiatives » Woven City\n\nIn Woven City, a similar concept is utilized, in\nwhich above ground and underground roads are\ndeveloped separately, with the latter used only by\nfully automated logistics vehicles for the purpose\nof goods distribution.\n\nThe second technology is automated inspection\nusing Al.

Such mechanical dolls, designed  to carry cups of tea to guests and collect empty  cups, perform combinations of simple fundamental  movements  (karakuri)  and can be considered  a precursor to robots. The Japanese term  karakuri  generally refers to non-powered mechanical  automata operating through a combination of  gears and shafts. They can therefore be deemed  the ultimate carbon-neutral devices.  \n  At Toyota’s Honsha Plant, we maintain a pro­ duction line called the TPS basic line. This facility  was built upon our predecessors’ wisdom as well  as our ingenuity. In fact, going back to the con­ cept of  karakuri,  we have created an automated  line that does not use sensors or control devices.  \n  The use of  karakuri  is intended to nurture  human sensibilities and inform our development of  equipment. For example, because at each stage a  karakuri  mechanism must work properly for the  next action to occur, such mechanisms make it  easy to detect problems without relying on sensors. \n\n  At Toyota, we replace pallets containing produc­ tion parts via non-powered operation, using this  mechanism in combination with automated  conveyance carts to achieve an unmanned process. \nCollaboratively Employing the Latest  Technologies and the TPS \nToyota’s efforts to create a “green factory” are  being promoted by collaboratively employing the  latest technologies and the TPS. \n  The first technology is automated conveyance.  At Toyota, transporting, itself, is considered  wasteful. The starting point is trying to not  transport at all. But, as that can often not be  done, if something needs to be transported from  point A to point B, we revise facility layouts to  shorten the distance between the two locations  while reducing the bulk of cargo and number of  items per load. We then develop an automated  conveyance system covering only the remaining  distance and carrying lightest possible loads.  \n  In Woven City, a similar concept is utilized, in  which above ground and underground roads are  developed separately, with the latter used only by  fully automated logistics vehicles for the purpose  of goods distribution.   \n  The second technology is automated inspection  using AI. There are many examples in the world of  automated inspection of defective products using  machine learning to reduce the need for human  labor. However, our goal is to use the vast amount  of data we are collecting from this process to  make essential improvements that will prevent  defects from occurring in the first place.  \n  The third technology has to do with digital  transformation   $({\\mathsf{D}}\\mathsf{X})$   and IoT. With regard to IoT,  a technology that connects nearly everything to  the internet, we have experienced setbacks  despite our best efforts to become a forerunner in  the rush toward IoT. Although we raised the  equipment utilization rate on production lines to   $98\\%$   by pursuing continuous improvement and  applying the TPS, there remains the problem of  how to address the last  $2\\%$  . It is a real problem  that can only be solved by the power of people.  \nToyota believes that people should not be turned  into machine-keepers. To get that final  $2\\%$  , we aim  to simplify equipment and create equipment that  does not break down. \n  By combining this unique, human-centered,  Toyota thinking with DX and IoT, we hope to  create the next generation of advanced  \n\n  In 2019, we launched a vehicle production line  that collaboratively employs the latest technologies  and the TPS in Mexico (see the diagram below).  \nTaking Full Advantage of the Power of  Monozukuri  (manufacturing) Unparalleled  by Global Peers  \nIn the face of a forthcoming wave of new chal­ lenges, such as calls for carbon neutrality and the  need for DX, we at Toyota stand with our fellow  manufacturers around the world. Working hand in  hand with them, we will take on these challenges  and become the best automaker in town in each  region in which we operate.  \nThe image depicts a diagram of Toyota's Honsha Plant highlighting aspects of the Toyota Production System (TPS) Basic Line. It includes sections focusing on:\n\n1. **Karakuri Systems**: These are mechanical devices that perform simple tasks without the need for electricity, such as parts conveyance, fitting mechanisms, failproof systems, and ergonomic support.\n   - Examples include vacuum replacement mechanisms, flowing rack conveyance carts, and ergonomic support systems (Raku raku sheet).\n\n2. **Innovative Equipment**: This refers to advanced tools and systems like the main conveyor (SS turn), SS subline conveyor, SS parts installation assistance devices, and engine and rear suspension installers.\n\n3. **Illustrative Example**: A highlighted example shows an oil seal press-fitting machine operating on karakuri principles.

At its peak, the\nplant had 2,000 employees, and a total of 7,000\nindividuals worked there over its history, producing\nsuch vehicles as the Toyota Century, Toyota’s\nlagship chauffeur car infused with Toyota crafts-\nmanship, and the JPN Taxi, a car that requires many\ntimes the durability of an ordinary passenger car.\nThe concept for Woven City can be traced\nback to the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.\nPresident Akio Toyoda sought to create jobs for\nthe region’s people, who were hit hardest by the\ndisaster, by creating a third base of operations in\nthe Tohoku region. Guided by his strong leader-\nship, Toyota established Toyota Motor East\nJapan, Inc. in 2012.

Woven City will  demonstrate cutting edge  technologies in such areas  as automated driving,  \nBuilding on Our History of Manufacturing \nWoven City will be constructed on the site of  Toyota Motor East Japan’s former Higashi-Fuji  Plant, which was a pillar of production for Toyota  for 53 years, starting in 1967. At its peak, the  plant had 2,000 employees, and a total of 7,000  individuals worked there over its history, producing  such vehicles as the Toyota Century, Toyota’s  flagship chauffeur car infused with Toyota crafts­ manship, and the JPN Taxi, a car that requires many  times the durability of an ordinary passenger car.   The concept for Woven City can be traced  back to the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011.  President Akio Toyoda sought to create jobs for  the region’s people, who were hit hardest by the  disaster, by creating a third base of operations in  the Tohoku region. Guided by his strong leader­ ship, Toyota established Toyota Motor East  Japan, Inc. in 2012. However, this also led to the  \nmobility as a service (MaaS), personal  mobility, robotics, smart homes, and  artificial intelligence (AI) in a real living  environment. By rapidly implementing  development and demonstration cycles of  technologies and services in this human-\n centered city, we aim to continuously  produce new value and business models by  utilizing the mobility of  “information,”  “goods,” and “people” to support daily life. \ndifficult decision to close the Higashi-Fuji Plant.  Looking for a way to carry on the Higashi-Fuji  Plant’s legacy of manufacturing to help create  future mobility for the next 50 years, he arrived at  the idea of transforming the site into a connected  city as a large-scale demonstration experiment. \nOur Unwavering Principles: \n “Human-centered,” “A Living Laboratory,”  and the “Ever-evolving City” \nUnder the Woven City project, we are imagining  the life of each resident as we seek to design  a city that will most make people happy. Working  with researchers, engineers, and scientists, we will  demonstrate future technologies in both the virtual  and the real world and will roll out the resulting  technologies and products developed around the  globe. Woven City will be a constantly improving,  ever-evolving city rooted in Toyota’s  kaizen   approach—thinking that there is always a better  way. We will work with partners who share our  aspiration in this quest to realize better living and  mobility for all. \nThe image depicts a futuristic urban development at dusk or night, with modern buildings and illuminated streets.

Aimed at realizing safe mobility, it will be  a sort of test course for the integrated three-part  development of automated driving at the levels of  people, vehicles, and the traffic environment. In its  early stages, Woven City will house around 360  residents, comprising mainly seniors, families, and  inventors. In the future, the city will have more  than 2,000 residents, including Toyota employees,  demonstrating technologies in mobility and a wide  range of other fields, from logistics to energy, food  and agriculture as it grows into an environment  conducive to the timely generation of new  inventions that address social issues.   \nCarrying on a Commitment to \n “Human-centered” Operations \nThe name “Woven City” comes from Toyota’s origins  in automatic looms. Toyota Group founder Sakichi  Toyoda was driven to invent an automatic loom out  of a desire to make his mother’s work easier. We  have guarded and nurtured this spirit of service to  others ever since. Woven City will take up this  commitment from the Higashi-Fuji Plant, growing and  evolving as the foundation for a new era at Toyota. "}

The Board of Directors also resolves to delegate  the determination of the amount of remuneration  for each Member of the Board of Directors to the  Executive Compensation Meeting. The Executive  Compensation Meeting reviews the executive  remuneration system on which it will consult with  the Board of Directors and determines the amount  of remuneration for each Member of the Board of  Directors, taking into account factors such as  corporate performance as well as individual job  responsibilities and performance, in accordance  with the policy for determining remuneration for  and other payments to each member of the Board  of Directors established by the Board of Directors.

Fixed remuneration is set, taking  into account each member’s job responsibilities and  the remuneration standard of his/her home country.  Performance-based remuneration is set based on  consolidated operating income, the volatility of the  share price of Toyota, and individual performance,  taking into account each member’s job responsibili­ ties and the remuneration standard of his/her home  country. The concept of each item is the same as for  directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding  Outside Directors). Differences in tax rates in Japan  and their home countries may be considered and  compensated for. \nToyota sets the total amount of remuneration  (Annual Total Remuneration) received by each  director in a year based on consolidated operating  income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota  and individual performance evaluation. The balance  after deducting monthly remuneration, which is fixed  remuneration, from Annual Total Remuneration  constitutes performance-linked remuneration. \n  Toyota sets an appropriate executive compen­ sation level for the Annual Total Remuneration  based on position and duties by referencing a  benchmark group of companies located in Japan. \n  Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board  Members is determined by the Audit &  Supervisory Board within the scope determined  by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. To  decide the compensation for the fiscal year under  review, the Executive Compensation Meeting was  held in May 2020, March 2021, and April 2021.  Also, preparatory meetings attended solely by  Outside Directors were held five times in August,  September, and October 2020 and February and  March 2021 to hold discussions in preparation for  the Executive Compensation Meeting. The  compensation for the Members of the Board of  Directors was decided with the agreement of all  members of the Executive Compensation Meeting. \nTable 1 Table 2 \nMethod of Setting the Annual Total Remuneration Annual Total Remuneration is set according to a  formula based on the benchmark results of executive  compensation. Annual Total Remuneration for each  position is set based on consolidated operating  income and the volatility of the share price of  Toyota, and then adjusted based on individual  performance evaluation. Individual performance  evaluation is conducted in view of the efforts made  according to the concept of the “Toyoda  \nShare-based Compensation System \nThe Board of Directors decides the share-based  compensation, using the maximum share-based  compensation (4.0 billion yen per year) set in the  115th Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting  held on June 13, 2019.

Strategies and policies in each area in  light of risks and opportunities are set mainly by  the Environmental Product Design Assessment  Committee, the Production Environment  Committee and the Resource Recycling  Committee and all relevant organizations work  together to carry out initiatives. \n  Environmental secretariats have been estab­ lished in six regions (North America, Europe,  China, Asia, South America and South Africa) in  order to undertake globally integrated environ­ mental initiatives while taking local conditions into  consideration. The secretariats share a commit­ ment to the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050  and promote cooperation.  \n  Moreover, the Sustainability Meeting, which is  chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO),  deliberates in a timely fashion the long-term  enhancement of competitiveness and responses  to risks considering internal and external changes  on issues such as environment, social and  governance, and reports the results to the Board  of Directors. \n  Progress regarding measures to reduce  $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$   in  the areas of product development and production  are regularly reported as key management  indicators at meetings attended by all of those  at the chief officer or company president level  and above. \nStrategy \nToyota Environmental Challenge 2050 \nToyota formulated the Toyota Environmental  Challenge 2050 in October 2015 and the 2030  Milestone in 2018, ensuring that it would continue  to tackle challenges from a long-term perspective  that looks to the world 20 and 30 years ahead  and addresses such global environmental issues  as climate change, water shortages, resource  depletion, and loss of biodiversity. \nRisks and Opportunities Relating to \n Climate Change \nToyota strives to identify the various risks and  opportunities that will arise from environmental  issues and takes action accordingly while continu­ ously confirming the validity of strategies such as  the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and  working to enhance its competitiveness.   Among these risks and opportunities, climate  change requires measures in various areas,  including the adoption of new technology and  response to tighter government regulations. As  climate change progresses, higher temperatures,  rising sea levels, and an increase in the severity of  natural disasters such as typhoons and flooding  are expected.  \n  These changes may have various impacts on  Toyota’s business fields and may also pose risks  to Toyota’s business. However, it is our under­ standing that if we can respond appropriately, this  will lead to enhanced competitiveness and the  acquisition of new business opportunities.   In accordance with this understanding, we have  organized the risks relating to climate change and  identified particularly significant risks in line with  risk management processes based on the degree  of impact and stakeholders’ interest. \nScenario Analysis Assuming Risks \n and Opportunities \nClimate change and the policies of various  countries may expose the automobile industry  and the entire mobility society to substantial  changes.
