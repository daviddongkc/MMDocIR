Our inventions have helped power the growth in\nsmartphones, which have connected billions of people. We are a leader in 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and\n5G (fifth generation) wireless technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products,\nincluding our Snapdragon® family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property,\nincluding patents and other rights.\n\nThe foundational technologies we invent help power the modern mobile experience, impacting how the world connects,\ncomputes and communicates. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing program, enabling wide ecosystem\naccess to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our wireless integrated circuit platforms (also\nknown as integrated circuit products, chips or chipsets) and other products. We collaborate across the ecosystem, including\nmanufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers, governments and\nindustry standards organizations, to enable a global environment to drive continued progress and growth.\n\nWe have a long history of driving innovation. We have played and continue to play a leading role in developing system\nlevel inventions that serve as the foundation for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as the\nCDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of\ntechnologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary\ndigital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless\nnetwork.\n\nWe own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products\nthat implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. Companies in the mobile industry generally recognize\nthat any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/\nor OFDMA-based technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize\nnumerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property\nrelated to these technologies.

Our 52-week fiscal years consist of four equal fiscal quarters of 13  weeks each, and our 53-week fiscal years consist of three 13-week fiscal quarters and one 14-week fiscal quarter. The  financial results for our 53-week fiscal years and our 14-week fiscal quarters will not be exactly comparable to our 52-week  fiscal years and our 13-week fiscal quarters. The fiscal years ended September 26, 2021, September 27, 2020 and  September 29, 2019 included 52 weeks.  \nOverview \nWe are a global leader in the development and commercialization of foundational technologies for the wireless industry.  Our technologies and products are used in mobile devices and other wireless products, and are sold across industries and  applications beyond mobile handsets, including automotive and the internet of things (IoT) (which includes the industries and  applications of consumer, industrial and edge networking), among others. Our inventions have helped power the growth in  smartphones, which have connected billions of people. We are a leader in 3G (third generation), 4G (fourth generation) and  5G (fifth generation) wireless technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products,  including our Snapdragon  $^\\mathrm{\\textregistered}$   family of highly-integrated, system-based solutions, and licensing of our intellectual property,  including patents and other rights. \nThe foundational technologies we invent help power the modern mobile experience, impacting how the world connects,  computes and communicates. We share these inventions broadly through our licensing program, enabling wide ecosystem  access to technologies at the core of mobile innovation, and through the sale of our wireless integrated circuit platforms (also  known as integrated circuit products, chips or chipsets) and other products. We collaborate across the ecosystem, including  manufacturers, operators, developers, system integrators, cloud providers, tool vendors, service providers, governments and  industry standards organizations, to enable a global environment to drive continued progress and growth. \nWe have a long history of driving innovation. We have played and continue to play a leading role in developing system  level inventions that serve as the foundation for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless technologies. This includes technologies such as the  CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) families of  technologies, with the latter encompassing LTE (Long Term Evolution) and 5G NR (New Radio), which are the primary  digital technologies currently used to transmit voice or data over radio waves using a public or private cellular wireless  network. \n We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications and trade secrets, applicable to products  that implement any version of CDMA and/or OFDMA technologies. Companies in the mobile industry generally recognize  that any company seeking to develop, manufacture and/or sell devices or infrastructure equipment that use CDMA-based and/ or OFDMA-based technologies will require a license or other rights to use our patents. We also develop and commercialize  numerous other key technologies used in mobile and other wireless devices, and we own substantial intellectual property  related to these technologies. Some of these inventions are contributed to and commercialized as industry standards, such as  for certain video and audio codecs, Wi-Fi, GPS (Global Positioning System) and Bluetooth ® . We have also developed other  technologies that are used by wireless devices that are not related to industry standards, such as operating systems, user  interfaces, graphics and camera processing functionality, RF (radio frequency), RFFE (radio frequency front-end) and  antenna designs, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning techniques and application processor architectures. Our  patents cover a wide range of technologies across the entire wireless system (including wireless devices and network  infrastructure equipment), not just the portion of such patented technologies incorporated into chipsets.

Since the first commercial 5G networks were launched in\nApril of 2019, 180 operators in more than 70 countries have commercially launched 5G, with more than 280 additional\noperators investing to deploy the technology as of September 30, 2021 (GSA, October 2021). Most 5G devices include\nmultimode support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi technologies, enabling service continuity where 5G has yet to be deployed. They\nalso allow mobile operators to utilize existing 3G and/or 4G network infrastructure, enabling them to roll out 5G services\nover time, while also helping to maximize previous generation equipment investments. As of September 30, 2021, there were\napproximately 7.0 billion 3G/4G/SG connections globally, representing 85% of total mobile connections (GSMA\nIntelligence, November 2021). By 2025, global 3G/4G/5G connections are projected to reach 8.4 billion, with approximately\n86% of these connections in emerging regions and China (GSMA Intelligence, November 2021).\n\nConsumer Demand in Smartphones. From October 2020 through September 2021, approximately 1.4 billion\nsmartphones are estimated to have shipped globally, representing a year-over-year increase of approximately 8%, primarily\ndriven by a recovery from the impacts of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which negatively impacted consumer\ndemand for smartphones (IDC, Mobile Phone Tracker, 2021Q2). Smartphone shipments in calendar 2022 are expected to\nincrease by approximately 3% year-over-year (IDC, Mobile Phone Tracker, 2021Q2), reflecting modest growth in emerging\nregions. We estimate that 5G smartphone shipments will be between 500 and 550 million in calendar 2021, more than\ndoubling compared to the prior year.

OFDMA-based technologies are characterized by their access method allowing several users to share the\nsame frequency band and time by allocating different subcarriers to individual users. Most of the OFDMA-based\ntechnologies deployed prior to 2020 are classified as 4G technology. 5G heavily leverages OFDMA-based technologies.\n3GPP developed the 4G system through the specification of the radio component (LTE) and the core network component\n(Enhanced Packet Core or EPC). Similarly, 3GPP has developed the 5G system through the specification of the radio\ncomponent (NR) and the core network component (5G Core or 5GC). Unlike 4G that has fixed Orthogonal Frequency\nDivision Multiplexing (OFDM) parameterization, 5G has multiple OFDM parameterizations to address a wide range of\nspectrum and use cases. We continue to play a significant role in the further development of LTE-based technologies, such as\nNarrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced Machine Type Communications (eMTC) and Enhanced TV broadcast (EnTV).\n\nLTE is incorporated in 3GPP specifications beginning with Release 8 and uses OFDMA in the downlink and single\ncarrier FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) in the uplink. LTE has two modes, FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)\nand TDD (Time Division Duplex) to support paired and unpaired spectrum, respectively, and continues to evolve as 3GPP\ndefines new specifications. The principal benefit of LTE is its ability to leverage a wide range of spectrum (bandwidths of up\nto 20 MHz or more through aggregation). LTE is designed to seamlessly interwork with 3G technologies through multimode\ndevices.\n\nLTE Advanced brings many more enhancements, including carrier aggregation, advanced multi-antenna techniques and\noptimizations for small cells. Apart from improving the performance of existing networks, there are also enhancements under\nthe umbrella of LTE Advanced Pro, including LTE Direct for proximity-based device-to-device discovery, improved LTE\nbroadcast, optimizations of narrowband communications designed for loT (known as eMTC and NB-IoT) and the ability to\nuse LTE Advanced in unlicensed spectrum (LTE Unlicensed), as well as in shared spectrum bands in various regions, such as\nthe Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in the United States. There are multiple options for deploying LTE Unlicensed\nfor different deployment scenarios.\n\n« LAA (Licensed Assisted Access), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 13, aggregates unlicensed and licensed\nspectrum in the downlink and is being deployed globally by mobile operators. LAA is a key technology for many\noperators with limited licensed spectrum to deliver Gigabit LTE speeds.\n\n*  eLAA (enhanced LAA), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 14, is an evolution of LAA. eLAA enables aggregation\nof unlicensed and licensed spectrum in the uplink.\n\nBeginning with Release 14, 3GPP specifications provide enhancements specifically for C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to-\neverything), which includes both direct communication (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-\npedestrian) in dedicated spectrum that is independent of a cellular network and cellular communications with networks in\ntraditional mobile broadband licensed spectrum.\n\nAs of September 30, 2021, there were approximately 4.7 billion global LTE connections worldwide, representing\napproximately 58% of total cellular connections, up from 56% as of September 30, 2020 (GSMA Intelligence, November\n2021).\n\nThe wireless industry is actively developing and commercializing 5G technologies. Commercial 5G network\ndeployments and device launches began in calendar 2019, and we expect that additional deployments and device launches\nwill occur as more operators and geographic regions launch 5G services. Many of our inventions at the core of 3G and 4G\nserve as foundational technologies for 5G. 5G is designed to transform the role of wireless technologies and already\nincorporates advancements on 3G/4G features available today, including device-to-device capabilities and the use of all\ndifferent types of spectrum (including licensed, unlicensed and shared spectrum). We continue to play a significant role in\ndriving advancements in 5G, including contributing to 3GPP standardization activities that are defining the continued\nevolution of SG NR and 5GC standards.\n\nThe first global set of 5G standards is incorporated in 3GPP specifications starting from Release 15, which was initially\ncompleted in March 2018. Release 15 enables different architecture deployment choices of 5G networks while sharing the\nsame radio access technology. This is due to 5G’s ability to target diverse services with very different technical requirements\n(from enhanced mobile broadband to massive IoT to mission critical services), its utilization of diverse types of spectrum\n(from the low bands to millimeter wave (nmWave) bands) and its ability to support diverse types of deployment scenarios.\nPredominant technological components of 5G include the ability to address ultra-reliable, low-latency communication, new\nchannel coding schemes to efficiently support large data blocks, MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) to increase coverage\nand network capacity and mobile mmWave to increase the data rate offered to users. 5G uses OFDMA in the downlink and\neither OFDMA or single carrier FDMA in the uplink depending on the use case. Like 3G and 4G, 5G supports carrier\naggregation across spectrum bands, across FDD and TDD and across licensed and unlicensed spectrum (starting with Release\n16), and 5G also supports dual connectivity across 4G and 5G. A key benefit of 5G is its ability to take advantage of very\nwide channel bandwidth (i.e., up to 100 MHz per component carrier for sub-6 and up to 400MHz per component carrier for\nmmWave), compared to LTE’s 20 MHz maximum bandwidth, which requires carrier aggregation to combine spectrum\n\n10\n", "vlm_text": "As of September 30, 2021, there were approximately 1.7 billion CDMA-based connections worldwide, representing  approximately   $21\\%$   of total cellular connections, down from  $23\\%$   as of September 30, 2020 as consumers migrate to  OFDMA-based technologies (GSMA Intelligence, November 2021). \nOFDMA-based.

We continue to play a significant role in the further development of LTE-based technologies, such as  Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), enhanced Machine Type Communications (eMTC) and Enhanced TV broadcast (EnTV). \nLTE is incorporated in 3GPP specifications beginning with Release 8 and uses OFDMA in the downlink and single  carrier FDMA (Frequency Division Multiple Access) in the uplink. LTE has two modes, FDD (Frequency Division Duplex)  and TDD (Time Division Duplex) to support paired and unpaired spectrum, respectively, and continues to evolve as 3GPP  defines new specifications. The principal benefit of LTE is its ability to leverage a wide range of spectrum (bandwidths of up  to   $20\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$   or more through aggregation). LTE is designed to seamlessly interwork with 3G technologies through multimode  devices.  \nLTE Advanced brings many more enhancements, including carrier aggregation, advanced multi-antenna techniques and  optimizations for small cells. Apart from improving the performance of existing networks, there are also enhancements under  the umbrella of LTE Advanced Pro, including LTE Direct for proximity-based device-to-device discovery, improved LTE  broadcast, optimizations of narrowband communications designed for IoT (known as eMTC and NB-IoT) and the ability to  use LTE Advanced in unlicensed spectrum (LTE Unlicensed), as well as in shared spectrum bands in various regions, such as  the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) in the United States. There are multiple options for deploying LTE Unlicensed  for different deployment scenarios. \n• LAA (Licensed Assisted Access), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 13, aggregates unlicensed and licensed  spectrum in the downlink and is being deployed globally by mobile operators. LAA is a key technology for many  operators with limited licensed spectrum to deliver Gigabit LTE speeds.  • eLAA (enhanced LAA), introduced as part of 3GPP Release 14, is an evolution of LAA. eLAA enables aggregation  of unlicensed and licensed spectrum in the uplink. \nBeginning with Release 14, 3GPP specifications provide enhancements specifically for C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to- everything), which includes both direct communication (vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to- pedestrian) in dedicated spectrum that is independent of a cellular network and cellular communications with networks in  traditional mobile broadband licensed spectrum. \nAs of September 30, 2021, there were approximately 4.7 billion global LTE connections worldwide, representing  approximately   $58\\%$   of total cellular connections, up from  $56\\%$   as of September 30, 2020 (GSMA Intelligence, November  2021). \nThe wireless industry is actively developing and commercializing 5G technologies. Commercial 5G network  deployments and device launches began in calendar 2019, and we expect that additional deployments and device launches  will occur as more operators and geographic regions launch 5G services. Many of our inventions at the core of 3G and 4G  serve as foundational technologies for 5G. 5G is designed to transform the role of wireless technologies and already  incorporates advancements on 3G/4G features available today, including device-to-device capabilities and the use of all  different types of spectrum (including licensed, unlicensed and shared spectrum). We continue to play a significant role in  driving advancements in 5G, including contributing to 3GPP standardization activities that are defining the continued  evolution of 5G NR and 5GC standards.  \nThe first global set of 5G standards is incorporated in 3GPP specifications starting from Release 15, which was initially  completed in March 2018. Release 15 enables different architecture deployment choices of 5G networks while sharing the  same radio access technology. This is due to 5G’s ability to target diverse services with very different technical requirements \n\n (from enhanced mobile broadband to massive IoT to mission critical services), its utilization of diverse types of spectrum \n\n (from the low bands to millimeter wave (mmWave) bands) and its ability to support diverse types of deployment scenarios.  Predominant technological components of 5G include the ability to address ultra-reliable, low-latency communication, new  channel coding schemes to efficiently support large data blocks, MIMO (multiple input, multiple output) to increase coverage  and network capacity and mobile mmWave to increase the data rate offered to users. 5G uses OFDMA in the downlink and  either OFDMA or single carrier FDMA in the uplink depending on the use case. Like 3G and 4G, 5G supports carrier  aggregation across spectrum bands, across FDD and TDD and across licensed and unlicensed spectrum (starting with Release  16), and 5G also supports dual connectivity across 4G and 5G. A key benefit of 5G is its ability to take advantage of very  wide channel bandwidth (i.e., up to   $100\\,\\mathrm{\\dot{MHz}}$   per component carrier for sub-6 and up to  $400\\mathrm{{\\dot{MHz}}}$   per component carrier for  mmWave), compared to LTE’s  $20\\:\\mathrm{MHz}$   maximum bandwidth, which requires carrier aggregation to combine spectrum  "}

As with previous cellular generations, 5G is designed to support seamless compatibility with 3G/4G\ntechnologies through multimode devices.\n\n5G is the first generation of cellular wireless communication systems to use transmissions at mmWave bands, which\ncreates certain challenges including coverage limitations and blockages, heightened costs and power constraints. In order to\naddress these challenges, we have been a leader in designing RFFE modules and RF filter products which, when paired with\nour modems, provide a comprehensive 5G modem-to-antenna solution. Our RFFE modules and RF filter products use\nadaptive beamforming (which spatially concentrates radio energy in a given beam direction to extend the range) and enable\nthe efficient tracking and switching of beams in accordance with varying radio conditions. mmWave deployments rely on\nsmall cells (low-powered cellular base stations typically used for increased system capacity and which may have already\nincorporated Gigabit LTE) to allow for faster, more reliable mobile service with transmissions at mmWave bands. 3GPP has\nso far defined six mmWave bands.

Release 16 also supports different spectrum types by expanding 5G into unlicensed spectrum\nwith 5G NR Unlicensed (NR-U). Release 16 NR-U focused on sub-7GHz operation (commonly referred to as sub-6, sub-7 or\nFrequency Range 1), specifically SGHz and 6GHz bands, and Release 17 will expand NR-U to support higher bands such as\n60GHz. High-precision positioning was another focus area in Release 16. Accurate device positioning is a key enabler for\nmany applications, such as public safety and indoor navigation. Release 16 added new capabilities for 5G positioning,\nsupporting techniques such as multi-cell roundtrip time, angle of arrival/departure and time difference of arrival. Release 16\naddressed the growing needs of low-power, wide-area IoT use cases by allowing in-band deployments of NB-IoT and eMTC\nin 5G carriers, as well as supporting these low-complexity loT technologies with the new 5G core network.

Our Snapdragon application processor functions  include CPU, security, graphics, display, audio, video, camera and AI. Our CPUs are designed based on the ARM  architecture and are designed to deliver high levels of compute performance with optimized power consumption. Our  Qualcomm ®  Hexagon™ processors are designed to support a variety of signal processing applications, including AI, audio  and sensor processing. Our Qualcomm ®  Adreno™ graphics processing units are designed to deliver high quality graphics  performance for visually rich 3D gaming and user interfaces. In addition to the highly integrated core SoC, we also design  and supply supporting components, including the RF transceiver, PM (power management), audio, codecs, speaker amps and  additional wireless connectivity integrated circuits. These supporting components, in addition to our cellular modems and  application processors comprising our core SoC, are also sold as individual components. The combination of the Snapdragon  SoC, system software and supporting components provide an overall platform with optimized performance and efficiency,  enabling manufacturers to design and deliver powerful, slim and power-efficient devices ready for integration with the  complex cellular networks worldwide.   \nOur portfolio of RF products includes Qualcomm ®  RFFE components that are designed to simplify the RF design for 5G  front-end, LTE multimode and multiband mobile devices, including sub-6 GHz and mmWave devices, to reduce power  consumption and to improve radio performance. We provide comprehensive RFFE product offerings with system level  performance from the modem and transceiver to the antenna that include complex 4G/5G transmit and receive modules,  power tracking, tuning systems, multimode-multiband power amplification, low noise amplifiers and mmWave antenna  solutions, in addition to discrete filtering products, for devices and applications across the mobile handsets, automotive and  IoT industries. We have also integrated our Snapdragon platform with our RFFE components to create our Snapdragon 5G  modem-RF products, the world’s first commercial modem-to-antenna 5G solution designed to maximize data speeds and  performance, support superior call connectivity and coverage and extend battery life. \nOur wireless connectivity products also consist of integrated circuits and system software for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and  frequency modulation (FM), as well as technologies that support location data and services, including GPS, GLONASS,  Galileo, NavIC and BeiDou. Our wireless connectivity products provide additional connectivity for mobile devices, tablets,  laptops, XR headsets, voice and music devices, wearable devices, automotive telematics, digital cockpit, utility meters,  logistic trackers and industrial sensors, in addition to other IoT devices and applications. QCT also offers standalone Wi-Fi,  Bluetooth, fingerprint sensor, applications processor and Ethernet products utilized within these devices and systems. Our  networking products include Wi-Fi, Ethernet and Powerline chips, network processors, wireless access points and routers,  broadband gateway equipment and software. These products help enable home and business networks to support the growing  number of connected devices, digital media and data services.  \nOther than for certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which  means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are  made. Therefore, we primarily rely on third parties to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of  our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers also are responsible for the  procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. Integrated circuits are die cut from  silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. The semiconductor package  supports the electrical contacts that connect the integrated circuit to a circuit board. Die cut from silicon wafers are the  essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We employ  both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry  suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing  model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate  third parties for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements.  The primary foundry suppliers for our various digital, analog/mixed-signal, RF and PM integrated circuits are Global  Foundries, Samsung Electronics, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), Taiwan Semiconductor  Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics.

We\nencourage you to review the “Our People” section of our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on\nour website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital goals, programs and initiatives. Nothing on our\nwebsite, including our Consolidated EEO-1 reports, our Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report or sections thereof, shall\nbe deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\n\n19\n", "vlm_text": "\nCompensation and Benefits.  We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our  employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an  employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending  accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance,  employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among many  others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting  conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience. \nTalent Development.  We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading wireless  innovator. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus  on continuous learning and development, and implemented “industry-leading” methodologies to manage performance,  provide feedback and develop talent. \nOur talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals,  build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that  support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing  opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We  also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the  individual’s development needs. \nBuilding Connections - With Each Other and our Communities.  We believe that building connections between our  employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our  engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving  opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local  arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the  world.  \nSince our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and  encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees  select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation  (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these  organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, thousands of our employees around  the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,600 charitable organizations. \n2025 Goals.  We set the following  2025 Goals  related to human capital, with a focus on diversity and inclusion: \n• Increase women in leadership by   $15\\%$   (defined as individuals at the principal and above level in technical roles, and  director and above in non-technical roles).  • Increase underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership by  $15\\%$   (for technical positions, “URM” includes Black,  Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Native American; for non-technical  positions, URM also includes Asian).  • Increase overall URM representation by  $20\\%$  . \nHuman Capital Advancements Added to our Executive Compensation.  As previously disclosed in our 2021 Proxy  Statement, and in response to stockholder feedback, our HR and Compensation Committee allocated   $10\\%$   of our executives’  fiscal 2021 bonus to be based upon human capital advancements. The HR and Compensation Committee then adopted a  framework for human capital advancements to include advancement of our 2025 diversity and inclusion goals, workforce  stability and responsiveness to COVID-19.  \nThe foregoing discussion includes information regarding Human Capital matters that we believe may be of interest to  stockholders generally.

Specifically, throughout most of calendar 2020 and into early\ncalendar 2021, the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer devices sold by our customers or licensees\nresulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit products (which are incorporated into such devices) and a decrease in\nthe royalties we earned on the licensing of our intellectual property (which is dependent upon the number of such devices\nsold that utilize our intellectual property).

Additionally, federal, state or foreign governments may in the future increase corporate tax rates, increase\nemployer payroll tax obligations and/or otherwise change tax laws to pay for stimulus and other actions that have been and\nmay in the future be taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our\nemployees working from home. We could be negatively affected in the future if, among others, a significant number of our\nemployees, or employees who perform critical functions, become ill and/or are quarantined as the result of exposure to\nCOVID-19, or if government policies restrict the ability of those employees to perform their critical functions.

Future acquisitions or other  strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to  consummate acquisitions has been harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any  transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted. \nRISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING   \nWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our  products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply  assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are  also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations. \nWe primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production  of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our  RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and  assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of  the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers,  and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at  older process technology nodes. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply our products are primarily located in  Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders.  \nThe following issues related to our third-party suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer  demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows: \n• a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources; • a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products; • an inability to procure or utilize raw materials, components or products from our suppliers due to government  prohibitions or restrictions on transactions with certain countries and/or companies, and alternative suppliers, raw  material sources or raw materials are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable  terms; • a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity for our products; • our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices; • our suppliers’ inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out, manufacturing capacity for  leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies; • the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery  schedules;  • additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production  or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier; • natural disasters, the effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts impacting our suppliers;  • health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business  responses thereto, which impact our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures;  • cyber-attacks on our suppliers’ information technology (IT) systems, including those related to their manufacturing  foundries or assembly, test or other facilities; and  • trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent  us from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such  suppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to  manufacture goods for us. \nWhile we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, there are a limited number of such suppliers, and  even fewer who are capable of operating at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older  process technology nodes. We rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the risks  identified above, and subject us to other significant risks, including poor product performance and reduced control over  delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have  established or in the future establish alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant amounts of time and levels of  support to bring such technologies to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies.  As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such  alternate suppliers. Further, the elimination or limitation of a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture components or  products for us due to trade or national security protection policies could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source  arrangements and limit or prevent us from procuring critical components or products from those suppliers. Future  consolidation of foundry suppliers could also increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce  our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions, increase  our manufacturing costs and limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate  us to incur costs to manufacture, assemble and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing  to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including  transitions to smaller geometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to  effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to  introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could  subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and  cash flows. "}

Depending on the matter, various\nremedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others: the loss of our ability to enforce one or\nmore of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages, fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease\ncertain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which\nour royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or\nrenegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are\ninvalid or unenforceable. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and\nimpose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region.

The renegotiation of license agreements\ncould result in terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing\nterms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or possibly years.\nLicensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations,\narbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private\nantitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material\nadverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our stock price could\ndecline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in\nresearch and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in\n\n31\n", "vlm_text": "If we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows  would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.

In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be  negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing  structure. \nIf we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing program could be  negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to  such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs).

Development of products in new domains of\ntechnology, such as the transition to 5G, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature\nsizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product\ndefects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also\nbe introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party\nproducts or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of\nour products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated\nwith product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically\nintegrate our products into consumer and other devices.\n\nThe use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content\ncreates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security\nvulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’\nproducts, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or\nour customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the\nmisappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary,\nconfidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we\ncontinue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities\ncontinue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and\ntechniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving.

Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant\ncosts, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing\ndown defective inventory, or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and\ndivert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security\nvulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of\nbusiness to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships\nwith customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential\nadverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant\nand equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security\nvulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into\nwhich our products are integrated, and thus for our products.\n\nIn addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims,\nparticularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into\nwhich they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses.

Development of products in new domains of  technology, such as the transition to 5G, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature  sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product  defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also  be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party  products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of  our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated  with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically  integrate our products into consumer and other devices. \nThe use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content  creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security  vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’  products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or  our customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the  misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary,  confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we  continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities  continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and  techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving.

Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant  costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing  down defective inventory, or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts.

We are also\nsusceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results\nare subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid\ntechnological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life\ncycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand\nfor end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments, underutilization of manufacturing\ncapacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to\nsuch cyclical downturns. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may\nbe adversely impacted.\n\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in\ngeographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or\nlicensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in\ndemand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees;\nthe inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our\ncustomers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key\nsuppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties;\nand/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay\nfor our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be\nadversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products.\n\nOur stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may\nhave a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and\nthroughout this Risk Factors section, as well as; volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor\ncompanies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees; and\nvariations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market\nprice of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities\nlitigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources.

We are also  susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results  are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others. \nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid  technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life  cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand  for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments, under utilization of manufacturing  capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to  such cyclical downturns. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may  be adversely impacted. \nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in  geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or  licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in  demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees;  the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our  customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key  suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties;  and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay  for our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be  adversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products. \nOur stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may  have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and  throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as; volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor  companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees; and  variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others.  In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market  price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities  litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal  matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.

Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new  Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory,  administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, including, among others, could have an adverse effect on  our business and results of operations.

Highlights from fiscal 2021 and\nother recent events included:\n\n* QCT revenues increased by 64% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in demand\nfor 5G products across handsets and RFFE, in part reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19,\nalong with higher automotive and IoT revenues.\n\n* QTL revenues increased by 26% in fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in estimated\nsales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products, in part reflecting a recovery from the negative impacts of COVID-19.\n\n* —QSI earnings before income taxes increased by $927 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher net\ngains on investments.\n\n* On March 16, 2021, we completed the acquisition of NUVIA for $1.1 billion, net of cash acquired. NUVIA has\ncertain in-process technologies and is comprised of a CPU (central processing unit) and technology design team with\nexpertise in high performance processors, SoC (system-on-chip) and power management for compute-intensive\ndevices and applications. Upon completion of development, NUVIA’s technologies are expected to be integrated\ninto certain QCT products.\n\n* On March 26, 2021, the FTC’s deadline for filing a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court to seek\nreview of the Ninth Circuit’s decision in our favor in United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) v.\nQUALCOMM Incorporated expired. The case is now over.\n\n* In October 2021, we and SSW Partners, a New York-based investment partnership, entered into a definitive\nagreement to acquire Veoneer, Inc. (Veoneer) for $37.00 per share in cash, which values the estimated total cash\nconsideration to be paid to Veoneer’s shareholders at approximately $4.5 billion. At closing, SSW Partners will\nacquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Veoneer, shortly after which it will sell Veoneer’s Arriver business to\nQualcomm and retain Veoneer’s Tier-1 automotive supplier businesses. Following the close of the Arriver business\nsale, we intend to incorporate Arriver’s computer vision, drive policy and driver assistance technologies into our\nSnapdragon automotive platform to deliver an open and competitive ADAS platform for automakers and Tier-1\nautomotive suppliers. Subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022.\n\nOur Business and Operating Segments\n\nWe develop and commercialize foundational technologies and products used in mobile devices and other wireless\nproducts. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property,\nincluding patents and other rights.\n\nWe are organized on the basis of products and services and have three reportable segments. We conduct business\nprimarily through our QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) semiconductor business and our QTL (Qualcomm\nTechnology Licensing) licensing business. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic\ninvestments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies), our cloud Al\ninference processing initiative and other technology and service initiatives.\n\nFurther information regarding our business and operating segments is provided in “Part I, Item 1. Business” of this\nAnnual Report.\n\nSeasonality. Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless\ndevices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on\nconsumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such\nas the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance\nof and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees’ sales occur. These trends\nmay or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes\nand/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.\n\n4l\n", "vlm_text": "The following section generally discusses fiscal 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal 2021  and 2020.

As a result\nof these regulations, our fiscal 2021 effective tax rate increased by approximately 1%. The retroactive impact resulting from\nthese new regulations, which was related to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 and recorded in fiscal 2021, was not significant.\n\nUnrecognized tax benefits were $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion at September 26, 2021 and September 27, 2020,\nrespectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean\nwithholding taxes previously paid as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on payments due under their licensing\nagreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed (which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision). If\nsuccessful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We are subject to income taxes in\nthe U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide,\nprimarily related to transfer pricing. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims,\ndeficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax\nprovision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As\nof September 26, 2021, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final\ndetermination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income\ntax provision and the related accruals.\n\nThe current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have proposed to increase U.S. tax rates and/or eliminate or\nreduce the FDII deduction. Substantially all of our income is taxable in the U.S., of which a significant portion qualifies for\npreferential treatment as FDIL.

The retroactive impact resulting from  these new regulations, which was related to fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 and recorded in fiscal 2021, was not significant. \nUnrecognized tax benefits were   $\\S2.1$   billion and  $\\S1.9$   billion at September 26, 2021 and September 27, 2020,  respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2021 was primarily due to expected refunds of Korean  withholding taxes previously paid as licensees in Korea continue to withhold taxes on payments due under their licensing  agreements at a rate higher than we believe is owed (which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision). If  successful, the refund will result in a corresponding reduction in U.S. foreign tax credits. We are subject to income taxes in  the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions and are currently under examination by various tax authorities worldwide,  primarily related to transfer pricing. These examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims,  deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax  provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. As  of September 26, 2021, we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for based on facts known. However, the final  determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income  tax provision and the related accruals.  \nThe current U.S. presidential administration and Congress have proposed to increase U.S. tax rates and/or eliminate or  reduce the FDII deduction. Substantially all of our income is taxable in the U.S., of which a significant portion qualifies for  preferential treatment as FDII. If such proposals are enacted into law, our provision for income taxes, results of operations  and cash flows would be adversely affected (potentially materially) beginning as early as the first quarter of fiscal 2022. \nSegment Results \nThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2021 and 2020 results of operations for each reportable  segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

The remaining debt has maturity dates in 2023 through 2050. \nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to  $\\S4.5$   billion of commercial  paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At  September 26, 2021 , we had  $\\S500$   million  of commercial paper outstanding. \nOn December 8, 2020, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility replacing our prior Amended and Restated Revolving  Credit Facility. There were no outstanding borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Facility at the time  of termination. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of  credit in an aggregate amount of up to  $\\S4.5$   billion, which expires on December 8, 2025. At  September 26, 2021 , no amounts  were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.  \n We expect to issue new debt in the future. The amount and timing of any such new debt will depend on a number of  factors, including but not limited to maturities of our existing debt, acquisitions and strategic investments, favorable and/or  acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at  September 26, 2021  is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.”  \nIncome Taxes.  At  September 26, 2021 , we estimated remaining future payments of  $\\S1.9$   billion for a one-time U.S.  repatriation tax accrued in fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next  five years. At  September 26, 2021 , other current liabilities included   $\\S196$   million for the next installment due in January  2022. Additional information regarding our income taxes is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes.” \nAcquisitions.  In October 2021, we and SSW Partners entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer for total  estimated cash consideration of approximately  $\\S4.5$   billion, substantially all of which will be funded by Qualcomm, and we  paid a  $\\S110$   million termination fee to Magna International Inc., on behalf of Veoneer. Further, we have agreed to provide a  loan facility (or guarantee amounts provided by a third party) that provides financing to Veoneer of up to  $\\S480$   million. The  acquisition is expected to close in 2022. Information related to this definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer, including  additional information related to certain contingent financing obligations, is included in this Annual Report in “Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12. Subsequent Events.” We expect to continue making strategic investments and  acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain  development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new businesses.

We grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio,\nwhich, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain\nwireless products. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the\nlicensees’ sales occur, which is based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees. Actual amounts for\nsales-based royalties have been materially consistent with such estimates, and no significant reversals of revenues have been\nrequired as a result of adjustments to prior period royalty estimates. Significant evaluation and judgment were required in\ndetermining the appropriate accounting for the settlement agreement and the global patent license agreement with Huawei,\nwhich were signed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We considered, among other items, Huawei’s commitment to perform\nunder such agreements (including Huawei’s intent and ability to pay amounts due), Huawei’s performance as of the date of\nassessment under the agreements (including timely payments made), Huawei’s then-current and projected financial condition\n(including the impact of enacted national security protection policies by the U.S. government on Huawei’s business) and\ncertain contractual protections that we obtained under these agreements. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, Huawei paid the\nfinal installment under the settlement agreement, and there were no changes to our previous judgments, estimates and initial\nevaluation related to the revenues recorded in fiscal 2020 under the settlement agreement.\n\nImpairment of Non-marketable Equity Investments. We monitor our investments for events or circumstances that could\nindicate impairment, including those that result from observable price adjustments. In fiscal 2021, we recorded impairment\nlosses on other investments (which primarily related to our non-marketable equity investments) of $33 million, a decrease of\n$372 million compared to fiscal 2020. Significant evaluation and judgments were required in determining if the negative\neffects of COVID-19 indicated that such investments were impaired, and if so, the extent of such impairment. This included,\namong other items: (i) assessing the business impacts that COVID-19 had on our investees, including taking into\nconsideration the investee’s industry and geographic location and the impact to its customers, suppliers and employees, as\napplicable, (ii) evaluating the investees’ ability to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, including any significant\ndeterioration in the investee’s financial condition and cash flows, as well as assessing liquidity and/or going concern risks and\n(iii) considering any appreciation in fair value that has not been recognized in the carrying values of such investments. Based\non this evaluation, certain of our investments were impaired and written down to their estimated fair values in fiscal 2020 (a\nsignificant portion of which related to the full impairment of our investment in OneWeb, who filed for bankruptcy in the\nsecond quarter of fiscal 2020).

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarketable Securities\n\nWe have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography\nand changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments.\n\nEquity Price Risk. At September 26, 2021, the recorded value of our marketable equity securities was $682 million. A\n10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities at September 26, 2021 would have caused a decrease in\nthe carrying amounts of these securities of $68 million. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity\nsecurities at September 27, 2020 would have caused a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $35 million.\n\nInterest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed- and floating-rate securities\nconsisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and time and demand deposits that are subject to interest rate risk.\nAt September 26, 2021 and September 27, 2020, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across the entire\nyield curve on our holdings would have resulted in a decrease of $50 million and $32 million, respectively, in the fair value\nof our holdings.\n\nOther Investments\n\nEquity Price Risk. We hold investments in non-marketable equity instruments in privately held companies that may be\nimpacted by equity price risks. Volatility in the equity markets could negatively affect our investees’ ability to raise\nadditional capital as well as our ability to realize value from our investments through initial public offerings, mergers or\nprivate sales. Consequently, we could incur impairment losses or realized losses on all or part of the values of our non-\nmarketable equity investments. At September 26, 2021, the aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity\ninvestments was included in other assets and was $1.3 billion.\n\nDebt and Interest Rate Swap Agreements\n\nInterest Rate Risk. As substantially all of our debt is comprised of unsecured fixed-rate notes, we are not subject to\nsignificant interest rate risk. At September 26, 2021, we had an aggregate principal amount of $500 million in unsecured\nfloating-rate notes due January 30, 2023. The interest rates on our floating-rate notes are based on LIBOR. At September 26,\n2021 and September 27, 2020, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR-based interest rates of 100 basis points would cause a\nnegligible increase to interest expense on an annualized basis as it relates to our floating-rate notes. At September 26, 2021,\nwe also had $500 million in commercial paper outstanding, for which our exposure to interest rate risk was negligible based\non the original maturities of approximately three months or less.\n\nFrom time to time, we manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks related to our long-term debt through the use of\ninterest rate swaps. During fiscal 2021, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional\namount of $2.6 billion to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through 2025.\nThe interest rates on our interest rate swaps are based on LIBOR. At September 26, 2021, a hypothetical decrease in interest\nrates of 100 basis points would cause an increase of $23 million to interest expense on an annualized basis resulting from the\nchanges in fair values of the interest rate swaps related to our anticipated debt issuances through 2025.\n\nForeign Exchange Risk\n\nWe manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative and\nnon-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties\nand net investment hedges. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather\nthan for speculative purposes. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of\nthe financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle\ntransactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us,\nwhich could have a negative impact on our results.\n\nForeign Currency Options. At September 26, 2021, our net liability related to foreign currency options designated as\nhedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees was negligible. At September 26, 2021 and\nSeptember 27, 2020, if our forecasted royalty revenues for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 10% and foreign\nexchange rates were to change unfavorably by 10% in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss as our hedge\npositions would continue to be fully effective.\n\nForeign Currency Forwards. At September 26, 2021, our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts\ndesignated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was $39 million.

As substantially all of our debt is comprised of unsecured fixed-rate notes, we are not subject to  significant interest rate risk. At September 26, 2021, we had an aggregate principal amount of  $\\S500$   million in unsecured  floating-rate notes due January 30, 2023. The interest rates on our floating-rate notes are based on LIBOR. At September 26,  2021 and September 27, 2020, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR-based interest rates of 100 basis points would cause a  negligible increase to interest expense on an annualized basis as it relates to our floating-rate notes. At September 26, 2021,  we also had  $\\S500$   million in commercial paper outstanding, for which our exposure to interest rate risk was negligible based  on the original maturities of approximately three months or less.  \nFrom time to time, we manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks related to our long-term debt through the use of  interest rate swaps. During fiscal 2021, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional  amount of  $\\S2.6$   billion to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on anticipated debt issuances through 2025.  The interest rates on our interest rate swaps are based on LIBOR. At September 26, 2021, a hypothetical decrease in interest  rates of 100 basis points would cause an increase of   $\\S23$   million to interest expense on an annualized basis resulting from the  changes in fair values of the interest rate swaps related to our anticipated debt issuances through 2025. \nForeign Exchange Risk   \nWe manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative and  non-derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties  and net investment hedges. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather  than for speculative purposes. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of  the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle  transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us,  which could have a negative impact on our results. \nForeign Currency Options.  At September 26, 2021, our net liability related to foreign currency options designated as  hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees was negligible. At September 26, 2021 and  September 27, 2020, if our forecasted royalty revenues for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by  $10\\%$   and foreign  exchange rates were to change unfavorably by   $10\\%$   in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss as our hedge  positions would continue to be fully effective.  \nForeign Currency Forwards.  At September 26, 2021, our net asset related to foreign currency forward contracts  designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on certain operating expenditure transactions was  $\\S39$   million. If our forecasted  operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by   $10\\%$   and foreign exchange rates were to change  unfavorably by   $10\\%$   in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a negligible loss. Based on forecasts at September 27,  2020, assuming the same hypothetical market conditions, we would not have incurred a loss. "}

The new accounting guidance also eliminated the concept of other-\nthan-temporary impairment with credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities recorded through an allowance for\ncredit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. We adopted the new accounting guidance\nin the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective transition method, except for certain available-for-sale debt\nsecurities where the prospective transition method was required, and as a result, prior period results have not been restated.\nThe impact upon adoption was not material to our consolidated financial statements. The future impact of such accounting\nguidance will largely depend on the future composition and credit quality of our investment portfolio and accounts\nreceivable, as well as future economic conditions.\n\nLeases: In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to leases that outlines a new comprehensive\nlease accounting model and requires expanded disclosures (ASC 842). Under the new accounting guidance, we are required\nto recognize right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. We adopted ASC 842 in\nthe first quarter of fiscal 2020 using the modified retrospective approach, with the cumulative effect of initial adoption\nrecorded as an adjustment to our opening consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2019. We elected to not record leases\nwith a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we applied the package of practical\nexpedients permitted under the transition guidance, which among other things, does not require reassessment of lease\nclassification upon adoption. Finance leases were not material for all periods presented. Adoption of the new accounting\nguidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Results for fiscal 2019\nhave not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with the accounting guidance in effect for those periods.\n\nRevenue Recognition: In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance related to revenue recognition (ASC\n606). We adopted ASC 606 in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method only to those\ncontracts that were not completed as of October 1, 2018. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new\nrevenue accounting guidance as an adjustment to opening retained earnings.\n\nIncome Taxes: In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that changes the accounting for the income\ntax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. We adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter\nof fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting\nguidance recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings of $2.6 billion, primarily as the result of establishing a\ndeferred tax asset on the basis difference of certain intellectual property distributed from one of our foreign subsidiaries to a\nsubsidiary in the United States in fiscal 2018.\n\nCash Equivalents.

We adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter  of fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method, with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting  guidance recognized as an adjustment to opening retained earnings of   $\\S2.6$   billion, primarily as the result of establishing a  deferred tax asset on the basis difference of certain intellectual property distributed from one of our foreign subsidiaries to a  subsidiary in the United States in fiscal 2018. \nCash Equivalents.  We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash  equivalents. Cash equivalents may be comprised of money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate  bonds and notes, certain bank time and demand deposits and government agencies’ securities. The carrying amounts  approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments. "}

This valuation also requires us to make judgments and  assumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, product pricing,  product life cycle, development plans and other broader market conditions that may impact customer demand, such as the  impact of certain c apacity constraints experienced across the semiconductor industry in fiscal 2021 and the impacts of COVID-19  in fiscal 2020.  As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases, resulting in an  increased reliance on our own forecasts of customer demand, rather than our customers’ forecasts. If we overestimate demand  for our products, the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchases from our  suppliers, including those under our multi-year capacity purchase commitments. Our assumptions of future product demand  are inherently uncertain, and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to record additional write-downs in the  future if demand forecasted for specific products is greater than actual demand. \nProperty, Plant and Equipment.  Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using  the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. Upon the retirement or disposition of property, plant and  equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed, and a gain or loss is recorded, when  appropriate. Buildings on owned land are depreciated over 30 years, and building improvements are depreciated over 15  years. Leasehold improvements and buildings on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives, not  to exceed 15 years and 30 years, respectively, or the remaining term of the related lease. Other property, plant and equipment  "}

Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized for leases with lease terms greater than 12 months\nbased on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. Operating leases are\nincluded in other assets, other current liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our lease terms may\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option. We account\nfor substantially all lease and related non-lease components together as a single lease component. Operating lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the\nnet tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Acquired intangible assets other than goodwill are\namortized over their useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite. For intangible assets purchased in a business\ncombination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets\nacquired in a nonmonetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the\nassets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets\nreceived nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured\nbased on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income\napproach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions\nthat require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires us to use assumptions to estimate\nfuture cash flows including those related to total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology\nobsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from\nthat determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models and from the future cash flows\nactually realized.\n\nImpairment of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived\nintangible assets are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods, if events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. If a qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair\nvalue of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than 50%) less\nthan its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. If goodwill is quantitatively assessed for\nimpairment and a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Other\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair\nvalues to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our\njudgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and long-lived assets\nmay be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors.\nAlthough there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including\nestimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these\nestimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion\nor all of our goodwill and/or long-lived assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering\nevents nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that\nimpairment indicators exist, and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses are impaired.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for\nimpairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or\nasset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying\namount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset\ngroup. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is\nrecognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the\nasset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their\nestimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our\nintellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other\nservices and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in\neach case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our\nperformance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the\ntime of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is\nsatisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all\nperiods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other\nrights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products.\nLicensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also\npay a fixed license fee in one or more installments.

Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the  wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including  transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain  categories of complete wireless devices, namely smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum  royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period  in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably  available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our  licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our  licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as  the licensees’ average wholesale prices of such products. We have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary  royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received  the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us,  and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due,  which requires us to independently estimate certain information.

We are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceedings. Litigation\nand investigations are inherently uncertain, and we face difficulties in evaluating or estimating likely outcomes or ranges of\npossible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigations in particular. Investigations by antitrust and trade regulation\nagencies are not conducted in a consistent manner across jurisdictions. Further, each country and agency has different sets of\nlaws, rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, as well as different legal principles, theories and potential\nremedies, and some agencies may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goals. Depending on the\njurisdiction, these investigations can involve non-transparent procedures under which we may not receive access to evidence\nrelied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theories or\nevidence considered or relied upon by the agency. Unlike in civil litigation in the United States, in foreign proceedings, we\nmay not be entitled to discovery or depositions, allowed to cross-examine witnesses or confront our accusers. As a result, we\nmay not be aware of, and may not be entitled to know, all allegations against us, or the information or documents provided to,\nor discovered or prepared by, the agency. Accordingly, we may have little or no idea what an agency’s intent is with respect\nto liability, penalties or the timing of a decision. In many cases the agencies are given significant discretion, and any available\nprecedent may have limited, if any, predictive value in their jurisdictions, much less in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we\ncannot predict the outcome of these matters. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed\nto violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary\ndamages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our\nbusiness practices.\n\nIf there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and\nregulatory proceedings, we disclose such fact, and if reasonably estimable, we provide an estimate of the possible loss or\nrange of possible loss.

Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with\nno best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we\nassess the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings and revise our estimates and update our\ndisclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to\nwhether a loss is reasonably estimable.

Further, each country and agency has different sets of  laws, rules and regulations, both substantive and procedural, as well as different legal principles, theories and potential  remedies, and some agencies may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goals. Depending on the  jurisdiction, these investigations can involve non-transparent procedures under which we may not receive access to evidence  relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theories or  evidence considered or relied upon by the agency. Unlike in civil litigation in the United States, in foreign proceedings, we  may not be entitled to discovery or depositions, allowed to cross-examine witnesses or confront our accusers. As a result, we  may not be aware of, and may not be entitled to know, all allegations against us, or the information or documents provided to,  or discovered or prepared by, the agency. Accordingly, we may have little or no idea what an agency’s intent is with respect  to liability, penalties or the timing of a decision. In many cases the agencies are given significant discretion, and any available  precedent may have limited, if any, predictive value in their jurisdictions, much less in other jurisdictions. Accordingly, we  cannot predict the outcome of these matters. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed  to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary  damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our  business practices. \nIf there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and  regulatory proceedings, we disclose such fact, and if reasonably estimable, we provide an estimate of the possible loss or  range of possible loss. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings when the loss  is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with  no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we  assess the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceedings and revise our estimates and update our  disclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to  whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Our legal costs associated with defending ourself are recorded to expense as incurred.  \nForeign Currency.  Certain foreign subsidiaries use a local currency as the functional currency. Resulting translation  gains or losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Transaction gains or losses related  "}

As a result,  $\\S1.9$   billion and  $\\S1.6$   billion was recorded as a noncurrent  income taxes receivable (recorded in other assets) at September 26, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively, and   $\\S1.9$   billion and  $\\S1.6$   billion was recorded as a noncurrent liability for uncertain tax benefits (recorded in other liabilities) at  September 26, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively.  \nAt September 26, 2021, we estimated remaining future payments of  $\\S1.9$   billion for a one-time repatriation tax accrued in  fiscal 2018, after application of certain tax credits, which is payable in installments over the next five years. At September 26,  2021,   $\\S196$   million was recorded in other current liabilities, reflecting the next installment due in January 2022. \nWe continue to assert that certain of our foreign earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. At September 26, 2021, we had  not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately  $\\S63$   million related to foreign withholding taxes on approximately  $\\mathbb{S}761$    million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiaries that we continue to consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the  United States. Should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the U.S., we would have to adjust the  income tax provision in the period we make such determination. \nWe have tax incentives in Singapore that require we meet specified employment and other criteria. Although our profit in  Singapore has declined as a result of our 2018 restructuring and such tax incentives were not significant for all periods  presented, failure to meet these incentive requirements through March 2022 could require us to refund previously realized  material tax benefits for 2017 and 2018.

In April 2017, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict\nLitigation transferred the cases that had been filed in the Southern District of California to the Northern District of California.\nOn July 11, 2017, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that we violated California and federal\nantitrust and unfair competition laws by, among other things, refusing to license standard-essential patents to our competitors,\nconditioning the supply of certain of our baseband chipsets on the purchaser first agreeing to license our entire patent\nportfolio, entering into exclusive deals with companies, including Apple Inc., and charging unreasonably high royalties that\ndo not comply with our commitments to standard setting organizations. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and\ndisgorgement and/or restitution, as well as an order that we be enjoined from further unlawful conduct. On August 11, 2017,\nwe filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. On November 10, 2017, the court denied our motion,\nexcept to the extent that certain claims seek damages under the Sherman Antitrust Act.

On September 29, 2021, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court’s class certification order, ruling that the court\nhad failed to correctly assess the propriety of applying California law to a nationwide class.

The  KFTC’s decision orders us to: (a) upon request by modem chipset companies, engage in good-faith negotiations for patent  license agreements, without offering unjustifiable conditions, and if necessary submit to a determination of terms by an  independent third party; (b) not demand that handset companies execute and perform under patent license agreements as a  precondition for purchasing modem chipsets; (c) not demand unjustifiable conditions in our license agreements with handset  companies and, upon request, renegotiate existing patent license agreements; and (d) notify modem chipset companies and  handset companies of the decision and order imposed on us and report to the KFTC new or amended agreements. According  to the KFTC’s decision, the foregoing will apply to transactions between us and the following enterprises: (1) handset  manufacturers headquartered in Korea and their affiliate companies; (2) enterprises that sell handsets in or to Korea and their  affiliate companies; (3) enterprises that supply handsets to companies referred to in (2) above and the affiliate companies of  such enterprises; (4) modem chipset manufacturers headquartered in Korea and their affiliate companies; and (5) enterprises  that supply modem chipsets to companies referred to in (1), (2) or (3) above and the affiliate companies of such enterprises.

We continue to cooperate with the KFTC as it conducts its investigation.

On October 1, 2019, we filed an appeal of the EC’s decision with the\nGeneral Court of the European Union. The court has not yet ruled on our appeal. We believe that our business practices do\nnot violate the European Union (EU) competition rules.\n\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $275 million to other expenses related to this EC fine.

The fine is accruing interest at a rate of 1.50% per annum while it is outstanding. In the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2019, we designated the liability as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, with gains\nand losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of the foreign currency translation\nadjustment. At September 26, 2021, the liability, including related foreign currency losses and accrued interest (which, to the\nextent they were not related to the net investment hedge, were recorded in investment and other income, net), was $292\nmillion and included in other current liabilities.\n\nEuropean Commission (EC) Investigation: On October 15, 2014, the EC notified us that it was conducting an\ninvestigation of us relating to Articles 101 and/or 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). On\nJanuary 24, 2018, the EC issued a decision finding that pursuant to an agreement with Apple Inc. we paid significant amounts\nto Apple on the condition that it exclusively use our baseband chipsets in its smartphones and tablets, reducing Apple’s\nincentives to source baseband chipsets from our competitors and harming competition and innovation for certain baseband\nchipsets, and imposed a fine of 997 million euros. On April 6, 2018, we filed an appeal of the EC’s decision with the General\nCourt of the European Union. From May 4, 2021 to May 6, 2021, a hearing on our appeal was held before the court.
