Specifics of Application\n\nA procedure called the “agreement on special cooperation” constitutes a specialized type of\nprocedural agreement that may be used when the cooperation of the accused or convicted person\nresults in establishing the identity of an official who has committed a crime, or informing the\nauthorities about the name of an individual who committed a grave or especially grave crime.\nSuch agreements are initiated upon the petition of the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia to the court\nrequesting a complete release of the accused from liability or punishment, or requesting judicial\nreview of the punishment.\n\nA procedural agreement on special cooperation concluded between the accused/convict and the\nChief Prosecutor of Georgia serves as a basis for this petition. While concluding such an\nagreement, the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia must take into consideration the public interest, the\ngravity of the crime committed by the accused/convict, and the degree of his or her guilt. The\nunserved part of a convict’s criminal sentence must be additionally taken into consideration.\n\nSuch an agreement may only be concluded if solving a crime directly depends on the\naforementioned cooperation, and the public interest in solving the crime outweighs holding the\nindividual liable, sentencing him or her, or having him or her serve a sentence.!3\n\nAn agreement on special cooperation must be signed by the accused/convict, the defense\nattorney, and the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia. It must clearly indicate that if the accused/ convict\nfails to cooperate with the investigation, the agreement will be declared void.\"\n\nIV.

Specifics of Application  \nA procedure called the “agreement on special cooperation” constitutes a specialized type of  procedural agreement that may be used when the cooperation of the accused or convicted person  results in establishing the identity of an official who has committed a crime, or informing the  authorities about the name of an individual who committed a grave or especially grave crime.  Such agreements are initiated upon the petition of the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia to the court  requesting a complete release of the accused from liability or punishment, or requesting judicial  review of the punishment.   \nA procedural agreement on special cooperation concluded between the accused/convict and the  Chief Prosecutor of Georgia serves as a basis for this petition. While concluding such an  agreement, the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia must take into consideration the public interest, the  gravity of the crime committed by the accused/convict, and the degree of his or her guilt. The  unserved part of a convict’s criminal sentence must be additionally taken into consideration.   \nSuch an agreement may only be concluded if solving a crime directly depends on the  aforementioned cooperation, and the public interest in solving the crime outweighs holding the  individual liable, sentencing him or her, or having him or her serve a sentence.    \nAn agreement on special cooperation must be signed by the accused/convict, the defense  attorney, and the Chief Prosecutor of Georgia. It must clearly indicate that if the accused/convict  fails to cooperate with the investigation, the agreement will be declared void.    \nIV.

Introduction  \nIndonesian law does not currently contain processes or rules for plea bargaining of charges or  sentences. The Criminal Procedure Code ( Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Acara Pidana , KUHAP), which was enacted in 1981, has been the subject of reform proposals for a number of years. A  drafting team was established in 2000, and an academic draft of a new KUHAP was published in  late 2007.  The Ministry of Law and Human Rights published a formal draft bill in 2010.  The bill  ( rancangan undang-undang , RUU) remains before the House of Representatives ( Dewan Perwakilan  Rakyat , DPR), being listed on the national legislation program for 2019 and carried over to the  2020-2024 program, along with a bill to replace the existing Criminal Code ( Kitab Undang-Undang  Hukum Pidana , KUHP).  However, it appears that both bills continue to be the subject of  discussion and revision. According to reports, in September 2019 the President of Indonesia  ordered that the passage of the RUU KUHP be postponed in order for the public to be given the  opportunity to provide input.  Furthermore, the RUU KUHAP was not included in the top 50  priority proposals to be considered by the DPR in 2020.    "}

Furthermore,  he argues for the relevant provisions to be amended so that the RUU KUHAP clearly provides  for “(1) strict time limitations that ensure increased efficiency for defendants; (2) a provision that  makes the use of torture to gather evidence inadmissible; and (3) removal of legislative barriers  to leniency in punishment.” 19    \nAnother author also takes a comparative approach to the proposed special path provisions,  examining plea bargaining concepts and procedures in the United States, Canada, England  and Wales, India, Pakistan, Estonia, France, Georgia, Russia, Italy, and Poland.  In a separate  article, he provides information regarding the shifting treatment of confessions or guilty pleas  under the Dutch criminal law that applied in Indonesia and the 1981 KUHAP, as well as  perspectives from Islamic law, and analyzes the proposed approach under article 199 of the  RUU KUHAP in this context.

Introduction  \nMalaysia introduced a formal plea bargaining process into its Criminal Procedure Code (CPC)  through amendments passed in 2010, which also included other pretrial processes.  The relevant  provisions came into force in June 2012.  Prior to these amendments, it appears that some form  of plea bargaining, namely charge bargaining, did take place in Malaysia. One commentator  stated that this practice was quite common in drug cases, where a defendant’s lawyer would  write a letter to the Attorney General’s office seeking a reduction of the charge, to which the  defendant would plead guilty.  The judge in the case would not know that a plea bargain had  taken place.  Other authors also note that plea bargaining “had  taken  place  since  the  early   introduction  of  the  civil  court  system,  yet without proper guidelines and procedures.” 5    "}

In reforming the said process, it is recommended that such  changes should significantly support such victims to heal and seek solace as well as  reconciliation. Finally, such reform should create a legal culture that revolves around  restorative justice, which seeks not only to restore the gendered harm to such victims but  also to give voice to these marginalized victims through the ethos of victim reparation,  offender responsibility, and communities of care. The experiences in other jurisdictions  such as the USA, the UK and Australia on the plea-bargaining process and victims’  protection in such process might prove to be invaluable lessons for Malaysia to learn.  Future research on the similar legal positions to protect victims’ rights in Malaysia and  those jurisdictions would be vital to shine a light on such issue.   "}

Though not all the members of the Russian legal community  welcomed this new procedural development, it proved to be efficient and rapidly  gained popularity among legal practitioners.   \nI.  Historic Background  \nPrecursors of plea bargaining in Russia were introduced in the mid-nineteenth century, when  Russian law equated admission of guilt to other types of evidence subject to evaluation  “according to the inner judges’ belief based on the totality of circumstances discovered in the  course of investigation and trial.” 1  That was the time of the Great Reforms of  Tsar Alexander II,  when jury trials were introduced in the Russian Empire. Article 681 of the Statute of Criminal  Procedure of 1864 established a possibility of summary proceedings as an alternative to full- fledged judicial hearings. These provisions were later replicated in the first Soviet Code of  Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) of 1922 and in its  later version of 1923.   \nChanges in the mid-1950s and early 1960s resulted in new codification of criminal procedural  legislation.

Usually, they came in the form of a verbal arrangement between the defense  attorney and the investigator on easing the restrictive pretrial conditions on the suspect in  exchange for information on the criminal case in question.

If the state prosecutor or the victim (in a private prosecution\nwhere the victim has submitted a complaint directly to the court and acts as a prosecutor) agree,\nthe defendant can give his consent to the charges and request sentencing without a trial.” Also,\nthe special procedure defined in Chapter 40 of the CCP applies only to crimes punishable by\nimprisonment not exceeding a 10-year term. The judgment rendered in the special procedure\ncannot be appealed on the grounds of inconsistency between the findings of the court and the\nmerits of the case. Apparently, there is similarity between the Russian special trial procedure and\nthe US nolo contendere procedure, in which a defendant does not contest the charges and gives his\nconsent for the proposed sentence.8\n\nMany Russian legal scholars have pointed out that this new procedure polarized the Russian legal\ncommunity and was heatedly debated by its supporters and opponents.

Also,  the special   procedure defined in Chapter 40 of the CCP applies only to crimes punishable by  imprisonment not exceeding a 10-year term. The judgment rendered in the special procedure  cannot be appealed on the grounds of inconsistency between the findings of the court and the  merits of the case. Apparently, there is similarity between the Russian special trial procedure and  the US  nolo contendere  procedure, in which a defendant does not contest the charges and gives his  consent for the proposed sentence.   \nMany Russian legal scholars have pointed out that this new procedure polarized the Russian legal  community and was heatedly debated by its supporters and opponents. Some experts noted that  the special   procedure violates several fundamental principles of criminal procedure.  I.A.  Piskalov asserts that the special procedure contradicts both the principles of criminal procedure  and the Constitution of Russia, and proposes removing Chapter 40 from the Code of Criminal  Procedure of the RF. In particular, this discrepancy is manifested in the absence of judicial  autonomy in evaluation of evidence and a defendant’s formal consent to the charges without their  corroboration by incriminating evidence.  Igor Petrukhin points out that Chapter 40 was adopted  in an atmosphere of strong antagonism against its opponents; he asserts that this is why the  wording of the chapter is far from perfect.  M.R. Kel’biiev argues that, in the special procedure,  the defendant plays the key role, whereas the opinions of the prosecutor and the victim(s) possess  secondary importance, and the defense attorney performs mainly consultative functions.

Referral for CCR  \nA criminal case generally goes through CCMS prior to CCR. If the case is unresolved after CCMS,  it may be referred for  $\\mathrm{CCR},$   if all parties voluntarily agree.  CCR generally is considered only for  cases that have a reasonable prospect of early resolution.   \nC.  Judge Facilitation  \nIn contrast to CCMS, CCR is facilitated by a senior and experienced judge and conducted in the  judge’s chambers.  If the case remains unresolved at CCR and proceeds to trial, the CCR judge  will not be assigned to hear the case as the trial judge.    \nThe role of the judge in CCR sessions is facilitative but not evaluative. According to the Registrar’s  Circular, the judge would not give any indicative assessment of the relative merits of the case for  the prosecution and the defense, although the judge may comment on specific aspects of  evidence, possible inferences, or legal issues as appropriate.    \nD.   Conduct of CCR  \nDepending on the complexity of the case and other relevant factors, the number of CCR sessions  per case may vary but would ordinarily be not more than two sessions in one case.   \nThe judge facilitating the CCR sessions may consider giving a sentence indication in an  appropriate case. However, in order to avoid any perception of the accused person being  coerced or pressured to plead guilty, a sentence indication would only be considered if such  indication is sought by the accused person.  Sufficient information should be provided to the  CCR judge for a proper assessment to be made. Such information includes a summary of the  facts by the prosecution, the accused person’s antecedent records, and mitigating factors, if any.  Both the prosecution and the defense are asked to provide their input prior to a sentence  indication being given.   "}
