Under the \\$3.75 billion credit agreement, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. At December 31, 2018, this ratio was approximately 25 to 1. Debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. Apart from the committed facilities, an additional  $\\S243$  million in stand-alone letters of credit and bank guarantees were also issued and outstanding at December 31, 2018.

The operating income of this subsidiary is immaterial as a percent of 3M's consolidated operating income for 2018. The Venezuelan government sets official rates of exchange and conditions precedent to purchase foreign currency at these rates with local currency. The government has also operated various expanded secondary currency exchange mechanisms that have been eliminated and replaced from time to time. Such rates and conditions have been and continue to be subject to change. For the periods presented, the financial statements of 3M's Venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured utilizing the rate associated with the secondary auction mechanism, Tipo de Cambio Complement a rio, which was redesigned by the Venezuelan government in June 2017 (DICOM), or its predecessor. During the same periods, the Venezuelan government's official exchange was Tipo de Cambio Protegido (DIPRO), or its predecessor. During the third quarter of 2018, the Venezuelan government effected a conversion of its currency to the Sovereign Bolivar(VES),essentially equating to its previous Venezuelan Bolivar divided by 1 oo,ooo.3M's uses of these rates were based upon evaluation of a number of factors including, but not limited to, the exchange rate the Company's Venezuelan subsidiary may legally use to convert currency, settle transactions or pay dividends; the probability of accessing and obtaining currency by use of a particular rate or mechanism; and the Company's intent and ability to use a particular exchange mechanism. The Company continues to monitor these circumstances.

The State also sought declarations under MERLA that 3M is responsible for all damages the State may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of PFAS into the environment, and that 3M is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life, and other damages under the MWPCA.

In December 2017, the court urged the parties to attempt to resolve the litigation before trial, and in January 2018, the court appointed a mediator to facilitate that process.

The expansion of alignment of customer accounts within additional countries increased the attribution of dual credit across 3M's business segments.

The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales.
