Each category has different criteria including Academic Background, Professional Career, Annual Salary, Age, and various Bonus Points that include accomplishments like Research Achievements, Positions, and Qualifications.\n\nFor each category, a specific set of required points (70 in each case) need to be accumulated for eligibility. The Academic Background section assigns points for different degrees, Professional Career awards points based on years of experience, and Annual Salary points are assigned based on salary levels as per the table. The Age section gives a certain number of points based on the applicant's age group. \n\nThere are multiple Bonus Points sections that can be earned for various achievements and attributes like research achievements, position in a company, language proficiency, educational background, and more. \n\nAdditionally, the table outlines requirements such as the minimum annual salary needed for points allocation and research achievements criteria. Each section is designed to accumulate enough points for a candidate to meet the required threshold for the desired immigration category."}

Points can be claimed for the number of years of  business experience (minimum of three years), amount of investment funds available, English- language ability, and age. Bonus points can be claimed for having an investment of at least  NZ\\$750,000 (about US\\$496,200) in growth investments.  The full points table is provided in  Appendix II of this report.  \nAn EOI will be entered into the pool if the person meets the health and character requirements  (and others included in the EOI also meet certain requirements), claims at least one point for  English language ability, is aged 65 years or under, has claimed points for a minimum of three  years of business experience, has claimed points for a minimum of   $\\mathrm{NZ}\\S3$   million investment  funds, and confirms he or she meets the “fit and proper person” requirements.  EOIs entered  into the pool are ranked on the basis of total points claimed and may be selected “according to  their points ranking in quantities sufficient to fulfill the annual approval cap.” 32  An EOI is current  for a period of six months from its initial submission to the pool. After that period, it will be  withdrawn from the pool.   \nA person whose EOI is selected from the pool may be invited to apply for a resident visa under  the Investor 2 Category if the information provided does not indicate the presence of any relevant  health or character issues and a business immigration specialist considers that the person’s claims  with respect to the points for the different aspects are credible.  Once an invitation to apply for  the visa has been issued, the person must submit an application within four months of the issue  date.  The application will be assessed based on various factors, including that the applicant  “qualifies for the points on the basis of which their EOI was selected from the Pool.” 36   "}

Number of Immigrants\n\nThe estimated population of the UK, as of mid-2018, was reported to be 66.4 million people.® The\nmain source of growth of the UK population is net migration. In the year ending November 2019,\n212,000 more people entered the UK with the intention to stay 12 or more months than left, with\n609,000 people immigrating to the UK and 397,000 emigrating from the UK.1° One in seven of the\npopulation is foreign born.\" The five most common countries that foreign-born UK residents\ncome from are India, Poland, Pakistan, Romania, and the Republic of Ireland.'2\n\nIII. The Points-Based Migration System\n\nThe law governing, and policy surrounding, immigration in the UK is highly complex and\nsuccessive governments have attempted to balance the needs of genuine visitors and the\ncontributions they make to the economy of the UK with concerns about those that wish to enter\nfor undesirable purposes. This report details the points-based system for worker migration into\nthe UK and whether or not their dependent family members are eligible to join them. Given the\ncomplexity of the immigration system, this report provides a necessarily high-level overview.\n\nUK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) is responsible for implementing the points-based system,\nwhich aims to provide a simplified immigration system and attract migrants who will contribute\nto the UK. As the purpose of the majority of the points-based worker categories is to fill positions\nthat cannot be filled by a UK resident, there is a resident labor market test that must be performed.\nThis is designed to ensure that there are no UK residents that are able to perform the job for which\nthe employer sponsors a migrant worker.'9\n\nThe system is structured so that emphasis is placed on employers who sponsor applicants to keep\ntrack of their employees and report any suspected abuses to UKVI.\"4 The objective of tying these\nrequirements to the employer is to improve compliance with the immigration system and\nreduce abuse.!5\n\n° Overview of the UK Population: August 2019, Office for National Statistics (Aug. 23, 2019),\nhttps: / / perma.cc/533D-MXL3\n\n10 Migration Statistics Quarterly Report: November 2019, Office for National Statistics (Nov. 28, 2019),\nhttps: / / perma.cc/6WWJ-3HQZ.\n\n11 Population of the UK by Country of Birth and Nationality: 2018, Office for National Statistics (May 24, 2019),\nhttps:/ / perma.cc/96F7-ZV8G.\n\n?

Number of Immigrants  \nThe estimated population of the UK, as of mid-2018, was reported to be 66.4 million people.  The  main source of growth of the UK population is net migration. In the year ending November 2019,  212,000 more people entered the UK with the intention to stay 12 or more months than left, with  609,000 people immigrating to the UK and 397,000 emigrating from the UK.  One in seven of the  population is foreign born.  The five most common countries that foreign-born UK residents  come from are India, Poland, Pakistan, Romania, and the Republic of Ireland.   \nIII.  The Points-Based Migration System   \nThe law governing, and policy surrounding, immigration in the UK is highly complex and  successive governments have attempted to balance the needs of genuine visitors and the  contributions they make to the economy of the UK with concerns about those that wish to enter  for undesirable purposes. This report details the points-based system for worker migration into  the UK and whether or not their dependent family members are eligible to join them. Given the  complexity of the immigration system, this report provides a necessarily high-level overview.      \nUK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) is responsible for implementing the points-based system,  which aims to provide a simplified immigration system and attract migrants who will contribute  to the UK. As the purpose of the majority of the points-based worker categories is to fill positions  that cannot be filled by a UK resident, there is a resident labor market test that must be performed.   This is designed to ensure that there are no UK residents that are able to perform the job for which  the employer sponsors a migrant worker.   \nThe system is structured so that emphasis is placed on employers who sponsor applicants to keep  track of their employees and report any suspected abuses to UKVI.  The objective of tying these  requirements to the employer is to improve compliance with the immigration system and  reduce abuse.    "}

Criticisms of the System\n\nThe points-based system, in operation for close to two decades, has faced criticism with respect\nto a number of areas.

Others have argued that a policy to reduce net\nmigration to the UK through caps has resulted in the system becoming rigid and not fit\nfor purpose:\n\n... the tinkering with what was a flexible system has culminated in a system which\nis anything but points based. All supply side logic has dissipated, the admission\nsystem is now rigid, high skilled immigration has all but disappeared from\nBritain’s knowledge economy, and far from enhancing tourism as the design of\nthe PBS was intended, the tier five visitor visa has become so convoluted it is\nlabyrinthine in its complexity.108\n\nA House of Commons Library Briefing Paper noted the system has been criticized for\n\n[fJail[ing] to live up to its stated objectives such as simplicity, transparency, objectivity and\nflexibility.
