It is the Group's practice to\nbuild a material element of stretch\nperformance into the budget.\nAchievement of this stretching\nROCE target will result in a target\nCDP outcome. The threshold\n\nand maximum are a fair range of\nROCE outcomes that represent a\nlower limit of underperformance\nbelow which no CDP award\nshould be made, and an upper\nlimit of outperformance that\nwould represent the maximum\nCDP award.\n\nBecause a material element\n\nof stretch performance is built\ninto the budget (and hence the\nROCE target derived from the\nbudget), together with physical\nand regulatory asset constraints,\nthe performance range around\ntarget is subject to a greater\n\nlevel of downside risk than\n\nthere is upside opportunity.\nAccordingly, the range between\nthreshold and target is greater\nthan that between target and\nmaximum.

This was partially offset by the slower than planned\nSpence Growth Option concentrator ramp-up due to tailings\nwork, permits and water availability, and the inclusion of the\nabove-budget portion of additional direct costs of COVID-19.\n\n- In Petroleum, driven mainly by higher than expected gas demand\nand improved performance in Australia, combined with lower\nmaintenance activity at Australian operations, partially offset by\nthe inclusion of the above-budget portion of additional direct\ncosts of COVID-19.\n\n", "vlm_text": "The table provides information on \"ROCE\" (Return on Capital Employed) with the following columns:\n\n1. **Financial measure**: ROCE\n2. **Scorecard targets**: \n   - FY2021 target was 13.5%, with a threshold of 11.6% and a maximum of 15.0%.\n   - The target ROCE is derived from the annual budget and includes a \"stretch\" performance target.

Feedback from shareholders is used by the Remuneration Committee\nin its decision-making in respect of the remuneration policy and its application. The Group also conducts regular employee engagement\nsurveys which give employees an opportunity to provide feedback on a wide range of employee matters. Many employees are also ordinary\nshareholders through Shareplus and therefore have the opportunity to share their views as shareholders\n\nSimplicity The purpose, structure and strategic alignment of each element of remuneration is clearly set out in section 2.2.2.\n\nRisk A significant portion of variable remuneration is at-risk in order to provide strong alignment between remuneration outcomes and the\ninterests of BHP shareholders. The delivery of two-thirds of CDP awards in deferred shares and the LTIP five-year performance period help\nto align the long-term interests of the CEO and shareholders.\n\nPredictability The remuneration opportunities under different performance scenarios (minimum, target and maximum) are set out in section 2.2.2.\n\nProportionality\n\nThe CEO is incentivised to achieve stretching performance through the targets set under the CDP and LTIP. In addition, the Remuneration\nCommittee has discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes downwards to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.\n\nAlignment\nwith culture\n\nThe FY2021 CDP performance measures for the CEO include a number of measures linked to culture including the delivery of social value\nplans for assets, improving gender diversity and embedding a new Engagement and Perception Survey system. We continue to focus on\nfostering a culture of respect and ensuring the workplace is safe at all times.\n\n", "vlm_text": "The table outlines principles and how the Remuneration Committee applies each one.

They conduct surveys for employee feedback, giving them a voice as shareholders.\n\n2. **Simplicity**: Details of remuneration structure and strategy are set out in a specific section (2.2.2).\n\n3. **Risk**: A large portion of variable remuneration is designed to align with shareholder interests over the long term. CDP awards are mostly in deferred shares, with a five-year performance period.\n\n4. **Predictability**: Remuneration opportunities in different scenarios are detailed in section 2.2.2.\n\n5. **Proportionality**: CEO performance targets ensure challenging goals, with committee discretion to adjust outcomes if needed.\n\n6. **Alignment with culture**: Performance measures for the CEO include cultural initiatives, improving diversity, and workplace safety, supported by an Engagement and Perception Survey system."}

The Group contributed US$334 million during the financial year (2020: US$260 million; 2019: US$274 million) to defined\ncontribution plans and multi-employer defined contribution plans. These contributions are expensed as incurred.\n\nDefined benefit\npension schemes\n\nFor defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement so as to recognise\ncurrent and past service costs, net interest cost on the net defined benefit obligations/plan assets and the effect of any\ncurtailments or settlements. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. An asset or liability is consequently\nrecognised in the balance sheet based on the present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets, except\nthat any such asset cannot exceed the present value of expected refunds from and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\nDefined benefit obligations are estimated by discounting expected future payments using market yields at the reporting date on\nhigh-quality corporate bonds in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate\nbond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to national government bonds. In both instances, the\nbonds are selected with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash flows.\n\nhe Group has closed all defined benefit pension schemes to new entrants.

In some cases, the benefits are provided through\nmedical care schemes to which the Group, the employees, the retirees and covered family members contribute.

In 2020, our first-year audit of the Group, we\nused a materiality threshold of US$700 million, which was approximately 5% of the Group's 30 June 2020 profit before\ntax and exceptional items from continuing operations. We believe that a three-year average of Group profit before tax\nand exceptional items from continuing operations provides the most relevant measure to the users to assess the financial\nperformance of the Group due to the volatility in commodity prices impacting current levels of profitability. Had we\nbased our assessment of materiality on the same basis as 2020, the 2021 materiality would have been in excess of\nUS$900 million. Exceptional items are defined in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$80 million (2020: US$95 million), which is 1% of total assets.\nTotal assets is an appropriate basis to determine materiality for an investment holding company, and 1% is a typical\npercentage of total assets to use to determine materiality.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and considered it to still be appropriate based on the\nfinal profit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations.\n", "vlm_text": "The table appears to describe the concept of materiality and how it is determined in the context of financial statement audits. It consists of two main sections:\n\n1. **What we mean**: This section defines materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that could influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements. It states that materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of audit procedures.\n\n2. **Basis of Materiality and determination**: This section explains the determination of materiality levels for both the Group and the Parent Company. \n   - For the Group, materiality is set at US$900 million, approximately 5% of the three-year average profit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations. In 2020, a materiality threshold of US$700 million was used, which was about 5% of the Group’s mid-2020 profit before these items. The section explains why a three-year average is used, and notes that had the same basis been applied as in 2020, the 2021 materiality would have exceeded US$900 million.\n   - For the Parent Company, materiality is determined to be US$80 million (2020: US$95 million), which is 1% of total assets. The section justifies that total assets are an appropriate basis for an investment holding company, and 1% is a typical percentage used. During the audit, initial materiality was reassessed and considered still appropriate."}

This data includes the training provided to apprentices and trainees as part of the FutureFit  Academy in Australia during FY2021, which totals more than 500,000 hours (on average over 1,100 hours per employee). \n\n (7)\t The calculation includes primary parental leave only and does not include secondary parental leave. Secondary parental leave is a two-week parental leave benefit for the non-primary  caregiver. All BHP employees are eligible for parental leave.

In Canada, species may occur under more than one category. In these instances, the higher ranking has been reported.

{"layout": 4037, "type": "text", "text": "(19)\t The financial control approach to report GHG emissions is based on the accounting treatment in the company’s consolidated financial statements, as follows: 100 per cent for operations  accounted for as subsidiaries, regardless of equity interest owned; and for operations accounted for as a joint operation, the company’s interest in the operation. This approach does not  report GHG emissions from operations which are accounted for using the equity method in the company’s financial statements. As BHP does not control or have access to the data from all  operations in which it holds equity, certain assumptions have been made to estimate equity share GHG emissions from operations not under BHP’s operational control. Details are provided  in note (20). Comparison of year on year financial control GHG emissions may not be possible due to the assumptions made.\n\n (20)\tNon-operated assets include Antamina, Cerrejón, the Kelar Power Station and the Petroleum assets in Australia, USA and Algeria. Samarco is excluded as operations re-commenced in  FY2021 and Samarco has not published their latest data and prior year data will not reflect Samarco becoming operational in FY2021. GHG emissions data was sourced directly from the  operator in the first instance and, where not readily available for the current reporting year, FY2020 or CY2020 data was extrapolated to reflect FY2021 production levels. This allowed  recalculation of prior year GHG emissions for some assets which were previously estimated using GHG emissions intensities based on analogous BHP operations. For equity share reporting  of GHG emissions from non-operated assets, FY2020 originally reported data that is restated on this basis is 3,800 ktCO 2 -e for Scope 1 GHG emissions, 130 ktCO 2 -e for Scope 2 GHG  emissions and 3,930 ktCO 2 -e for total GHG emissions. For financial control based GHG emissions reported from non-operated assets, FY2020 originally reported data that is restated is  3,430 ktCO 2 -e for Scope 1 GHG emissions, 10 ktCO 2 -e for Scope 2 GHG emissions and 3,440 ktCO 2 -e for total GHG emissions. Non-operated assets’ GHG emissions are based on third  party (operators’) estimates and are therefore not subject to the same level of review and assurance by BHP as GHG emissions within BHP’s operational control boundary. \n\n (21)\t Scope 3 GHG emissions have been calculated using methodologies consistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard  (Scope 3 Standard). Scope 3 GHG emissions reporting necessarily requires a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the  commodities we produce and consume. More information on the calculation methodologies, assumptions and key references used in the preparation of our Scope 3 GHG emissions data  can be found in the associated BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG Emissions Calculation Methodology, available at bhp.com/climate.\n\n (22)\tIn FY2021, we have made improvements in how we calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with the purchased goods and services category by assigning more accurate emission  factors to some procurement categories and improving the accuracy of spend data. Previously reported GHG emissions for the ‘Purchased goods and services (including capital goods)’  category are 16.9 MtCO 2 -e in FY2020 and 17.3 MtCO 2 -e in FY2019. Previously reported emissions for FY2019 are 0.1 MtCO 2 -e in the ‘Business travel’ category and <0.1 MtCO 2 -e for the  ‘Employee commuting’ category. GHG emissions in FY2020 did not materially change as a result of the improved methodology.\n\n (23)\tIn FY2021, we have made improvements in how we calculate Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with the ‘Fuel and Energy related activities’ category by removing the Scope 3 GHG  emissions associated with natural gas consumption at our Petroleum operations as the majority of those emissions would be captured in our Scope 1 GHG emissions. Previously reported  GHG emissions for the ‘Fuel and Energy related activities’ category are 1.3 MtCO 2 -e in FY2020 and also in FY2019.\n\n (24)\tIncludes product transport where freight costs are covered by BHP, for example under Cost and Freight (CFR) or similar terms, as well as purchased transport services for process inputs to  our operations.\n\n (25)\tProduct transport where freight costs are not covered by BHP, for example under Free on Board (FOB) or similar terms.\n\n (26)\tFor BHP, this category covers the Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on an equity basis) from our assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP. In FY2021, GHG  emissions estimates from non-operated assets were developed from data provided directly by operators. GHG emissions from our non-operated Kelar Power Station asset are reported as  Scope 2 GHG emissions at the Minerals Americas operated assets supplied by the facility and therefore excluded from our Scope 3 GHG emissions totals. The previous FY2020 value of  3.9 MtCO 2 -e has been restated to remove GHG emissions from the Kelar Power Station and include updated Scope 3 GHG emissions estimates for non-operated assets for which data was  previously unavailable from operators. FY2021 Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions (on an equity basis) from Cerrejón are only accounted for H1FY2021 due to the effective economic date  of 31 December 2020 for sale of BHP’s interest in Cerrejón. Details on assumptions and operations included are provided in note (20).\n\n (27)\tAll iron ore production and metallurgical coal is assumed to be processed into steel and all copper metal production is assumed to be processed into copper wire for end use. Processing of  nickel, zinc, gold, silver, ethane and uranium oxide is not currently included, as production volumes are much lower than iron ore and copper and a large range of possible end uses apply or  downstream GHG emissions are estimated to be immaterial. Processing/refining of petroleum products is also excluded as these GHG emissions are considered immaterial compared to the  end-use product combustion reported in the ‘Use of sold products’ category.\n\n (28)\tIn FY2021, we have addressed some key limitations associated with estimating Scope 3 GHG emissions. We have worked to eliminate double counting in our reported inventory in relation  to GHG emissions from the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal in steelmaking, by allocating GHG emissions between the two and reporting a single total Scope 3 GHG emissions  figure for GHG emissions from steelmaking. Allocation of steelmaking GHG emissions to BHP’s metallurgical coal is based on the global average input mass ration of metallurgical vs iron ore  to the blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steelmaking route. This approach to improving accuracy is consistent with the Scope 3 Standard. We have also improved the accuracy of  the emission factor used to estimate Scope 3 GHG emissions by reflecting the blast furnace integrated steelmaking route into which the majority of BHP’s steelmaking raw materials portfolio  is sold. The improved estimation also considers BHP iron ore product quality and its impact on the amount of ore required to produce steel. As our product evolves in its quality and flow  through to other pathways (such as direct reduced iron electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF)), we will adjust the balance of intensity factors to reflect these changes. Previously reported numbers  for iron ore processing are 205.6-322.6 MtCO 2 -e for FY2020 and 197.2-299.6 MtCO 2 -e for FY2019. Previously reported numbers for metallurgical coal are 33.7-108.2 MtCO 2 -e for FY2020  and 34.7–111.4 MtCO 2 -e for FY2019. \n\n (29)\tAll crude oil and condensates are conservatively assumed to be refined and combusted as diesel. Energy coal, natural gas and natural gas liquids are assumed to be combusted.  FY2021 Scope 3 GHG emissions associated with energy coal products from Cerrejón are only accounted for H1FY2021 due to the effective economic date of 31 December 2020 for  sale of BHP’s interest in Cerrejón.\n\n (30)\tWe reported a total figure for the Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory this year as major double counting of GHG emissions from the processing of iron ore and metallurgical coal in  steelmaking was removed, however a degree of overlap in reporting boundaries still occurs due to our involvement at multiple points in the life cycle of the commodities we produce  and consume.
