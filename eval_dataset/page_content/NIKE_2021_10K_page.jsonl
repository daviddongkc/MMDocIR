These\ntrends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are\nfacing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the\nindustry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional\nmeasures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.\n\nWe monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to\nmitigate trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and\nadvocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization\nfor footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements.

In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade\nassociations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent\nwith international trade rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community.\n\nWhere trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products\nobtained from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted\nand we could experience an adverse financial impact.

In certain European countries, we are required by local law to enter into, and/or comply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. \nDIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION (DE&I) \nDE&I is a strategic priority for NIKE and we are committed to having an increasingly diverse team and culture. We aim to foster an inclusive workplace through recruitment, development and retention of diverse talent with the goal of expanding representation across all dimensions of diversity over the long term. In fiscal 2021, we elevated our DE&I team to sit at the heart of NIKE’s People and Culture Strategy and combined our Talent and Diversity & Inclusion teams under a single leader. We also announced certain targets for the Company to work toward by fiscal 2025, including increasing representation of women in our global corporate workforce and leadership positions, as well as increasing representation of U.S. racial and ethnic minorities in our U.S. corporate workforce and at the Director level and above. \nWe have enhanced our efforts to recruit diverse talent through our traditional channels and launched new initiatives, such as partnerships with athletes and sports-related organizations to create apprenticeship programs and new partnerships with organizations, colleges and universities that serve diverse populations. Additionally, we are prioritizing DE&I education so that all NIKE employees and leaders have the cultural awareness and understanding to build diverse and inclusive teams. We also have Employee Networks, collectively known as NikeUNITED, representing various employee groups. \nOur DE&I focus extends beyond our workforce and includes our communities, which we support in a number of ways. We have committed to investments through both the NIKE and Jordan Brands that aim to address racial inequality and improve diversity and representation in our communities. We also are leveraging our global scale to accelerate business diversity, including investing in business training programs for women and increasing the proportion of services supplied by minority-owned businesses.

Risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic include, but are not limited to: \n•  Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally; \n•  Reduced consumer demand for our products if consumers seek to reduce or delay discretionary spending in response to the impacts of COVID-19, including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates and diminished consumer confidence; •  Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries, including in the United States, and bans on large public gatherings, which have reduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers; •  Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior; •  The risk that any safety protocols in NIKE-owned or affiliated facilities, including our offices, will not be effective or not be perceived as effective, or that any virus-related illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities, whether accurate or not; •  Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements, including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer, rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks, COVID-19 testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces; •  Disruption to our distribution centers and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including through the effects of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures; •  Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result in cancellation or reduction of their orders; •  Operational risk, including but not limited to cyber security risks, as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements, and restrictions on employee travel; •  Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate or increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses; and \n•  Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future. \nWe continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating, financial and tax planning projections, including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic. However, we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments. In particular, we believe the ultimate impacts on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on, among other things, the further spread and duration of COVID-19, the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness, the availability, widespread distribution and acceptance, as well as the safety and efficacy of vaccines for COVID-19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic. Even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery, should those regions fail to fully contain COVID-19 or suffer a COVID-19 relapse, those markets may not recover as quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business, operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks. \nIn addition, the impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us. "}

We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores, could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. \nAdditionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. \nThe success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values. \nOur success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel.

These actions include contractual measures such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example, confidential information related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely, inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. \nIn addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected. \nWe are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation. \nIn addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time. Any breach of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers', users' or employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention, impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach. \nIn addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018; and California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \"CCPA\") which became effective on January 1, 2020, and additional jurisdictions are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations. These laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently enacted laws (including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under GDPR and CCPA) and regulations can be costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputation al risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits. \nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws, additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate. \nWe earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change. \nProposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax rate. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass, several of the proposals considered, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows. \nPortions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under various tax holidays. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters. These holidays expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate.

We sell our products through NIKE-owned retail stores and through digital platforms (which we refer to collectively as our “NIKE Direct” operations), to\nretail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world. Our goal is to deliver value to our\nshareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses. Our strategy is to achieve long-term revenue growth\nby creating innovative, “must-have” products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital\nplatforms and at retail.\n\nSince fiscal 2018, through the Consumer Direct Offense and our Triple Double strategy, we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation, increasing our speed and agility\nto market and growing our direct connections with consumers. In June 2020, we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the Consumer Direct Offense strategy:\nConsumer Direct Acceleration. This strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas. First, creating the marketplace of the future through more premium, consistent and\nseamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need. This strategy will lead with NIKE Digital and our owned stores, as well as\nthrough select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision. Second, we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct\nfocused on Men’s, Women’s and Kids'. This approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs, including more specialization of\nour category approach, while re-aligning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities. In particular, we expect to reinvest in our Women’s and\nKids’ businesses and also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the Company to optimize effectiveness. Third, we will unify investments in data and analytics,\ndemand sensing, insight gathering, inventory management and other areas against an end-to-end technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation. We believe\nthis unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business, while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally. As such, our\nnew financial goals through fiscal 2025 are outlined below:\n\n* High single-digit to low double-digit revenue growth;\n\n* Gross margin rate in the high 40s by fiscal 2025;\n\n» Earnings before interest and taxes as a percent of revenues (\"EBIT Margin\") in the high teens by fiscal 2025;\n* Mid to high teens diluted earnings per share growth;\n\n- Exceeding low 30% range rate of return on invested capital (ROIC); and\n\n- Annual capital expenditures at roughly 3% of Revenues.\n\nAs a result of our strategic acceleration, management announced on July 22, 2020, a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up our\nexecution. These changes resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and during fiscal 2021, we incurred pre-tax charges of $294 million, which relate to employee\ntermination costs and, to a lesser extent, stock-based compensation expense. All related actions are now substantially complete, and we expect future annual wage-related\nsavings will be reinvested to execute against this next phase of our strategy. For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, see Note 21 —\nRestructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nCOVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThroughout fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business results and operations globally. Our business and wholesale partners experienced temporary store\nclosures and stores operating on reduced hours, as a result of mandatory lockdowns across our North America, EMEA and APLA geographies. Additionally, disruption in the\nglobal supply chain due to container shortages, transportation delays and U.S. port congestion interrupted the flow of our inventory. Despite the disruption caused by the\npandemic, we achieved record Revenues for fiscal 2021, which increased 19% to $44.5 billion, compared to the prior fiscal year, with gross margin expansion of 140 basis\npoints. We ended the fiscal year with Inventories down 7% compared to May 31, 2020, and our liquidity position remains strong with $13.5 billion of Cash and equivalents and\nShort-term investments, an increase of $4.7 billion compared to May 31, 2020.\n\nOur NIKE Direct business fueled our growth throughout the year as we navigated the pandemic, leveraging our digital platforms with our store footprint to connect directly with\nthe consumer. NIKE Brand digital revenues grew 60% on a currency-neutral basis, with strong double-digit growth across each of our geographies. Despite temporary store\nclosures throughout the year, due to COVID-19 safety-related measures, we experienced a 4% increase in comparable store sales, driven by growth in Greater China and\nNorth America, partially offset by declines in EMEA and APLA.

The NIKE Brand, which represents over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, experienced\ngrowth of 19%, up 17% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by increases across all geographies. NIKE Direct grew 30% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 60% growth in\ndigital, with all geographies growing strong double digits, while wholesale revenues grew 10%. Revenues for Converse increased 19% and 16%, on a reported and currency-\nneutral basis, respectively, led by strong double-digit growth in digital.\n\nIncome (loss) before income taxes increased 131% for fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher revenues, gross margin expansion and selling and administrative expense leverage.\nNIKE, Inc. gross margin increased 140 basis points primarily due to annualizing the impacts of COVID-19 including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory\nobsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. The increase in gross margin also reflects\nhigher full-price product margins across wholesale and NIKE Direct. Selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower Demand creation expense, partially offset by\nhigher Operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail\noperations, as well as lower sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. These decreases were partially offset by higher digital marketing\ninvestments. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs and $255 million in\nrestructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and travel and related expenses. ROIC as of May 31, 2021, was 48.8% compared to 21.5% as of May\n31, 2020. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further information.\n\nDuring fiscal 2020, we entered into definitive agreements to sell our NIKE Brand businesses in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay and to shift to a distributor operating\nmodel. During fiscal 2021, the transaction with Grupo SBF S.A. to purchase substantially all of our NIKE Brand operations in Brazil closed. Additionally, during the third quarter\nof fiscal 2021, we mutually agreed with Grupo Axo to terminate the sale and purchase agreement for the transition of NIKE’s businesses in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay to a\ndistributor partnership. However, as we remain committed to selling the legal entities in all three countries and granting distribution rights to third-party distributors, the assets\nand liabilities of the entities have remained classified as held-for-sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 31, 2021.

Lower other costs are due to annual i zing certain impacts of COVID-19 from fiscal 2020, including lower factory cancellation charges, lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments. \nTOTAL SELLING AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE \nThe table displays financial data in millions of dollars across three fiscal years (2021, 2020, 2019) for:\n\n1. **Demand Creation Expense:**\n   - Fiscal 2021: $3,114\n   - Fiscal 2020: $3,592\n   - Change from 2020 to 2021: -13%\n   - Fiscal 2019: $3,753\n   - Change from 2019 to 2020: -4%\n   \n2. **Operating Overhead Expense:**\n   - Fiscal 2021: $9,911\n   - Fiscal 2020: $9,534\n   - Change from 2020 to 2021: 4%\n   - Fiscal 2019: $8,949\n   - Change from 2019 to 2020: 7%\n   \n3. **Total Selling and Administrative Expense:**\n   - Fiscal 2021: $13,025\n   - Fiscal 2020: $13,126\n   - Change from 2020 to 2021: -1%\n   - Fiscal 2019: $12,702\n   - Change from 2019 to 2020: 3%\n   \n4. **Percentage of Revenues:**\n   - Fiscal 2021: 29.2%\n   - Fiscal 2020: 35.1% (590 basis points decline)\n   - Fiscal 2019: 32.5% (260 basis points increase from 2019 to 2020)\nDemand creation expense decreased   $13\\%$   for fiscal 2021, due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations, as well as lower sports marketing expense as sporting events were postponed due to COVID-19. This activity was partially offset by higher digital marketing investments. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2021. \nOperating overhead expense increased  $4\\%$   for fiscal 2021, due to an increase in strategic technology investments, higher NIKE Direct variable costs, and approximately  $\\S255$  million in restructuring-related costs, partially offset by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and related expenses. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased Operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2021. \nOTHER (INCOME) EXPENSE, NET \nThe table presents \"Other (income) expense, net\" in millions of dollars for three fiscal years:\n\n- Fiscal 2021: $14 million\n- Fiscal 2020: $139 million\n- Fiscal 2019: $(78) million\nOther (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the re measurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.

Unit sales of apparel increased  $26\\%$  , while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 1 percentage point. Lower ASP per unit was primarily due to a lower mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, in part reflecting lower discounts. \nReported EBIT increased  $58\\%$   as higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense more than offset a decline in gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately 110 basis points primarily due to lower NIKE Direct margins and unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, which more than offset lower product costs and lower other costs. The decrease in other costs was primarily due to annual i zing the impacts of COVID-19, including lower inventory obsolescence reserves, as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments.

Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are: •  Product Costs — NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways: \n\n1. Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity: a. Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC. b. Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar. In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost. 2.

Net income, adjusted for non-cash items,\ngenerated $6,612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to $3,730 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business\noperations from the impact of COVID-19. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of\n$45 million for fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of $1,245 million for fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital was impacted by a $2,361 million decrease in\nInventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19. An increase in Accounts\nPayable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the\nnet change in working capital was impacted by a $2,845 million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of $3,800 million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of $1,028 million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher\npurchases of short-term investments. During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of $3,276 million\ncompared to a cash inflow of $27 million in fiscal 2020. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically\nfocused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to\nmake annual capital expenditures of approximately 3% of annual revenues.\n\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $1,459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of $2,491 million for fiscal 2020. This change was primarily\ndue to the net proceeds from a $5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing\nshare repurchase program. The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began repurchasing shares\nunder the program. In fiscal 2021, we purchased 4.9 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $650 million (an average price of $133.54 per share) under the four-\nyear, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2021, we had repurchased 50.0 million shares at a cost of $4,669\nmillion (an average price of $93.33 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash.\nThe timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.\n\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf’) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount\nof debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022.\n\nOn August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to\nincrease borrowings up to $3 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the\nclosing date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August 16, 2026. This facility replaces the prior $2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on August\n28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020. On March 15, 2021, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for\nup to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on March 14, 2022, with a 364-day\nextension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond March 13, 2023. This facility replaces the prior $2\nbillion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6, 2020, which would have matured on April 5, 2021. As of May 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were outstanding under\nour committed credit facilities.

Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated  $\\S6{,}612$   million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to  $^{\\S3,730}$   million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of COVID-19. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of  $\\S45$   million for fiscal 2021, compared to a decrease of   $^{\\S1,245}$   million for fiscal 2020. The net change in working capital was impacted by a  $\\mathbb{S}2,361$   million decrease in Inventories, driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to COVID-19. An increase in Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital, primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of COVID-19. In addition, the net change in working capital was impacted by a  $\\S2{,}845$   million increase in Accounts receivable, net, primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. \nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an outflow of   $\\S3{,}800$   million for fiscal 2021, compared to an outflow of  $^{\\S1,028}$   million for fiscal 2020, primarily driven by higher purchases of short-term investments. During fiscal 2021, the net change in investments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash outflow of  $^{\\S3,276}$   million compared to a cash inflow of  $\\S27$   million in fiscal 2020. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain. In future periods, we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately  $3\\%$   of annual revenues. \nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of  $^{\\S1,459}$   million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of  $^{\\S2,491}$   million for fiscal 2020. This change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a \\$5,942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower share repurchase s during fiscal 2021. \nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, to enhance our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchase s under our existing share repurchase program. The existing program remained authorized by the Board of Directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we began re purchasing shares under the program. In fiscal 2021, we purchased 4.9 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for  $\\S650$   million (an average price of  $\\S133.54$   per share) under the four- year,  $\\S15$   billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. As of May 31, 2021, we had repurchased 50.0 million shares at a cost of   $\\mathbb{S}4{,}669$  million (an average price of  $\\S93.33\\$   per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchase s will come from operating cash flows and excess cash. The timing and the amount of share repurchase s will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions. \nCAPITAL RESOURCES \nOn July 23, 2019, we filed a shelf registration statement (the “Shelf”) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 23, 2022. \nOn August 16, 2019, we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to  $\\S2$   billion of borrowings, with the option to increase borrowings up to  $\\S3$   billion in total upon lender approval. The facility matures on August 16, 2024, with a one-year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond August 16, 2026. This facility replaces the prior  $\\mathbb{S}2$   billion credit facility agreement entered into on August 28, 2015, which would have matured August 28, 2020.

The facility matures on March 14, 2022, with a 364-day extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date, provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond March 13, 2023. This facility replaces the prior  $\\S2$  billion credit facility agreement entered into on April 6, 2020, which would have matured on April 5, 2021.

Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the\nagreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction\nprice is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale\ntransactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale\ncustomer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and\nmiscellaneous claims from customers. We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an\noffsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other\ncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of\nboth contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.\n\nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from\ncustomers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and\nclaims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different\nthan reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.\n\nRefer also to Note 1 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 16 — Revenues for additional information in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nINVENTORY RESERVES\n\nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net\nrealizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and\nthe estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable\nvalue of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.\n\nCONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS\n\nA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line\nbasis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation\nexpense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a\nspecified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period\nbased on our best estimate of the endorser's performance.

We estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nThe provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date. \nEstimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made. \nRefer also to Note 1 — Summary of Significant  Accounting  Policies and Note 16 — Revenues  for additional  information in the accompanying  Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nINVENTORY RESERVES \nWe make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.  \nCONTINGENT PAYMENTS UNDER ENDORSEMENT CONTRACTS \nA significant amount of our Demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract. \nCertain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports (e.g., winning a championship). We record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal. \nCertain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). When we determine payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period. \nCertain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which we record in Cost of sales as the related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within Demand creation expense. \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEFINITE-LIVED ASSETS\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.

Any\nimpairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\n\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES\n\nWe use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and\nliabilities. When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are\nrecorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in\ngains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One\nof the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions.\nBy their very nature, our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the designated amount of\nanticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period\nor within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge\ncontract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the\nadditional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.\n\nINCOME TAXES\n\nWe are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant\njudgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This\nestimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-\ndate Income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we\ncontinually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our\nexpected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.\n\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, when necessary. Realization of deferred tax assets (such as net operating loss carry-forwards) is dependent\non future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain. At least quarterly, we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable\nincome. To the extent we believe that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset, which increases our Income tax expense in\nthe period when such determination is made.\n\nWe have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions. The amount of\nearnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our U.S.\nand foreign entities. Withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore.\n\nWe carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the\npresumption of repatriation. Despite this approach, because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings\nare generated, the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated. For instance, the actual cash needs of our U.S. operations\nmay exceed our current expectations, or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations. This would result in additional withholding tax\nexpense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore.\n\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based\non factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition\nof a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES\nABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nIn the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in\nthe value of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such\nexposures; we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management\nprogram is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We\nuse forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and\npayables, including third-party and intercompany transactions. We have, in the past, and may in the future, also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the\nnet assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries. Where exposures are\nhedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThe timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the\nnature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted\ntransaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31,\n2021, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar\ncurrency pairs. Refer to Note 14 — Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n\nOur earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of\ninterest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and\nfixed-rate debt of varying maturities.\n\nMARKET RISK MEASUREMENT\n\nWe monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-\nRisk (“VaR”). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, intercompany loans\ndenominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.\n\nWe use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum\npotential one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%\nconfidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and\ninterest rates (a “variance/co-variance” technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the\npreceding one-year period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential\nloss in option value for the estimated sensitivity (the “delta” and “gamma’) to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency\nrate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated\ntransactions, firm commitments, cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.\n\nThe VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in\nmarket rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or\ndifferences in market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.\n\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $92 million and $48\nmillion as of May 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The VaR increased year-over-year as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2021.

Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs.

The data is presented in millions of dollars and categorized by the type of derivative instrument.\n\n1. **Foreign exchange forwards and options:**\n   - 2021: $(150) million\n   - 2020: $76 million\n   - 2019: $166 million\n\n2. **Embedded derivatives:**\n   - 2021: $(17) million\n   - 2020: $(1) million\n   - 2019: $7 million\n\nThe location of gain or loss recognized in income on these derivatives is reported under \"Other (income) expense, net\". The dollar amounts shown in parentheses represent losses, while those without represent gains.\nCASH FLOW HEDGES \nAll changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until Net income is affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure. When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the associated derivative as an un designated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company. \nThe purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non- functional currency denominated revenues, inter company revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other inter company transactions. \nProduct cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases and the foreign currency adjustment program described below.
