This logic ends with a   free and open Indo-Pacific, but it begins with a given: the United States should not compete alone with a rising PRC.  Rather, our strategy calls for a collective response that punctures the PRC’s narrative of a bilateral Great Power Competition, amplifies U.S.   efforts, and pools the shared ambitions, resources and national power of our like- minded partners.  To achieve every other strategic goal in the JRS, the United States   must deepen its ties with allies and like-minded partners, leverage a constellation of   multilateral and minilateral groups to converge around shared principles, and   operationalize our partnerships to achieve concrete outcomes in the Indo-Pacific.   Moreover, our democratic alliances enable us to advance our shared objectives,   promote high standards, establish effective international rules, and hold countries like   the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea   (DPRK) to account. The USG will reaffirm, invest in, and modernize Indo-Pacific alliances   with Australia, Japan, the Philippines, the ROK, and Thailand. The U.S. will work with   allies to share responsibilities equitably, while encouraging them to invest in their own   comparative advantages against shared current and future threats. The U.S. will also   deepen its engagement with existing and emerging partners including New Zealand,   Singapore, Indonesia, Taiwan, and Vietnam — all regional partners that are critical for supporting an open, rules-based international order in which the merits of the U.S.   approach effectively counter negative influence from adversaries.

State/EAP and the Asia Bureau are   concerned by an increase in government efforts across the region to shrink the space for civil society and democratic institutions through increased restrictions on human rights,   particularly freedoms of expression, assembly, and association. We see it in the   genocide and crimes against humanity being committed against predominantly Muslim   Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang and other human   rights violations committed in Tibetan regions of China.  We see it in persecution and the imprisonment of opposition politicians, anti-corruption activists, labor rights, human   rights defenders, lawyers, and journalists in Hong Kong, Cambodia, and the Philippines.    We see it in nonviolent protesters being killed, beaten, and imprisoned in Burma after   the February 2021 coup d’etat by the same military who earlier committed genocide   against the Rohingya and other ethnic groups and that has now reversed much of the   progress the country had achieved in transitioning to democracy and improving human rights and freedoms. Governments in the region are increasingly exploring options to   restrict NGOs, as we see in Thailand, and have increasingly cracked down on internet   and media freedoms in places like Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia.  These alarming   trend lines are being worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which those in power have   used as pretext to target critics, restrict freedom of assembly, and further repress   human rights.
