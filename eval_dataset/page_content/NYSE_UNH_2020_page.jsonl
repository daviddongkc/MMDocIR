United Healthcare Medicare & Retirement offers a full range of supplemental products at a diversity of price points. These products cover various levels of coinsurance and deductible gaps to which seniors are exposed in the traditional Medicare program. \nPremium revenues from CMS represented  $36\\%$   of UnitedHealth Group’s total consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, most of which were generated by United Healthcare Medicare & Retirement. \nUnited Healthcare Community & State \nUnited Healthcare Community & State is dedicated to serving state programs caring for the economically disadvantaged, the medically underserved and those without the benefit of employer-funded health care coverage, typically in exchange for a monthly premium per member from the state program. United Healthcare Community & State’s primary customers oversee Medicaid plans, including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF); Children’s Health Insurance Programs (CHIP); Dual SNPs (DSNPs); Long-Term Services and Supports (LTSS); Aged, Blind and Disabled; and other federal, state and community health care programs. As of December 31, 2020, United Healthcare Community & State participated in programs in 31 states and the District of Columbia, and served 6.6 million people; including more than 1.1 million people through Medicaid expansion programs in 16 states under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). \nStates using managed care services for Medicaid beneficiaries select health plans by using a formal bid process or by awarding individual contracts. A number of factors are considered by United Healthcare Community & State when choosing programs for participation, including the state’s commitment and consistency of support for its Medicaid managed care program in terms of service, innovation and funding; the eligible population base, both immediate and long term; and the structure of the projected program. United Healthcare Community & State works with its state customers to advocate for actuarially sound rates, commensurate with medical cost trends. \nThese health plans and care programs are designed to address the complex needs of the populations they serve, including the chronically ill, people with disabilities and people with a higher risk of medical, behavioral and social conditions. United Healthcare Community & State administers benefits for the unique needs of children, pregnant women, adults, seniors and those who are institutionalized or are nursing home eligible. These individuals often live in medically underserved areas and are less likely to have a consistent relationship with the medical community or a care provider. They also often face significant social and economic challenges. \nUnited Healthcare Community & State leverages the national capabilities of UnitedHealth Group locally, supporting effective care management, strong regulatory partnerships, greater administrative efficiency, improved clinical outcomes and the ability to adapt to a changing national and local market environment. United Healthcare Community & State coordinates resources among family, physicians, other health care providers, and government and community-based agencies and organizations to facilitate continuous and effective care and often addresses other social determinants affecting people’s health status and health system usage. \nApproximately   $75\\%$   of the people in state Medicaid programs are served by managed care, but this population represents only approximately  $50\\%$   of total Medicaid spending. United Healthcare Community & State’s business development opportunities include entering fee-for-service markets converting to managed care; and growing in existing managed care markets, including state expansions to populations with more complex needs requiring more sophisticated models of care, including DSNP and LTSS programs. Our offerings to state expansion cover more medically complex populations, including integrated care management of physical, behavioral, long-term care services and supports, and social services by applying strong data analytics and community-based collaboration.

Premium revenues\nfrom risk-based products comprise nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. If we fail to predict accurately,\nor effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider\ncontracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services\nrendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies\nand Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period\nand is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is\nbased on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and\nMedicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed\ncontract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or\nbids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual\nservices, large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, such as COVID-19, the introduction of new or costly\ndrugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of\nessential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small\ndifferences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result\nin significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2020 medical costs for commercial insured\nproducts had been 1% higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such\nproducts, our annual net earnings for 2020 would have been reduced by approximately $290 million, excluding\nany offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which\nclaims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove\ninaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate,\nintegrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not\noperate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members,\ncustomers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated,\nand the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding.

Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Our premium revenue on commercial policies and Medicaid contracts is typically based on a fixed monthly rate per individual served for a 12-month period and is generally priced one to six months before the contract commences. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS in June the year before the contract year. Although we base the commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, increased cost of individual services, large-scale medical emergencies, pandemics, such as COVID-19, the introduction of new or costly drugs, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues can result in significant changes in our financial results. For example, if our 2020 medical costs for commercial insured products had been  $1\\%$   higher than our actual medical costs, without proportionally higher revenues from such products, our annual net earnings for 2020 would have been reduced by approximately  $\\S290$   million, excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment or from reduced premium rebates due to minimum MLRs. \nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. \nIf we fail to maintain properly the integrity or availability of our data or successfully consolidate, integrate, upgrade or expand our existing information systems, or if our technology products do not operate as intended, our business could be materially and adversely affected. \nOur business is highly dependent on the integrity and timeliness of the data we use to serve our members, customers and health care professionals and to operate our business. The volume of health care data generated, and the uses of data, including electronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to implement new and innovative services, price adequately our products and services, provide effective service to our customers in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, and report accurately our results of operations depends on the integrity of the data in our information systems. In addition, connectivity among technologies is becoming increasingly important and recent trends toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technologies, including more sophisticated applications for mobile devices. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards and changing customer preferences. If the data we rely upon to run our businesses is found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience failures in our health, wellness and information technology products; lose existing customers; have difficulty attracting new customers; experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing; have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud; have disputes with customers, physicians and other health care professionals; become subject to regulatory sanctions or penalties; incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences.

Further, if we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions, which further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. \nSuccess in completing acquisitions is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operations, including our internal control environment and culture, or otherwise leveraging its operations which may present challenges different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for us to manage.

Our failure to comply with U.S. or non-U.S. laws and regulations governing our conduct outside the United States or to establish constructive relations with non-U.S. regulators could adversely affect our ability to market our products and services, or to do so at targeted operating margins which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nThe health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity, including as a result of governmental investigations, adverse media coverage and political debate surrounding industry regulation. Negative publicity may adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation in various markets. \nAs a result of our participation in various government health care programs, both as a payer and as a service provider to payers, we are exposed to additional risks associated with program funding, enrollments, payment adjustments, audits and government investigations which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \nWe participate in various federal, state and local government health care benefit programs, including as a payer in Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, various Medicaid programs and CHIP, and receive substantial revenues from these programs. Certain of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. \nThe government health care programs in which we participate generally are subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage, reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For example, CMS has in the past reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks, and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members’ benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. \nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies seek bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs.

If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions is materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submission by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

As the health system returned to normal seasonally adjusted\nlevels of care, we have seen business activity approach normal levels. COVID-19 will also continue to influence\ncustomer and consumer behavior, both during and after the pandemic, which could impact how care is delivered\nand the manner in which consumers wish to receive their prescription drugs or infusion services. The impact of\nCOVID-19 on our care provider and payer clients could impact the volume and types of services Optum\nprovides, as well as the pacing of potential new business opportunities.

Other significant changes in sources or uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in customer funds administered and net purchases of investments, and decreases in net issuances of long-term debt and short-term borrowings, cash paid for acquisitions and share repurchases. \nFinancial Condition \nAs of December 31, 2020, our cash, cash equivalent, available-for-sale debt securities and equity securities balances of  $\\S59.0$   billion included  $\\S16.9$   billion of cash and cash equivalents (of which  $\\S1.3$   billion was available for general corporate use),   $\\S39.8$   billion of debt securities and  $\\S2.3$   billion of equity securities. Given the significant portion of our portfolio held in cash equivalents, we do not anticipate fluctuations in the aggregate fair value of our financial assets to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital position. Other sources of liquidity, primarily from operating cash flows and our commercial paper program, which is fully supported by our bank credit facilities, reduce the need to sell investments during adverse market conditions.

If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, an impairment is recognized for the difference, up to the carrying amount of goodwill. \nWe estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projections of free cash flow, including revenue trends, medical costs trends, operating productivity, income taxes and capital levels; long-term growth rates for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted periods; and discount rates. Financial projections and long-term growth rates used for our reporting units are consistent with, and use inputs from, our internal long-term business plan and strategies. Discount rates are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecasts. Our most significant estimate in the discount rate determinations involves our adjustments to the peer company weighted average costs of capital reflecting reporting unit-specific factors. "}

The passage of time and the availability of additional information\nregarding areas of uncertainty with respect to the reporting units’ operations could cause these assumptions to\nchange in the future. Additionally, as part of our quantitative impairment testing, we perform various sensitivity\nanalyses on certain key assumptions, such as discount rates, cash flow projections and peer company multiples to\nanalyze the potential for a material impact.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest\nexpense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt, as well as foreign currency exchange\nrate risk of the U.S. dollar primarily to the Brazilian real and Chilean peso.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $20 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with\nmarket interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2020,\n\n$8 billion of our financial liabilities, which include commercial paper, debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest\nrates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fixed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31,\n2020, $37 billion of our investments were fixed-rate debt securities and $45 billion of our debt was non-swapped\nfixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments\nand fixed-rate debt.

As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, for reporting units where a quantitative analysis is performed, the Company performs an annual impairment test measuring the fair values of the reporting units and comparing them to their aggregate carrying values including goodwill. The estimates of the reporting unit fair values are calculated using a discounted cash flow method or a weighted combination of discounted cash flows and a market-based method. The discounted cash flow method includes assumptions about revenue trends, medical cost trends, and operating costs as well as discount rates. The market-based method requires determination of an appropriate group of peer companies whose securities are traded on an active market. The fair values of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values as of the impairment testing date, therefore no impairment was recognized. \nWe identified a critical audit matter related to the quantitative analysis performed for such reporting units because of the significant assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit. This required increased auditor judgment and extent of effort, including involvement of fair value specialists to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to peer company selection and financial projections, which can be impacted by regulatory and macro-economic factors.

Because of regulatory\nrequirements, certain investments are included in long-term investments regardless of their maturity date. The\nCompany classifies these investments as held-to-maturity and reports them at amortized cost.

Equity investments, with certain exceptions, are measured at fair value with changes in fair\nvalue recognized in net earnings.\n\nThe Company excludes unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities from net\nearnings and reports them as comprehensive income and, net of income tax effects, as a separate component of\nequity. To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies\nthe cost of each investment sold.\n\nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the\npresent value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less\nthan amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or\ncircumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an\nallowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through\nother comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to\nsell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings.\n\nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments.

The products and services under the AARP Program\ninclude supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals\nbetween 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products.\n\nPursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s\ngeneral investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are\ninvested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not\nguarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to\nanother entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date\nof transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate\nstabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under\nmanagement are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities.\n\nThe effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the\noverall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance.

To calculate realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities, the Company specifically identifies the cost of each investment sold. \nThe Company evaluates an available-for-sale debt security for credit-related impairment by considering the present value of expected cash flows relative to a security’s amortized cost, the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and specific events or circumstances which may influence the operations of the issuer. Credit-related impairments are recorded as an allowance, with an offset to investment and other income. Non-credit related impairments are recorded through other comprehensive income. If the Company intends to sell an impaired security, or will likely be required to sell a security before recovery of the entire amortized cost, the entire impairment is included in net earnings. \nNew information and the passage of time can change these judgments. The Company manages its investment portfolio to limit its exposure to any one issuer or market sector, and largely limits its investments to investment grade quality. Securities downgraded below policy minimums after purchase will be disposed of in accordance with the Company’s investment policy. \nAssets Under Management \nThe Company provides health insurance products and services to members of AARP under a Supplemental Health Insurance Program (the AARP Program) and to AARP members and non-members under separate Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D arrangements. The products and services under the AARP Program include supplemental Medicare benefits, hospital indemnity insurance, including insurance for individuals between 50 to 64 years of age, and other related products. \nPursuant to the Company’s agreement with AARP, program assets are managed separately from the Company’s general investment portfolio and are used to pay costs associated with the AARP Program. These assets are invested at the Company’s discretion, within investment guidelines approved by AARP. The Company does not guarantee any rates of return on these investments and, upon any transfer of the AARP Program contract to another entity, the Company would transfer cash equal in amount to the fair value of these investments at the date of transfer to the entity. Because the purpose of these assets is to fund the medical costs payable, the rate stabilization fund (RSF) liabilities and other related liabilities associated with this AARP contract, assets under management are classified as current assets, consistent with the classification of these liabilities. \nThe effects of changes in other balance sheet amounts associated with the AARP Program also accrue to the overall benefit of the AARP policyholders through the RSF balance. Accordingly, the Company excludes the effect of such changes in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. "}
