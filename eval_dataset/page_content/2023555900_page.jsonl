International Conventions in Related Areas\n\nFrance is a party to two international conventions that address repatriation policies in contexts\nthat do not apply to the remains of persons who die in immigration detention but which may be\nof general interest.\n\nUnder article 116 of the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War,\nwhich applies in cases of armed conflict between nations, the detaining power has to cover the\ncosts up to its international borders.!2 From this point, the power on which the prisoner depends\nis responsible for the further costs of repatriation or transfer to the neutral country.!5\n\nThe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1983,\nwhich concerns the transfer of living persons deprived of liberty for criminal offenses, provides\nin its article 17, “any costs incurred in the application of this Convention shall be borne by the\nadministering State, except costs incurred exclusively in the territory of the sentencing State.”14\nThe administering State is defined as “the State to which the sentenced person may be, or has\nbeen, transferred in order to serve his sentence.” 15\n\nThese two conventions adopt a similar position on the costs of repatriation of prisoners of war\nand persons serving criminal sentences. Such costs shall be borne by the state or authority\nrequesting the transfer. The country where the prisoner is located is generally not responsible for\nthese costs, except those incurred exclusively in their territory.\n\nAnother Council of Europe treaty deals with the transportation of deceased persons between\nsignatory countries. This is the 1973 Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses.!* However, this\nagreement does not contain any rules on the costs of repatriation. It only establishes a set of rules\nfor the transport of human remains across international borders (Iaissez-passer, characteristics of\nthe coffin, and additional precautions to be taken when death was due to certain\ninfectious diseases).\n\n12 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, art. 116, Aug. 12, 1949, 75 U.N.T.S. 135,\nhttps:/ / perma.cc/RZR3-ZR2B.\n\nBd.\n\n14 Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, art. 17, Mar. 21, 1983, E.T.S.

It would appear the payment by the consulate of transportation  costs would depend on the laws of the deceased’s country of origin.   \nIII.  International Conventions in Related Areas  \nFrance is a party to two international conventions that address repatriation policies in contexts  that do not apply to the remains of persons who die in immigration detention but which may be  of general interest.  \nUnder article 116 of the 1949 Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War,  which applies in cases of armed conflict between nations, the detaining power has to cover the  costs up to its international borders.  From this point, the power on which the prisoner depends  is responsible for the further costs of repatriation or transfer to the neutral country.   \nThe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, adopted by the Council of Europe in 1983,  which concerns the transfer of living persons deprived of liberty for criminal offenses, provides  in its article 17, “any costs incurred in the application of this Convention shall be borne by the  administering State, except costs incurred exclusively in the territory of the sentencing State.” 14   The administering State is defined as “the State to which the sentenced person may be, or has  been, transferred in order to serve his sentence.” 15    \nThese two conventions adopt a similar position on the costs of repatriation of prisoners of war  and persons serving criminal sentences. Such costs shall be borne by the state or authority  requesting the transfer. The country where the prisoner is located is generally not responsible for  these costs, except those incurred exclusively in their territory.   \nAnother Council of Europe treaty deals with the transportation of deceased persons between  signatory countries. This is the 1973 Agreement on the Transfer of Corpses.  However, this  agreement does not contain any rules on the costs of repatriation. It only establishes a set of rules  for the transport of human remains across international borders ( laissez-passer , characteristics of  the coffin, and additional precautions to be taken when death was due to certain  infectious diseases).
