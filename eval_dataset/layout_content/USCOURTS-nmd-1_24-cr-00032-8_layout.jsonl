{"layout": 17, "type": "text", "text": "  Here the Court finds that the government may use the proposed exhibits in its opening  statement. With respect to Exhibits 3B, 4D, 7A, 7E, 11A, 11B, and 21D, the defense has not  objected to the admissibility of these exhibits. As such, counsel can fairly expect that these exhibits  will come into evidence during the trial and can present them during opening statement. The Court  has already found that Exhibits 9A, 11D, 11G, 11F, 14G and 25C, as well as the cropped version  of 11I, are relevant and admissible. Thus, the government can also fairly expect that these exhibits  will come into evidence and can present them during opening statement. However, the government  is reminded that they cannot refer to the plastic wrappers depicted in Exhibit 14G as “kilo  wrappers.” The Court has reserved ruling on Exhibits 6F and 11C, pending the government’s  ability to lay a foundation for these exhibits. Nevertheless, the Court finds that it would not be  unfairly prejudicial or misleading for the government to use Exhibits 6F and 11C in its opening  statement, as the government expects to be able to establish their relevance. Of course, if they are  unable to do so, the Court will issue a curative instruction. Lastly, any potential prejudice to Mr.  Diaz will be cured by the Court’s preliminary instruction to the jury that opening statements are  not evidence and should not be considered as such.
