{"layout": 178, "type": "text", "text": "The Chengdu of today is almost un recognisable compared with the city I knew in the mid-1990s. Cars have largely replaced bicycles, and the city has grown upwards and outwards with incredible speed. Virtually all the old neighbourhoods have been swept away, along with their grand old courtyard buildings, teahouses, markets and the traditional street life for which the city was famed. In their place have appeared skyscrapers, wide streets and shopping malls that are smart and modern but could be anywhere in the world. Clearly the city had to be modernised, and the new apartments are far more comfortable to live in than the old wooden houses, but I do regret that some of the ancient parts of the city were not preserved, like the charming area to the east of the Minshan hotel, with its narrow lanes and interesting architecture. However, despite the total reinvention of the fabric of the city, Chengdu still has something of its old magic, in the atmosphere, the dialect, the laid-back character of the people, and, of course, the food! People still put out a few tables and chairs and create an impromptu teahouse wherever they can, and talk about food all the time. I am glad that some green spaces have been preserved along the river, and that the Wenshu Monastery, River-Viewing Pavilion Park and the Qingyang Temple, where I used to learn  qigong  retain their old beauty and distinctiveness.
