It categorizes responses into two groups: those who would not want to apply for jobs using a hiring algorithm and those who would. The percentages reflect attitudes towards hiring algorithms, including realism, effectiveness over human hiring, enthusiasm, and worry about the concept.\n\n- **Realistic**: 52% would not want to apply, 86% would.\n- **Better than humans (well-qualified)**: 17% would not want to apply, 52% would.\n- **Better than humans (diverse backgrounds)**: 21% would not want to apply, 49% would.\n- **Enthusiastic**: 14% would not want to apply, 49% would.\n- **Worried**: 35% would want to apply, 77% would not want to apply.\n\nThe survey was conducted from May 1-15, 2017, as part of the \"Automation in Everyday Life\" study."}
