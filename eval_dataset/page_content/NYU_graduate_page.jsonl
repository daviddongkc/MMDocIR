Our halls have many opportunities to get connected to other students as well as NYU  faculty and staff members. We encourage you to get involved in your residence hall council  by running for an elected position or simply engaging in programming, service, and advocacy.  NYU’s Inter-Residence Hall Council (IRHC) is another way to get involved in the greater NYU  community. IRHC’s three pillars are student advocacy, service, and community events. IRHC  hosts many community events including Welcome Week, service weeks, Town Halls, FLURRY  ice skating event in Central Park, UltraViolet Live talent competition, and a semi-formal dance  at an iconic NYC venue. The National Residence Hall Honorary (NRHH) is another way to get  involved on campus. NRHH focuses on recognizing residential students who go above and be­ yond. Your NYU experience begins the day you move into your residence hall. Take advantage  of this great community by getting connected! "}
