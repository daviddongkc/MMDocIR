These systems shall  inform the operator about the presence of people and other vehicles within the radius of the  vehicle’s movement trajectory.” 8  The rules also required the application of “software that would  provide for timely informing the personnel about the danger of collisions, possible crashes with  pedestrians, danger zone alerts, and other violations of safe use of mining equipment.” 9   ", "page_idx": 56, "bbox": [71, 265.323486328125, 542, 415.3157958984375], "page_size": [612.0, 792.0]}
