( 2018 ) recently intro- duced a multi-domain dialogue dataset (Multi- WOZ), which adds new challenges in DST due to its mixed-domain conversations. As shown in Fig.  1 , a user can start a conversation by asking to reserve a restaurant, then requests information regarding an attraction nearby, and ﬁnally asks to book a taxi. In this case, the DST model has to de- termine the corresponding domain, slot and value at each turn of dialogue, which contains a large number of combinations in the ontology, i.e., 30 (domain, slot) pairs and over 4,500 possible slot values in total. Another challenge in the multi- domain setting comes from the need to perform multi-turn mapping. Single-turn mapping refers to the scenario where the  (domain, slot, value)  triplet can be inferred from a single turn, while in multi- turn mapping, it should be inferred from multiple turns which happen in different domains. For in- stance, the  (area, centre)  pair from the  attraction domain in Fig.  1  can be predicted from the  area  in- formation in the  restaurant  domain, which is men- tioned in the preceding turns.
