By staying true to our culture, Costco has continued to succeed, despite the\nchallenging business environment.\n\nThe past year presented many challenges due to inflationary pressures in commodities, labor and transportation. Our buying\nstaff around the world exhibited diligence and perseverance in developing and executing on strategies to minimize the impact\nto both our members and the business. Our business model, including limiting SKU counts, focusing on the most productive\nitems, and bringing goods to market in high volumes, can not only sustain but provide opportunities in even challenging\ncircumstances.\n\nWe had strong operating results in fiscal 2022. Net sales for the 52-week fiscal year totaled $222.7 billion, an increase of 16%,\nwith a comparable sales increase of 14%.

Operating these IT systems and networks, and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, is critical to our business operations and strategy. Increased remote work has also increased the possible attack surfaces. Threats designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks and data, both ours and third parties with whom we work, are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crimes and advanced persistent threats. Phishing attacks have emerged as particularly prominent, including as vectors for ransomware attacks, which have increased in breadth and frequency. While we train our employees as part of our security efforts, that training cannot be completely effective. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our data. It is possible that our IT systems and networks, or those managed by third parties such as cloud providers or suppliers that otherwise host confidential information, could have vulnerabilities, which could go unnoticed for a period of time. While our cybersecurity and compliance efforts seek to mitigate such risks, there can be no guarantee that the actions and controls we and our third-party service providers have implemented and are implementing, will be sufficient to protect our systems, information or other property. \nThe potential impacts of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation, government enforcement actions, penalties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in IT systems and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. This could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition and, critically in light of our business model, loss of member confidence. Further, the insurance coverage we maintain and indemnification arrangements with third-parties may be inadequate to cover claims, costs, and liabilities relating to cybersecurity incidents. In addition, data we collect, store and process is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and other privacy and cybersecurity laws across the various states and around the globe, which may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance.

We define\ncomparable sales as net sales from warehouses open for more than one year, including remodels,\nrelocations and expansions, and sales related to e-commerce websites operating for more than one\nyear. Comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing shopping frequency from new and existing\nmembers and the amount they spend on each visit (average ticket). Sales comparisons can also be\nparticularly influenced by certain factors that are beyond our control: fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates (with respect to our international operations); inflation and changes in the cost of gasoline and\nassociated competitive conditions. The higher our comparable sales exclusive of these items, the more\nwe can leverage our SG&A expenses, reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability.\nGenerating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right\nmerchandise at the right prices, a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long-\nterm. Another substantial factor in net sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do\nbusiness, including the effects of inflation or deflation, especially the United States. Net sales growth and\ngross margins are also impacted by our competition, which is vigorous and widespread, across a wide\nrange of global, national and regional wholesalers and retailers, including those with e-commerce\noperations. While we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in\ncompetition, we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these\nchanges, such as through adjustments to our pricing and merchandise mix, including increasing the\npenetration of our private-label items, and through online offerings.\n\nOur philosophy is to provide our members with quality goods and services at competitive prices.

The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and\npricing strategies in response to cost increases. Those strategies can include, but are not limited to,\nworking with our suppliers to share in absorbing cost increases, earlier-than-usual purchasing and in\ngreater volumes, offering seasonal merchandise outside its season, as well as passing cost increases on\nto our members.

We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign- exchange contracts, see Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report. A hypothetical   $10\\%$   strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by  $\\S\\,128$   and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount. \nCommodity Price Risk \nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.
