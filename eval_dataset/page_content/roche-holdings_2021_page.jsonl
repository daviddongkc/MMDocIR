It contains the annual financial  statements, consolidated financial statements and  non-financial performance indicators. It covers  all regions and divisions of the Roche Group from  1 January to 31 December 2021. The financial  reporting scope is defined and outlined in our  Finance Report, and there have been no significant  changes in scope in 2021 compared to 2020. \nGRI standards and materiality \nWe have followed the GRI (Global Reporting  Initiative) G4 guidelines since 2014, and transitioned  to the GRI Standards in 2017. By using the GRI  guidelines, we disclose the most critical impacts  of our activities on the environment, society  and the economy. In this respect, we conducted  a first materiality analysis at the corporate  level in 2014. In 2018/2019, we conducted a  second global materiality assessment including  expert interviews and feedback from more than  600 stakeholders. The results of this assessment  are featured on pages 24 and 25 of this report  and are also published on our website ( see link  on page 24 ). \nRisk management \nOur Risk Management Policy sets out Roche’s  approach to identifying, analysing, managing  and reporting internal and external risks and  opportunities. A consolidated Group Risk Report,  which covers all material risks and opportunities, is  discussed annually with the Corporate Executive  Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.  The effectiveness of the Group Risk Management  Process is regularly monitored by the Group  \nRisk Advisory team and the overall process  reviewed by the Audit Committee of the Board of  Directors, and reviewed externally when appropriate.  Risk management is embedded at all levels of the  Roche Group. Our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics  divisions and global functions conduct a formal  risk and opportunity assessment process at least  once a year and must develop response plans for  their most material risks and opportunities. \nRead more in ‘Corporate Governance’ on page 140. \nWe also identify long-term business sustainability  trends with associated risks and opportunities  on an annual basis and integrate these into our  existing Group Risk Management Process. Each  year, emerging trends (including associated risks  and opportunities) are identified from internal  and external sources. \nBased on these findings the Sustainability Steering  Committee prioritises and selects the top business  sustainability trends. Among those identified trends  are healthcare evolution and societal crises.  \nUN Sustainable Development Goals \nWe support the United Nations Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) within the sphere of  our corporate business strategy. We contribute  to a number of the SDGs and are particularly  pleased to see a dedicated goal on health (SDG 3).  This goal is closely connected with the achievement  of universal health coverage, which goes hand  in hand with better access to quality essential  medicines and diagnostics. This fits in perfectly  with our vision to improve and save lives. Since  2016, the SDGs have been an integral part of our  annual reporting. "}

This  latest set of syndromic respiratory solutions  allows clinicians to choose the appropriate tests  based on the healthcare setting, any seasonal  outbreaks, and patient needs. By testing only what  is medically relevant and necessary, they enable  targeted therapy, avoid misuse of antibiotics and  reduce unnecessary intervention.  \nThrough our acquisition of the TIB Molbiol Group  in December, we are able to further expand our  portfolio with more than 45 CE-IVD assays and more  than 100 research use assays on our LightCycler  PCR systems and MagNA Pure sample preparation  systems. We have successfully partnered with  TIB Molbiol for more than 20 years and this  collaboration was instrumental in creating our  first SARS-CoV-2 detection test in January 2020,  mere days after this novel virus had first been  sequenced.

New approaches are needed,  and we are going to do our part to bring about  solutions. \nOur efforts during the pandemic – joining  forces for patients and society COVID-19 spurred us to rethink how we partner  to develop diagnostics and treatment options,  and to work at speeds we never could have  imagined, all with the goal of delivering innovation  for patients.  \nBuilding on our partnering efforts from 2020,  we continued to work with Gilead Sciences on  a combination study evaluating two medicines  (Roche’s Actemra/RoActemra and Gilead’s Veklury)  in hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19- associated pneumonia. We also furthered our  work with Regeneron on its antibody cocktail of  casirivimab and imdevimab (Ronapreve)   ( please see  the story on page 55 ). And we worked with Atea  \nPharmaceuticals on AT-527, their investigational  antiviral medicine for COVID-19.  \nRonapreve  \n\n •\t  In March, new phase III data showed that  Ronapreve reduced hospitalisation or death by   $70\\%$   in non-hospitalised patients with COVID-19.\n\n •\t  In April, a phase III prevention trial showed that  subcutaneous administration of Ronapreve  reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19  infections by  $81\\%$  .\n\n •\t  In June, the University of Oxford announced  preliminary phase III results from the UK  RECOVERY study in patients hospitalised with  COVID-19. Results showed that Ronapreve  reduced the risk of death in those who had not  mounted a natural antibody response of their  own (seronegative).\n\n •\t  In July, Japan was the first country to approve  Ronapreve for treatment of mild to moderate  COVID-19, followed by EU approval for treatment  and prevention in November.\n\n •\t  In September, phase II/III trial data showed that  Ronapreve significantly reduced viral load within  seven days of treatment in patients hospitalised  with COVID-19.\n\n •\t  In September, the WHO recommended the use  of Ronapreve in non-severe COVID-19 patients  who are at highest risk of severe disease, and in  patients with severe and critical infection who  have a seronegative status.\n\n •\t  In October, Ronapreve (together with Actemra/ RoActemra and AT-527) was included in the EU  Commission’s portfolio of the ten most promising  COVID-19 treatments.

Today, we  are ushering in a new era in which physicians use  novel, more sensitive quantitative measures and  patients are empowered to monitor themselves  for a variety of diseases. The ability to establish  a deep understanding of a patient’s metrics, both  on a daily basis and over time, can lead to more  tailored, more effective care.  \n\nData indicates that continuously reporting  symptoms of disease or effects of cancer therapy  can facilitate a shared approach to disease  management between patients and their care teams.  It can also increase survival and improve quality of  life, while reducing symptom burden, emergency  room visits, and hospital is at ions. \nThe continued reliance on clinic visits as the  primary way to assess and monitor patients remains  a fundamental limitation of healthcare. Personal  technologies, including wearables and medical  devices, can allow patients to play a more active  role in tracking and managing their health.  \nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an insidious and  unpredictable disease that can be hard to track and  measure. The launch of the smartphone application  Floodlight in the US, Germany and Finland helps  make precision monitoring a reality for people living  with MS. Through simple tasks, such as drawing a  shape, the app enables physicians and patients  to shed a light on the impact of the disease on the  individual patient. Furthermore, each data point  contributes to a unique data set designed to move  MS research forward.  \nIn collaboration with Moorfields Eye Hospital in  London, Roche piloted Home Vision Monitor, an  interactive smartphone- and tablet-based app that  empowers patients to test and monitor changes  in their vision. The app was designed for people  with diseases that affect the macula, such as  age-related macular degeneration and diabetes.  More than 350 Moorfields patients have used the  app, with  $70\\%$   claiming it offers them peace of  "}

Six years ago,\nMary was diagnosed with invasive, ductal grade 2,\nHER2-negative and ER-positive breast cancer.\n\nWhen she received her diagnosis, her first thoughts\nwere for her young family. “I was more scared\nabout telling my family and the impact it would\nhave on my daughters,” Mary says. “It was there\nand then that | knew | was going to fight this. |\n\nwas determined to see their communions and\nconfirmations and hear about their first boyfriend\nor girlfriend.”\n\nMary lives in County Dublin, Ireland, and is\ncurrently on sick leave from her role as an Internal\nCommunications Manager at Roche Ireland. She\nfirmly believes that the reason she has been able\nto progress so far is a friend’s suggestion that\nshe look into genomic profiling,\n\nGenomic profiling helps doctors tailor treatment\n\nto a patient’s unique tumour based on its individual\n‘fingerprint’. The process can detect, from a tissue\nor blood sample, mutations in a cancer’s DNA\n\nwhich may be driving its growth and identify specific\ntreatments which can target that individual tumour.\nThis allows doctors to refine and tailor treatment\nbased on the mutation rather than the location of\nthe cancer in the body.\n\nAfter a round of successful treatment, Mary was\ngiven the all-clear. But, just two years later, her\n\ncancer returned. Again, treatment was a success,\n\nand again she was given the all-clear. But just\nmonths later, she discovered a lump in her neck\nand her worst fears were confirmed - the cancer\nhad returned once more.\n\nMary had an added complication: each time\n\nher cancer returned, it evolved.

Six years ago,  Mary was diagnosed with invasive, ductal grade 2,  HER2-negative and ER-positive breast cancer. \nWhen she received her diagnosis, her first thoughts  were for her young family. “I was more scared  about telling my family and the impact it would  have on my daughters,” Mary says. “It was there  and then that I knew I was going to fight this. I  was determined to see their communions and  confirmations and hear about their first boyfriend  or girlfriend.” \nMary lives in County Dublin, Ireland, and is  currently on sick leave from her role as an Internal  Communications Manager at Roche Ireland. She  firmly believes that the reason she has been able  to progress so far is a friend’s suggestion that  she look into genomic profiling,  \nGenomic profiling helps doctors tailor treatment  to a patient’s unique tumour based on its individual  ‘fingerprint’. The process can detect, from a tissue  or blood sample, mutations in a cancer’s DNA  which may be driving its growth and identify specific  treatments which can target that individual tumour.  This allows doctors to refine and tailor treatment  based on the mutation rather than the location of  the cancer in the body.  \nAfter a round of successful treatment, Mary was  given the all-clear. But, just two years later, her  cancer returned. Again, treatment was a success,  and again she was given the all-clear. But just  months later, she discovered a lump in her neck  and her worst fears were confirmed – the cancer  had returned once more. \n\nMary had an added complication: each time  her cancer returned, it evolved. It began as  HER2-negative and ER-positive breast cancer,  then recurred as HER2-positive and ER-negative,  and finally as triple negative. Thankfully, genomic  testing was able to provide treatment options  that could work well with Mary’s tumour.  \n“I’ve gone down several different treatment  paths and they’ve kept me alive for six and a  half years,” she says. “Genomic testing is a huge  part of that. The current treatment is working  well and all my cancer tumours are stable at  the moment.”  \nAs Roche celebrates its 125-year anniversary,  Mary says: “It’s my hope that over the next  125 years, Roche’s fantastic people will have  created and rolled out a medicine that can cure  all forms of breast cancer. And, I also hope a  bulletproof method for preventing breast cancer  will have been created, which could be implanted  into all women from the age of 40.”  \n“For now, their incredible work has given me  precious extra time which I am so grateful for  and I can still kiss my two girls goodnight every  evening.” "}

Barell, CEO of Roche from 1920  until 1953, recognised when he brought her into the company. He had a  feeling for brilliant people and did not care much for the convention of  the times. Whether man or woman, it did not matter. He was a champion  of excellence in any form. \nIn 1926, he posted Alice to a position in Japan. After a 35-day journey  by boat, she arrived in Tokyo to handle the country’s product launches  and correspondence with Basel. Alice loved Japan and, unsurprisingly,  excelled at the role. Within three years, she was promoted to Director  of Roche Japan, making her the first woman senior executive at Roche.  It was a sensational development at the time. \nWomen like Alice paved the way for the inclusion of people with diverse  backgrounds, experiences, skills and perspectives, which is key to our  success today, and in the future. \nIn 2021, we increased the use of technology and digitalisation and  introduced a number of new approaches and tools to provide our  people with around-the-clock support. \nOur rapidly changing environment is prompting  us to think differently about how to sustain our  competitiveness.

Expert teams, with a problem-to- solution-focused mindset, have been addressing this global issue for more  than 15 years. Most greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at Roche originate  from the transformation and use of energy. Instead of compensating with  offsets, the teams pursue programmes that actively reduce GHG emissions.  As a priority these include reducing energy consumption and increasing  energy efficiency before substituting with energy from sustainable  sources. With these measures, we have already reduced GHG emissions by  more than 59% since 2004. At the Basel and Kaiseraugst site, for example,  the energy consumption of the buildings and operations is minimised by  innovative design and they are heated with waste heat and heat from the  environment in a carbon dioxide-neutral way. We will continue to optimise  energy use throughout the company striving towards one of our goals of  reducing scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions to zero by 2050. "}
