{"layout": 420, "type": "text", "text": "Extended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing. Beginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market  practices, the Company began a program to negotiate  extended payment terms with its suppliers.  At the same  time, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance  program (the \"SCF\") with a number of global financial  institutions (the \"SCF Banks\").  Under the SCF, qualifying  suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the  Company to a SCF Bank.  These participating suppliers  negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with  the respective SCF Bank.  While the Company is not party to  those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating  suppliers to utilize the Company’s credit worthiness in  establishing credit spreads and associated costs.  This  generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms  than they would be able to secure on their own.  The  Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision  to sell a receivable.  Once a qualifying supplier elects to  participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF  Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they  sell to the SCF bank.  However, all the Company’s payments  to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the  invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual  invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank.  The SCF  Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any  invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank  under the SCF.

Accordingly, our average days  outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of  suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF.   In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers,  where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of  goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying  costs are largely included in SG&A.
