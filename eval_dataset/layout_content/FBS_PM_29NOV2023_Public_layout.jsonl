The Bureau will continue working on  advancing DEIA initiatives for its workforce in alignment with its DEIA Operational Plan  and make updates to the Plan as needed. It will build a more effective, accountable,  resilient, and data-literate team, equipped with the necessary tools, data, IT, and  infrastructure to perform mission-critical work and meet the challenges of the next  decade. PM will adapt to the changing nature of the post-pandemic environment by  continuing to leverage workplace flexibilities, hybrid/remote work, and IT  modernization. Through the Strategic Impact Assessment Framework (SIAF) team, the  Bureau will prioritize efforts to improve knowledge management; data quality,  centralization, storage, and access; and facilitate self-service retrieval of high-quality,  cleared data for analysis and evaluation. PM will also establish and enforce Bureau-level  data governance policies and build upon the pilot Security Cooperation Evaluation  Framework (SCEF), a Bureau-wide diagnostic tool to assess the strength of partners’  security sectors and PM’s contributions to policy outcomes.
