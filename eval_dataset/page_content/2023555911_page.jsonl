Genocide is explicitly listed as one of the offenses to which the framework\napplies. To make the determination that genocide has taken place, the law provides that\n“regard should be had to customary international law and widely accepted instruments\nof international law. . . .” Proposals for inclusion in the sanctions list may be submitted\nby the EU Member States and the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs\nand Security Policy to the Council of the European Union (Council).

Introduction\n\nOn December 7, 2020, the European Union (EU) enacted its Global Human Rights Sanctions\nRegime, also referred to as the “European Magnitsky Act,”! to hold perpetrators of serious\nhuman rights violations and abuses accountable.

Genocide is\nexplicitly listed as one of the offenses to which the framework applies.?

Introduction  \nOn December 7, 2020, the European Union (EU) enacted its Global Human Rights Sanctions  Regime, also referred to as the “European Magnitsky   $\\mathsf{A c t},^{\\prime\\prime}{}^{1}$   to hold perpetrators of serious  human rights violations and abuses accountable. It consists of two acts, Council Regulation  (EU) 2020/1998 (Regulation) and Council Decision (CFSP) 2020/1999 (Decision).  Genocide is  explicitly listed as one of the offenses to which the framework applies.  The sanctions regime  enables the EU to implement targeted restrictive measures no matter who is responsible for the  respective infringements or where they occur. The EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime  is in addition to the existing geographic sanctions regimes that address human rights violations  and abuses.  "}
