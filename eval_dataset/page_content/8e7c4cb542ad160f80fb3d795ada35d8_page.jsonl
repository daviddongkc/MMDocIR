Since 1961, there have  been several amendments to the Resolution  as well as some more ambitious attempts to  rewrite and update it to address this concern.  The most recent such attempt was the Unified  Bulk Program proposed by the New York City  Department of City Planning (DCP) 2  in 1999.  It proposed a rewrite that would require new  development to be more consistent with  existing neighborhood characteristics, but it  faced significant opposition from real estate  developers and was never adopted.  \nSince Mayor Bloomberg took office in  2002, the City has eschewed a comprehen- sive rewrite of the Resolution and focused  instead on using its existing powers to ini- tiate neighborhood rezonings.

Most\nof the lots rezoned between 2003 and\n2007 fall into this category (particularly in\nStaten Island and Queens).\n\nOur estimates of residential development\ncapacity are based on the maximum FAR\nthat the Zoning Resolution assigns to dif-\nferent lots. But the Zoning Resolution\ntegulates development in a number of\nother ways as well, through height limits,\nfront, side and rear yard requirements, lot\ncoverage limits and minimum off-street\nparking requirements, for example. FAR\nlimits the total size of a new building, but\nthese other regulations help determine its\nshape and placement on its site. If a zon-\ning change doesn’t alter a lot’s maximum\nFAR, it is likely changing some of these\nother types of regulations. We call these\nzoning changes “contextual-only” because\nthese kinds of changes are usually enacted\nto ensure that new development more\nclosely matches the existing context of a\nneighborhood.’ DCP’s strategic plan iden-\ntifies “protecting neighborhood character”\nas one of its key goals; contextual-only\ntezonings can be thought of as respond-\ning to that goal.\n\n1 Zoning changes that increase or decrease a lot’s\nmaximum FAR also may impose regulations intended to\nensure that new development is sensitive to neighbor-\nhood context, but because the lot’s residential develop-\nment capacity changed, we classify these as upzonings or\ndownzonings.\n\nFor example, the 2005 City-initiated rezon-\ning of Cambria Heights in eastern Queens\nplaced hundreds of mostly single-family\nhomes into new zoning districts. While\nthe maximum FAR remained the same,\nthe rezoning imposed deeper front yard\nrequirements, reduced the maximum\nheight of the front-facing wall of homes,\nand capped total building height.\n\nOther “contextual-only” zoning changes\nrestrict the building types that can be\ndeveloped, even if the resulting density\nis no different. As part of the 2007 Dyker\nHeights rezoning in southwestern Brook-\nlyn, for example, several blocks were\nrezoned to permit only detached and\nsemi-detached homes, the predominant\nexisting building types on the blocks.\nWhile in most cases the new zoning didn’t\nexplicitly change the amount of residen-\ntial capacity, by restricting new buildings\nto detached and semi-detached homes, it\nbarred the construction of row houses and\napartment buildings, both of which were\npreviously permitted.\n\nIn some cases, the changes that result from\na “contextual-only” zoning likely have a\npractical impact on development capacity\nthat we currently are unable to measure\nbecause we focus only on maximum FAR.\nThe combined impacts of height limits\nand required yard dimensions, for exam-\nple, could make it practically impossible\nto develop some lots to their full FAR.

There are three main buildings visible: the one on the left has a modern design with large glass windows and an exterior staircase; the middle building has a more traditional design with a stoop; and the building on the right is similar in style but appears to be slightly older. There are trees with yellow leaves lining the street, and a person walking on the sidewalk."}

As discussed above, many\ncritics of the Zoning Resolution claim that it\npays insufficient attention to neighborhood\ncontext; downzonings are seen as a way to\namend the Resolution at a neighborhood\n\nlevel to ensure that new development will\nnot be at a scale much larger than the exist-\ning context. Limiting future development\ncan be seen as a benefit because it preserves\nthe existing character of the neighborhood,\nand prevents new uses that may be unde-\nsirable or tax a neighborhood's existing\ninfrastructure.

The  implications of this finding are mixed. On  the one hand, it might show that upzonings  are not particularly targeted to areas seeing  unusual population growth. On the other  hand, given that the upzoned lots weren’t  particularly concentrated in high growth  areas, it may suggest that many upzoned  areas were appropriate targets for the City’s  economic development initiatives. Ulti- mately, it is unclear whether rezonings are  driving or responding to growth. \nNext, we look at house price apprecia- tion between 1998 and 2003 in the com- munity districts where rezoned lots were  located. As Table F shows, upzoned lots  were located 7  in areas with slightly stronger  house price appreciation than the City as a  whole, but there was not a great deal of dif- ference between areas containing upzoned,  downzoned or contextual-only rezoned lots.  Again, the lack of variation between the lots  upzoned, downzoned or contextual-only  rezoned makes the implications ambiguous.  It indicates that unusually rapid price appre- ciation isn’t signaling consumer demand for  the upzoned areas, but nor are those areas  lagging so far behind that the upzoning can  be explained by an unusual need for eco- nomic development.  \n\nFinally, we look at demand by examining the  rate of new construction in the community  districts where rezoned lots were located.  Specifically, we look at the number of certifi- cates of occupancy—the final permit issued  by the City before a residential building can  be occupied—issued between 1998 and  2003.  As Table G reveals, upzoned lots were  located in areas that had about the same level  of development as the City during that time  (as measured by the number of certificates  of occupancy issued). Downzoned lots were  in areas that saw significantly less building  activity, while contextual-only rezoned lots  were in areas that had much higher rates of  development than the City median. These  findings have several important implica- tions. The fact the upzonings took place in  areas with average levels of development  may signal that the upzonings will have to  lead, rather than follow, the market. It may  be appropriate for upzonings to try to chan- nel growth into areas where the market has  not yet signaled interest if, for example, the  City believes infrastructure in those areas is  underused, or if the City plans to upgrade  infrastructure it believes was holding devel- opment back. On the other hand, it could  be that the average development patterns in  the areas with upzoned lots signals that the  market isn’t interested in the area for reasons  that City initiatives won’t cure.

There are a lot of thought-provoking\nfindings here, but in many ways, these find-\nings raise more questions than they answer.\nWith the foundation we’ve now built, the\nFurman Center is studying several ques-\n\ntions we think are important to explore.\n\nThe impact of rezonings\n\nEarlier we discussed the potential benefits\nand burdens that upzonings and downzon-\nings present for communities, but there is\nlittle empirical work examining how rezon-\nings actually affect a neighborhood. With\nthe data we’ve compiled about the zoning\nchanges, coupled with the rich data the Fur-\nman Center has on New York City’s housing\nand neighborhoods, we now have a unique\nopportunity to track impacts over time. We\nwill examine such questions as: What effects\ndo the rezonings have on the amount and\ntype of development activity? How do the\nrezonings affect property values? Are rezon-\nings followed by changes in the demograph-\nics or other characteristics of the neighbor-\nhood? We are particularly interested in the\neffects contextual rezonings will have on\nthe amount, type, and price of new hous-\ning in the neighborhood, and in the effects\nsuch rezonings will have on the condition\nand price of existing housing.\n\nAdditional measures of\n\ninfrastructure capacity\n\nThe research we report here begins to\nexplore whether new capacity is being added\nin areas that have the infrastructure to sup-\nport growth (and whether capacity is being\nreduced in areas that had infrastructure\n\nthat could handle additional growth). We\nstarted this investigation by looking at\naccess to transit, but transit is only one of\nthe many types of infrastructure needed to\nsupport residential development.

There are a lot of thought-provoking  findings here, but in many ways, these find- ings raise more questions than they answer.  With the foundation we’ve now built, the  Furman Center is studying several ques- tions we think are important to explore.  \nThe impact of rezonings \nEarlier we discussed the potential benefits  and burdens that upzonings and downzon- ings present for communities, but there is  little empirical work examining how rezon- ings actually affect a neighborhood. With  the data we’ve compiled about the zoning  changes, coupled with the rich data the Fur- man Center has on New York City’s housing  and neighborhoods, we now have a unique  opportunity to track impacts over time. We  will examine such questions as: What effects  do the rezonings have on the amount and  type of development activity? How do the  rezonings affect property values? Are rezon- ings followed by changes in the demograph- ics or other characteristics of the neighbor- hood? We are particularly interested in the  effects contextual rezonings will have on  the amount, type, and price of new hous- ing in the neighborhood, and in the effects  such rezonings will have on the condition  and price of existing housing.  \nAdditional measures of   infrastructure capacity \nThe research we report here begins to  explore whether new capacity is being added  in areas that have the infrastructure to sup- port growth (and whether capacity is being  reduced in areas that had infrastructure  that could handle additional growth). We  started this investigation by looking at  access to transit, but transit is only one of  the many types of infrastructure needed to  support residential development. In future  work, we will explore the relationship of  rezonings to other critical infrastructure  assets such as parks, school capacity and  quality, and sewer capacity. We also plan  to build on this analysis of transit access  by looking not just at proximity, but also at  the capacity of lines serving these neighbor- hoods, and to expand the analysis to include  express buses. \n\nThe interplay between rezonings   and parking requirements \nSome of the contextual-only rezonings add  requirements for parking that effectively  reduce the potential for new development.  To better understand the interplay between  minimum parking requirements and hous- ing capacity in the City, the Furman Center is  investigating the impact such requirements  may have on the City’s ability to accommo- date new growth and on its ability to reduce  pollution and other problems created by  auto use.  \nThe role of political and   community participation  \nObviously, the Department of City Plan- ning and the City Planning Commission  are not alone in thinking about how land  within the City should be used. The rezon- ing process involves community boards,  Borough Presidents, the City Council and  a wide variety of community and industry  groups. To better understand the process,  we need a better empirical basis for assess- ing the relationship between political activ- ity and other forms of participation, and  rezoning outcomes. That assessment also  may provide guidance about how the rezon- ing process can be improved to ensure that  the benefits and burdens of growth are  fairly distributed.  "}
