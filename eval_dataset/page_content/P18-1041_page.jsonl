By rep- resenting each word as a ﬁxed-length vector, these embeddings can group semantically simi- lar words, while implicitly encoding rich linguis- tic regularities and patterns ( Bengio et al. ,  2003 ; Mikolov et al. ,  2013 ;  Pennington et al. ,  2014 ). \nLeveraging the word-embedding construct, many deep architectures have been proposed to model the  compositional it y  in variable-length text se- quences. These methods range from simple op- erations like addition ( Mitchell and Lapata ,  2010 ; Iyyer et al. ,  2015 ), to more sophisticated compo- sitional functions such as Recurrent Neural Net- works (RNNs) ( Tai et al. ,  2015 ;  Sutskever et al. , 2014 ), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) ( Kalchbrenner et al. ,  2014 ;  Kim ,  2014 ;  Zhang et al. ,  2017a ) and Recursive Neural Networks ( Socher et al. ,  2011a ). \nModels with more expressive compositional functions,  e.g. , RNNs or CNNs, have demon- strated impressive results; however, they are typ- ically computationally expensive, due to the need to estimate hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of parameters ( Parikh et al. ,  2016 ). In contrast, models with simple compositional functions often compute a sentence or document embedding by simply adding, or averaging, over the word em- bedding of each sequence element obtained via, e.g. ,  word2vec  ( Mikolov et al. ,  2013 ), or  GloVe ( Pennington et al. ,  2014 ). Generally, such a Sim- ple Word-Embedding-based Model (SWEM) does not explicitly account for spatial, word-order in- formation within a text sequence. However, they possess the desirable property of having signif- icantly fewer parameters, enjoying much faster training, relative to RNN- or CNN-based models. Hence, there is a computation- vs. -expressiveness tradeoff regarding how to model the composition- ality of a text sequence. \nIn this paper, we conduct an extensive experi- mental investigation to understand when, and why, simple pooling strategies, operated over word em- beddings alone, already carry sufﬁcient informa- tion for natural language understanding. To ac- count for the distinct nature of various NLP tasks that may require different semantic features, we compare SWEM-based models with existing re- current and convolutional networks in a point- by-point manner. Speciﬁcally, we consider 17 datasets, including three distinct NLP tasks:  doc- ument classiﬁcation  (Yahoo news, Yelp reviews, etc .),  natural language sequence matching  (SNLI, WikiQA,  etc .) and  (short) sentence classiﬁca- tion/tagging  (Stanford sentiment treebank, TREC, etc .). Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable or even superior performance in the majority of cases considered. "}

Intuitively,    $z$   takes the information of every se- quence element into account via the addition op- eration. \nMax Pooling Motivated by the observation that, in general, only a small number of key words con- tribute to ﬁnal predictions, we propose another SWEM variant, that extracts the most salient fea- tures from every word-embedding dimension, by taking the maximum value along each dimension of the word vectors.

So motivated, we\nfurther propose a hierarchical pooling layer. Let\nViitn—1 Tefer to the local window consisting of\nn consecutive words words, vj, Viti, ..-,Vitn—1-\nFirst, an average-pooling is performed on each\nlocal window, vj:i:n—1. The extracted features\nfrom all windows are further down-sampled with\na global max-pooling operation on top of the rep-\nresentations for every window. We call this ap-\nproach SWEM-hier due to its layered pooling.\nThis strategy preserves the local spatial infor-\nmation of a text sequence in the sense that it keeps\ntrack of how the sentence/document is constructed\nfrom individual word windows, i.e., n-grams. This\nformulation is related to bag-of-n-grams method\n(Zhang et al., 2015b). However, SWEM-hier\nlearns fixed-length representations for the n-grams\nthat appear in the corpus, rather than just capturing\ntheir occurrences via count features, which may\npotentially advantageous for prediction purposes.\n\n3.4 Parameters & Computation Comparison\nWe compare CNN, LSTM and SWEM wrt their\nparameters and computational speed. A denotes\nthe dimension of word embeddings, as above. For\nthe CNN, we use n to denote the filter width (as-\nsumed constant for all filters, for simplicity of\nanalysis, but in practice variable n is commonly\nused). We define d as the dimension of the final\nsequence representation. Specifically, d represents\nthe dimension of hidden units or the number of fil-\nters in LSTM or CNN, respectively.\n\nWe first examine the number of compositional\nparameters for each model. As shown in Table 1,\nboth the CNN and LSTM have a large number of\nparameters, to model the semantic compositional-\nity of text sequences, whereas SWEM has no such\n\n443\n\nparameters. Similar to Vaswani et al. (2017), we\nhen consider the computational complexity and\nhe minimum number of sequential operations re-\nquired for each model. SWEM tends to be more\nefficient than CNN and LSTM in terms of compu-\nation complexity. For example, considering the\ncase where kK = d, SWEM is faster than CNN or\nLSTM by a factor of nd or d, respectively. Further,\nhe computations in SWEM are highly paralleliz-\nable, unlike LSTM that requires O(L) sequential\nsteps.\n\n4 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate different compositional functions on\na wide variety of supervised tasks, including\ndocument categorization, text sequence matching\n(given a sentence pair, X,, X2, predict their re-\nlationship, y) as well as (short) sentence classifi-\ncation. We experiment on 17 datasets concerning\nnatural language understanding, with correspond-\ning data statistics summarized in the Supplemen-\ntary Material. Our code will be released to encour-\nage future research.\n\nWe use GloVe word embeddings with kK = 300\n(Pennington et al., 2014) as initialization for all\nour models. Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words are\ninitialized from a uniform distribution with range\n[-0.01, 0.01]. The GloVe embeddings are em-\nployed in two ways to learn refined word em-\nbeddings: (i) directly updating each word em-\nbedding during training; and (ii) training a 300-\ndimensional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layer\nwith ReLU activation, with GloVe embeddings as\ninput to the MLP and with output defining the re-\nfined word embeddings.

The final classifier is\nimplemented as an MLP layer with dimension se-\nlected from the set [100, 300, 500, 1000}, followed\nby a sigmoid or softmax function, depending on\nhe specific task.\n\nAdam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is used to opti-\nmize all models, with learning rate selected from\nhe set [1 x 1073,3 x 1074,2 x 1074,1 x 1079]\n(with cross-validation used to select the appro-\npriate parameter for a given dataset and task).\nDropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014) is\n\n", "vlm_text": "The table compares three different models—CNN, LSTM, and SWEM—based on their parameters, complexity, and sequential operations:\n\n1. **CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)**:\n   - **Parameters**: Proportional to \\( n \\cdot K \\cdot d \\), where \\( n \\), \\( K \\), and \\( d \\) likely represent the number of layers, filters, and dimensions, respectively.\n   - **Complexity**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(n \\cdot L \\cdot K \\cdot d) \\), where \\( L \\) could represent the sequence length.\n   - **Sequential Ops**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(1) \\), indicating that the operations can be done in parallel without dependency on previous steps.\n\n2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:\n   - **Parameters**: \\( 4 \\cdot d \\cdot (K + d) \\), implicating multiple weight matrices due to gates and cell states in LSTM.\n   - **Complexity**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot d^2 + L \\cdot K \\cdot d) \\), reflecting the sequence-dependent nature of computation.\n   - **Sequential Ops**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(L) \\), indicative of sequential processing tied to the sequence length.\n\n3. **SWEM (Simple Word-Embedding Model)**:\n   - **Parameters**: 0, suggesting that it does not have learning parameters like neural network weights.\n   - **Complexity**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(L \\cdot K) \\), possibly simpler than the others due to its structure.\n   - **Sequential Ops**: \\( \\mathcal{O}(1) \\), indicating parallelizable operations similar to CNN.\n\nOverall, the table highlights differences in architectural overhead and operational characteristics of the three models, especially focusing on their efficiency and resource requirements.\nTable 1: Comparisons of CNN, LSTM and SWEM architectures. Columns correspond to the number of  compositional  parameters, computational com- plexity and sequential operations, respectively. \nlearned. As a result, the models only exploit intrin- sic word embedding information for predictions. \nHierarchical Pooling Both SWEM- aver  and SWEM- max  do not take word-order or spatial in- formation into consideration, which could be use- ful for certain NLP applications. So motivated, we further propose a  hierarchical  pooling layer. Let  $v_{i:i+n-1}$   refer to the  local  window consisting of  $n$   consecutive words words,    $v_{i},v_{i+1},...,v_{i+n-1}$  . First, an average-pooling is performed on each local window,    $v_{i:i+n-1}$  . The extracted features from all windows are further down-sampled with a  global  max-pooling operation on top of the rep- resentations for every window. We call this ap- proach SWEM- hier  due to its layered pooling. \nThis strategy preserves the local spatial infor- mation of a text sequence in the sense that it keeps track of how the sentence/document is constructed from individual word windows,  i.e. ,    $n$  -grams. This formulation is related to bag-of-  $\\cdot n$  -grams method ( Zhang et al. ,  2015b ). However, SWEM- hier learns ﬁxed-length representations for the  $n$  -grams that appear in the corpus, rather than just capturing their occurrences via count features, which may potentially advantageous for prediction purposes. \n3.4 Parameters & Computation Comparison We compare CNN, LSTM and SWEM wrt their parameters and computational speed.    $K$   denotes the dimension of word embeddings, as above. For the CNN, we use    $n$   to denote the ﬁlter width (as- sumed constant for all ﬁlters, for simplicity of analysis, but in practice variable    $n$   is commonly used). We deﬁne    $d$   as the dimension of the ﬁnal sequence representation. Speciﬁcally,    $d$   represents the dimension of hidden units or the number of ﬁl- ters in LSTM or CNN, respectively. \nWe ﬁrst examine the number of  compositional parameters  for each model. As shown in Table  1 , both the CNN and LSTM have a large number of parameters, to model the semantic compositional- ity of text sequences, whereas SWEM has no such parameters. Similar to  Vaswani et al.  ( 2017 ), we then consider the computational complexity and the minimum number of sequential operations re- quired for each model. SWEM tends to be more efﬁcient than CNN and LSTM in terms of compu- tation complexity. For example, considering the case where    $K=d$  , SWEM is faster than CNN or LSTM by a factor of  $^{n d}$   or    $d$  , respectively. Further, the computations in SWEM are highly paralleliz- able, unlike LSTM that requires    $\\mathcal{O}(L)$   sequential steps. \n\n4 Experiments \nWe evaluate different compositional functions on a wide variety of supervised tasks, including document categorization, text sequence matching (given a sentence pair,    $X_{1},\\;X_{2}$  , predict their re- lationship,    $y$  ) as well as (short) sentence classiﬁ- cation. We experiment on 17 datasets concerning natural language understanding, with correspond- ing data statistics summarized in the Supplemen- tary Material. Our code will be released to encour- age future research. \nWe use GloVe word embeddings with  $K=300$  ( Pennington et al. ,  2014 ) as initialization for all our models. Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words are initialized from a uniform distribution with range  $[-0.01,0.01]$  . The GloVe embeddings are em- ployed in two ways to learn reﬁned word em- beddings:   $(i)$   directly updating each word em- bedding during training; and   $(i i)$   training a 300- dimensional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layer with ReLU activation, with GloVe embeddings as input to the MLP and with output deﬁning the re- ﬁned word embeddings. The latter approach cor- responds to learning an MLP model that adapts GloVe embeddings to the dataset and task of in- terest. The advantages of these two methods dif- fer from dataset to dataset. We choose the bet- ter strategy based on their corresponding perfor- mances on the validation set. The ﬁnal classiﬁer is implemented as an MLP layer with dimension se- lected from the set  [100 ,  300 ,  500 ,  1000] , followed by a sigmoid or softmax function, depending on the speciﬁc task. \nAdam ( Kingma and Ba ,  2014 ) is used to opti- mize all models, with learning rate selected from the set    $[1\\times10^{-3},3\\times10^{-4},\\bar{2}\\times10^{-4},1\\times10^{-5}]$  (with cross-validation used to select the appro- priate parameter for a given dataset and task).

The GloVe embeddings are represented in light blue, and the SWEM-max embeddings are represented in light red. The x-axis represents the embedding amplitude, ranging from -1.5 to 1.5, while the y-axis represents the frequency of the embeddings, scaled up to 1.2e7. From the histogram, it appears that the SWEM-max embeddings have a strong peak centered around 0, indicating that most of its embedding values are close to zero, whereas the GloVe embeddings have a more spread distribution of values away from zero.\nIn this regard, the nature of max-pooling pro- cess gives rise to a more interpretable model. For a document, only the word with largest value in each embedding dimension is employed for the ﬁ- nal representation. Thus, we suspect that semanti- cally similar words may have large values in some shared dimensions. So motivated, after training the SWEM- max  model on the Yahoo dataset, we selected ﬁve words with the largest values, among the entire vocabulary, for each word embedding dimension (these words are selected preferentially in the corresponding dimension, by the max op- eration).

The tasks include SNLI (Stanford Natural Language Inference), MultiNLI (Matched and Mismatched), WikiQA, Quora question pair classification, and MSRP (Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus). The models evaluated are CNN, LSTM, and three variations of SWEM (Simple Word-embedding based Models): SWEM-aver, SWEM-max, and SWEM-concat. For each model, the table reports accuracy (Acc.) for SNLI, MultiNLI, Quora, and MSRP; Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for WikiQA; and both accuracy (Acc.) and F1 score for MSRP. The highest scores in each column are marked in bold.\nTable 5: Performance of different models on matching natural language sentences. Results with   ⇤ are for Bidirectional LSTM, reported in  Williams et al.  ( 2017 ). Our reported results on MultiNLI are only trained MultiNLI training set (without training data from SNLI).

From this perspective, word-order informa- tion becomes much less useful for predicting rela- tionship between sentences. Moreover, consider- ing the simpler model architecture of SWEM, they could be much easier to be optimized than LSTM or CNN-based models, and thus give rise to better empirical results. \n4.2.1 Importance of word-order information \nOne possible disadvantage of SWEM is that it ig- nores the word-order information within a text se- quence, which could be potentially captured by CNN- or LSTM-based models. However, we em- pirically found that except for sentiment analysis, SWEM exhibits similar or even superior perfor- mance as the CNN or LSTM on a variety of tasks. In this regard, one natural question would be: how important are word-order features for these tasks? To this end, we randomly shufﬂe the words for every sentence in the training set, while keeping the original word order for samples in the test set. The motivation here is to remove the word-order features from the training set and examine how sensitive the performance on different tasks are to word-order information. We use LSTM as the model for this purpose since it can captures word- order information from the original training set. \nThe table presents a comparison of performance metrics (possibly accuracy percentages) across three datasets: Yahoo, Yelp P., and SNLI. The table is divided into two rows for each dataset, labeled as \"Original\" and \"Shuffled,\" representing two different conditions or configurations under which the datasets were used.\n\n- For the Yahoo dataset, the Original condition shows a value of 72.78, and the Shuffled condition shows a value of 72.89.\n- For the Yelp P. dataset, the Original condition shows a value of 95.11, and the Shuffled condition shows a value of 93.49.\n- For the SNLI dataset, the Original condition shows a value of 78.02, and the Shuffled condition shows a value of 77.68.\n\nThe table suggests that the shuffled versions of the datasets result in slightly different performance metrics compared to the original versions.\nTable 6: Test accuracy for LSTM model trained on original/shufﬂed training set. \nThe results on three distinct tasks are shown in Table  6 . Somewhat surprisingly, for Yahoo and SNLI datasets, the LSTM model trained on shuf- ﬂed training set shows comparable accuracies to those trained on the original dataset, indicating \nThe table presents two reviews or comments categorized as \"Negative\" and \"Positive.\" \n\n- **Negative:** The comment highlights friendly staff and a nice selection of vegetarian options. However, it also states that the food is \"just okay, not great\" and wonders why people like the food so much. The part \"is just okay, not great.

The subspace training yields similar ac- curacy with direct training for very small    $d$  , even when model parameters are not trained at all (  $\\mathit{(d=}$  0 ). This is because the word embeddings have the full degrees of freedom to adjust to achieve good solutions, regardless of the employed mod- els.

The results on testing datasets of AG News and Yelp P. are shown in Figure  2  (c)(d), respectively. SWEM shows signiﬁcantly higher accuracy than CNN for a large range of low sub- space dimension, indicating that SWEM is more parameter-efﬁcient to get a decent solution. In Figure  2 (c), if we set the performance threshold as   $80\\%$   testing accuracy, SWEM exhibits a lower  $d_{\\mathrm{int}}$   than CNN on AG News dataset. However, in Figure  2 (d), CNN can leverage more trainable parameters to achieve higher accuracy when    $d$   is large. \n5.2 Linear classiﬁers \nTo further investigate the quality of representa- tions learned from SWEMs, we employ a linear classiﬁer on top of the representations for pre- diction, instead of a non-linear MLP layer as in the previous section. It turned out that utiliz- ing a linear classiﬁer only leads to a very small performance drop for both Yahoo! Ans. (from\n\n  $73.53\\%$   to    $73.18\\%$  ) and Yelp P. datasets (from\n\n  $93.76\\%$   to    $93.66\\%$  ) . This observation highlights that SWEMs are able to extract robust and infor- mative sentence representations despite their sim- plicity. \n\n5.3 Extension to other languages \nWe have also tried our SWEM-concat and SWEM- hier models on Sogou news corpus (with the same experimental setup as ( Zhang et al. ,  2015b )), which is a  Chinese  dataset represented by Pinyin (a phonetic romanization of Chinese). SWEM- concat yields an accuracy of    $91.3\\%$  , while SWEM-hier (with a local window size of 5) ob- tains an accuracy of  $96.2\\%$   on the test set. Notably, the performance of SWEM-hier is comparable to the best accuracies of CNN   $(95.6\\%)$   and LSTM  $(95.2\\%)$  ), as reported in ( Zhang et al. ,  2015b ). This indicates that hierarchical pooling is more suitable than average/max pooling for Chinese text classiﬁ- cation, by taking spatial information into account. It also implies that Chinese is more sensitive to lo- cal word-order features than English. \n6 Conclusions \nWe have performed a comparative study between SWEM (with parameter-free pooling operations) and CNN or LSTM-based models, to represent text sequences on 17 NLP datasets. We further validated our experimental ﬁndings through ad- ditional exploration, and revealed some general rules for rationally selecting compositional func- tions for distinct problems. Our ﬁndings regard- ing when (and why) simple pooling operations are enough for text sequence representations are sum- marized as follows: \n•  Simple pooling operations are surprisingly ef- fective at representing longer documents (with hundreds of words), while recurrent/convolutional compositional functions are most effective when constructing representations for short sentences. •  Sentiment analysis tasks are more sensitive to word-order features than topic categorization tasks. However, a simple  hierarchical pooling layer  proposed here achieves comparable results to LSTM/CNN on sentiment analysis tasks.  $\\bullet$   To match natural language sentences,  e.g. , tex- tual entailment, answer sentence selection,  etc. , simple pooling operations already exhibit similar or even superior results, compared to CNN and LSTM. •  In SWEM with max-pooling operation, each  in- dividual dimension  of the word embeddings con- tains interpretable semantic patterns, and groups together words with a common theme or  topic .
