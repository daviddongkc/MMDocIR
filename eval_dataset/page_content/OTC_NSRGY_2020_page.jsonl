Ultimately, continuing to achieve  commercial and financial success is what will  allow us to finance this sustainability agenda.”  \nEnhancing our digital capabilities \nOur ongoing digital transformation was a powerful catalyst for consumer  engagement and growth in 2020. Our digital marketing and direct-to-consumer  business models enabled us to meet the sudden acceleration in demand for   online shopping. E-commerce sales grew by  $48.4\\%$   to account for  $12.8\\%$   of total  Group sales. \nAt the same time, our disciplined, forward-looking approach to digitalizing  our operations proved vital to increasing agility and flexibility. For example, we  accelerated the use of remote assistance and augmented reality technologies across  our production and R&D networks. These innovative technologies enabled our  experts to support critical activities such as the set-up of new production lines that  ensured on-time product launches. \nWe see enhancing digital capabilities as a key driver of our evolution. Across each  of our categories, we are developing digital ecosystems and partnering to unlock new  avenues for insight, innovation and sustainable, profitable growth. \nTaking a leadership role in sustainability \nConsumers rightfully expect companies, as well as individual brands and products,  to act as a force for good in full respect of human rights and the environment. We  are putting our resources and scale to work on being part of the development of the  countries and communities where we are present and on tackling issues such as  climate change, packaging waste and biodiversity. We believe in being transparent  about the challenges we face, the progress we are making and the trade-offs that we  have to manage over time.

On climate and biodiversity, we laid out  a detailed, time-bound climate change roadmap setting out our course to net zero  greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. We will transform the way we operate, exploring  new business models and addressing the biggest challenges in our food supply  chain. That includes advancing regenerative agriculture, scaling up our reforestation  program, making our products more sustainable, using more renewable energy and  reducing waste. "}

We work with retail partners,  influencers and platform providers to deepen our  understanding of consumers in each of our categories  through data. \nIncreasingly, our brands employ a data-driven,  audience-first approach to tailor messaging to their   consumers’ needs, while respecting privacy.

These campaigns are supported by an expanded  network of 30 category and market content studios  that efficiently deliver dynamic, high-quality  personalized content. \nTo take engagement to the next level, we have  begun the rollout of  always-on-analytics  to monitor  digital campaigns and enable our brands to adapt  messaging and design experiences based on real-time  signals.

We responded to COVID-19 based on three clear  priorities: Safeguarding people’s health, ensuring  business continuity and supporting communities. \nOur value creation model continued to balance  the pursuit of top-line and bottom-line growth with  capital efficiency. We bring relevance to consumers  through science- and consumer-driven innovation  and develop solutions to meet fast-changing  consumer needs. \nWe refreshed our company purpose statement  to reflect our strategy: We unlock the power of food  to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for  generations to come. \nWe continued to engage on environmental, social  and governance (ESG) issues which are material  to our business and impactful on society.
