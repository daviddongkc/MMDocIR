Prior to this, it appears  that charge bargaining occurred in an unregulated manner. Under the current  provisions, a defendant must submit a request for plea bargaining to the court using  the form provided in the Code. Following a brief court appearance, the prosecution  and defense can proceed to agree upon a satisfactory disposition of the case. This  can include plea bargaining of the charge or of the sentence. The court will then  consider the agreement and dispose of the case in accordance with the relevant  provision in the Code, which includes the ability to sentence the defendant to not  more than half of the maximum punishment of imprisonment for the offense. Such  a sentence is not available, however, where the case involves a sexually related  offense, an offense that is subject to life imprisonment, an offense committed against  a child under twelve years old, or where, in the case of a serious offense, the  defendant has had a previous conviction for a similar offense.  The 2010 provisions were intended to assist in addressing the backlog of cases before  Malaysian courts and to enhance the efficiency of the criminal justice system. In  addition to the amendments, the chief justice had previously instituted various judicial  reforms, including the introduction of automated case management and tracking  systems. In recent years, the court backlog has largely been eliminated. However, there  are no statistics or studies available that show how the plea bargaining provisions have  impacted this or improved efficiencies more broadly.

Article 681 of the Statute of Criminal  Procedure of 1864 established a possibility of summary proceedings as an alternative to full- fledged judicial hearings. These provisions were later replicated in the first Soviet Code of  Criminal Procedure of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) of 1922 and in its  later version of 1923.

The new Code of Criminal Procedure of the RSFSR adopted in 1960 did not envisage  a possibility of summary proceedings. However, despite the strong negative attitude toward the  idea of a “plot” between public authorities and the accused, sometimes plea bargaining  unofficially took place. Alexander Chashin, a Russian legal practitioner with many years of  experience, points out that it was often “initiated by investigators or prosecutors in the most  complicated criminal cases when they came to understanding that at some point they can suffer  total defeat from the defense attorney and his client or by defense attorneys, who realized that  their client has an ace up his sleeve, and this ace can be traded to the prosecutor for something,  which is not specified in the law, or by judges, who could easily understand these reasons and  take them into consideration.” 2  Chashin argues that there were unofficial cases of plea bargaining  in the Soviet Union. Usually, they came in the form of a verbal arrangement between the defense  attorney and the investigator on easing the restrictive pretrial conditions on the suspect in  exchange for information on the criminal case in question. Such “gentlemen’s agreements” were  most popular in criminal cases concerning the purchase of drugs for personal use.

Under Russian law, a defendant’s  express consent to the charges brought against him is a declarative statement. The special  procedure does not provide for any negotiations between the parties involving the judge where  some charges could be dropped.  If the state prosecutor or the victim (in a private prosecution  where the victim has submitted a complaint directly to the court and acts as a prosecutor) agree,  the defendant can give his consent to the charges and request sentencing without a trial.  Also,  the special   procedure defined in Chapter 40 of the CCP applies only to crimes punishable by  imprisonment not exceeding a 10-year term. The judgment rendered in the special procedure  cannot be appealed on the grounds of inconsistency between the findings of the court and the  merits of the case.
