The jurisdictions were selected on the basis of those identified as being either “full” (23) or  “flawed” (52) democracies in the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index 2020 report (excluding the United States).  The jurisdictions are listed in alphabetical order.   \nThe majority vote requirements are divided into three broad types:  \n• Majority of votes cast, reflecting what is frequently referred to as a “simple majority,” being a requirement that at least half plus one (or “more than half”) of the votes cast be in favor of the passage of a legislative proposal (sometimes also referred to as a majority of the “members present” or those “present and voting”). Some jurisdictions may refer to, for example, “an absolute majority of members present.” • Majority of all members, being at least half plus one of the total number of members of the legislature or a particular chamber or house of the legislative body, whether present or not. The term “absolute majority” is sometimes used to refer to this type of majority. • Supermajority requirements, being requirements for more than an absolute or simple majority of votes or members. This is also sometimes referred to as a “qualified majority” or a “special majority.” \nThe table does not generally reflect matters such as quorum requirements or other structural or procedural arrangements that  may impact on the passage of legislation; requirements for work of legislative committees; or voting requirements for the  adoption of non-legislative matters such as confirmation of government appointees, motions of no confidence, and the like.  Furthermore, with respect to constitutional amendments, while voting requirements in the legislature are included, countries  often require various additional procedures that are not reflected in the table.  \nThe table provides information on the voting requirements in Albania's legislative process. It includes the following columns:\n\n1. **Country**: The name of the country, which is Albania in this table.\n2. **Majority of Votes Cast**: Indicates whether a simple majority of votes cast is required. For Albania, this is marked as \"No.\"\n3. **Majority of All Members**: Indicates whether a majority of all members is required. For Albania, this is \"Yes.\"\n4. **Supermajority Requirements**: Describes specific scenarios requiring a supermajority. In Albania, a three-fifths majority of members is needed for laws on elections, citizenship, public functions, and major codes.\n5. **Citation**: Provides a reference to the legal source of this information. In this case, it cites the Constitution of the Republic of Albania, articles 78 and 81, with a URL link for further details: https://perma.cc/C7BU-28RR."}
