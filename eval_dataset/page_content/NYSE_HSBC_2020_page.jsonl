The background appears to be blurred, likely a pale blue or gray backdrop that provides contrast to the subject's attire.\nIn 2020, we experienced economic and  social upheaval on a scale unseen in  living memory. Even before the year  began, the external environment was  being reshaped by a range of factors  – including the impact of trade tensions  between the US and China, Brexit, low  interest rates and rapid technological  development. The spread of the Covid-19  virus made that environment all the more  complex and challenging. \nMark E Tucker Group Chairman \nThe Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted  our customers, our colleagues, our  shareholders and the communities we serve.  The first priority was, and remains, dealing  with the public health crisis, but the economic  crisis that unfolded simultaneously has also  been unprecedented in recent times. The  financial services industry has been at the  forefront of helping businesses and individuals  through the difficulties they have faced,  working with governments and regulators  towards expected recovery and future growth.  I am enormously proud of the professionalism,  dedication and energy that my colleagues  around the world have demonstrated as they  \nhelped ensure our customers received the  support they needed – all the while managing  their own, at times extremely difficult,  situations at home. On behalf of the Board, I  would like to express my deepest thanks to  them all for the exceptional way they are  responding to these most challenging  circumstances.  \nAgainst this backdrop, HSBC demonstrated a  resilient performance. Reported profit before  tax was  $\\S8.8\\mathsf{b r}$  , a fall of  $34\\%$  , and adjusted  profit before tax was   $\\S12.$  .1bn, down  $45\\%$  .  Within this, Global Banking and Markets  performed particularly well, while Asia was  once again by far the most profitable region.  Deposits also increased significantly across  the Group, reinforcing the strength of our  funding and liquidity positions. \nIn response to a request from the UK’s  Prudential Regulation Authority, we cancelled  the fourth interim dividend for 2019. We also  announced that, until the end of 2020, we  would make no quarterly or interim dividend  payments or accruals in respect of ordinary  shares. This was a difficult decision and we  deeply regret the impact it has had on our  shareholders. We are therefore pleased to  restart dividend payments at the earliest  opportunity.

This is the essence of what our  plans intend to deliver, and what we intend to  keep delivering for our customers, colleagues  and communities as we navigate change and  complexity together.  \nFinancial performance \nThe pandemic inevitably affected our 2020  financial performance. The shutdown of much  of the global economy in the first half of the  year caused a large rise in expected credit  losses, and cuts in central bank interest rates  reduced revenue in rate-sensitive business  lines. We responded by accelerating the  transformation of the Group, further reducing  our operating costs and moving our focus  from interest-rate sensitive business lines  towards fee-generating businesses. Our  expected credit losses stabilised in the second  half of the year in line with the changed  economic outlook, but the revenue  environment remained muted. \nAs a consequence, the Group delivered   $\\S8.8\\mathsf{b n}$   of reported profit before tax, down   $34\\%$   on 2019, and  $\\S12$  .1bn of adjusted profits,  down   $45\\%$  . Our Asia business was again the  major contributor, delivering   $\\mathbb{S}13\\mathsf{b n}$   of adjusted  profit before tax in 2020. \nAdjusted revenue was  $8\\%$   lower than in 2019.  This was due mainly to the impact of interest  rate cuts at the start of the year on our deposit  franchises in all three global businesses. By  contrast, our Global Markets business  benefited from increased customer activity  due to market volatility throughout the year,  growing adjusted revenue by   $27\\%$  . \nWe made strong progress in reducing our  operating expenses. A combination of our  cost-saving programmes, cuts in  performance-related pay and lower  discretionary spending due to the Covid-19  pandemic helped to reduce our adjusted  operating expenses by  $\\S1.$  .1bn or   $3\\%$  .

We will also\nneed to focus intently on the areas where\n\nwe excel, and to foster a commercial and\nentrepreneurial culture with a conviction to get\nthings done. We believe we can achieve this in\nfour ways.\n\nFirst, we plan to focus on and invest in the\nareas in which we are strongest. In Wealth\nand Personal Banking, we aim to become a\nmarket-leader for high net worth and ultra high\nnet worth clients in Asia and the Asian\ndiaspora, and to invest in our biggest retail\nmarkets where the opportunity is greatest.

We have an opportunity\nto meet the growing market need for\nsophisticated, robust and rapid payment\nsolutions, and to lead our industry in applying\ndigital solutions to analogue services, such as\ntrade. We therefore intend to protect\ntechnology investment throughout the cycle,\neven as we reduce spending elsewhere.\n\nThird, we want to energise HSBC for growth\nthrough a strong culture, simple ways of\nworking, and by equipping our colleagues\nwith the future skills they need. Giving life to\nour purpose will be critical to building the\ndynamic, entrepreneurial and inclusive culture\nthat we want to create, as will removing the\nremaining structural barriers that sometimes\nstop our people from delivering for our\ncustomers.

A specific\narea of focus arising from the Covid-19\npandemic included our colleagues’ mental and\nphysical health, which the Board monitored by\nway of frequent Snapshot and pulse surveys,\nand discussions with senior management on\nthe well-being of their teams. Another area of\nBoard focus, supported by guidance from\nsubject matter experts, was the evolving views\nand requirements of our customers, investors,\nemployees, communities and suppliers. The\neffects of the Covid-19 outbreak on these\n\n6 Customers\n\nOur business is centred around our customers and\nclients. The greater the understanding we have of\ntheir needs and the challenges they face, the better\nwe can support them to achieve their financial\naims.

For instance, to\nprotect and keep our shareholders and people\nsafe and in line with the advice from the UK\nGovernment, it was not possible for\nshareholders to attend our AGM.\nConsequently, shareholders did not have the\nopportunity to ask questions of the Board in\nperson, although alternative arrangements\nwere made to publish responses to written\nquestions on our website.

It describes how the  Directors have performed their duty to  \npromote the success of the company,  including how they have considered and  engaged with stakeholders and, in particular,  how they have taken account of the matters  set out in section 172(1)(a) to (f) of the  Companies Act 2006.  \n\nStakeholder engagement and Covid-19 \nThere were no changes to the Board’s  identified key stakeholders during the year,  namely our customers, employees, investors,  communities, suppliers, and regulators and  governments. In overseeing the business, the  Board sought to understand – and have  appropriate regard to – the interests and  priorities of these stakeholders, including in  relation to material decisions that were taken  during the course of the year.  \nEvents during the year called for careful  consideration of the needs and interests of the  company’s various stakeholders. A specific  area of focus arising from the Covid-19  pandemic included our colleagues’ mental and  physical health, which the Board monitored by  way of frequent Snapshot and pulse surveys,  and discussions with senior management on  the well-being of their teams. Another area of  Board focus, supported by guidance from  subject matter experts, was the evolving views  and requirements of our customers, investors,  employees, communities and suppliers. The  effects of the Covid-19 outbreak on these  \nCustomers \nOur business is centred around our customers and  clients. The greater the understanding we have of  their needs and the challenges they face, the better  we can support them to achieve their financial  aims. Examples of the Board engaging with  customers in 2020 included: \n– monthly Group Chief Executive Board reports,  which included updates on key customer  sentiment and activities; – reports from the Group Chief Executive on  meetings he held with customers across the world,  including pre-Covid-19 interactions and Covid-19  safe physical meetings in the UK and Asia; – regional and sector-based customer insights  developed through customer interactions with  senior management and relationship managers,  which were incorporated into relevant Board  reports; and  – customer survey feedback, including the   results of our 2020 Navigator survey and   net promoter scores.  \nstakeholders contributed to the development  of our Group strategy and purpose and values.  For further details of how the Board engaged  with stakeholders in adapting our Group  strategy and refreshing our purpose and  values, see ‘Board engagement with  shareholders’ on page 204. \nThe unique nature of the Covid-19 outbreak  also brought logistical challenges for  interacting with stakeholders. For instance, to  protect and keep our shareholders and people  safe and in line with the advice from the UK  Government, it was not possible for  shareholders to attend our AGM.  Consequently, shareholders did not have the  opportunity to ask questions of the Board in  person, although alternative arrangements  were made to publish responses to written  questions on our website.

Outside of Asia,\nin addition to higher ECL and lower interest\nrates, HSBC Bank plc and our US business\nincurred restructuring costs and charges from\nthe impairment of intangibles, in part as a\nresult of our strategic actions to address\nunderperformance.

Revenue relating to\nMarkets Treasury, which is allocated to our\nglobal businesses, also increased, primarily\ndue to increased disposal gains.\n\nReported revenue included net adverse\nmovements in significant items of $0.6bn,\nprimarily from the non-recurrence of a $0.8bn\ndilution gain in 2019 as discussed above.\nSignificant items in 2020 included restructuring\nand other related costs of $0.2bn associated\nwith disposal losses related to RWA\nreductions, as well as a property-related\n\ngain, both of which related to February 2020\nbusiness update commitments. Foreign\ncurrency translation differences resulted\n\nin a further adverse movement of $0.5bn\ncompared with 2019.\n\nWe have observed reductions in the Hong\nKong interbank offered rate (‘HIBOR’) in the\nearly part of 2021.

Additionally, the reduction\nreflected lower performance-related pay,\nreduced discretionary expenditure and the\nimpact of our cost-saving initiatives, partly\noffset by an increase in investments in\ntechnology, inflation and impairments of\ncertain real estate assets.\n\nThe movement in significant items included:\n\n—a $1.1bn impairment of goodwill and other\nintangibles in 2020, primarily capitalised\nsoftware related to the businesses within\nHSBC Bank plc and to a lesser extent in the\nUS. It reflected underperformance and a\ndeterioration in the future forecasts of these\nbusinesses, in the case of HSBC Bank plc\nsubstantially relating to prior periods. This\ncompared with an impairment of goodwill of\n$7.3bn in 2019, primarily related to lower\nlong-term economic growth assumptions in\nCMB and GBM, and the planned reshaping\nof GBM; and\n\n—a net release in customer redress\nprogramme costs of $0.1bn in 2020,\ncompared with charges of $1.3bn in 2019.\n\nThese were partly offset by restructuring and\nother related costs of $1.9bn in 2020, of which\n$0.9bn related to severance, $0.2bn related to\nan impairment of software intangibles and\n$0.2bn related to the impairment of tangible\nassets in France and the US.

Adjusted ECL increased by   $\\S6.2\\mathrm{bot}$  , mainly from charges in the first half of  2020 relating to the global impact of the  Covid-19 outbreak on the forward economic  outlook. Adjusted revenue decreased by   $\\S4.6\\mathsf{b}\\mathsf{n}$   or  $8\\%$  , primarily from the progressive  impact of lower global interest rates in all our  global businesses, notably in our deposit  franchises, partly offset by higher revenue  from Global Markets.

This had an adverse impact on\nrevenue in Retail Banking within WPB, and in\nGLCM within CMB and GBM, although we\ngrew deposit balances across these\nbusinesses compared with 2019. In WPB,\nrevenue also reduced as the impact of the\nCovid-19 outbreak resulted in lower customer\nactivity in unsecured lending, including a fall in\ncredit card spending, and a reduction in sales\nof insurance and certain investment products.\nIn GBM, adverse valuation movements,\nprimarily in the first quarter, partly reversed in\nthe subsequent quarters. This resulted in a net\nadverse movement in credit and funding\nvaluation adjustments of $0.3bn and a\nreduction in revenue of $0.1bn in Principal\nInvestments compared with 2019. In life\ninsurance manufacturing, the adverse market\nimpacts in the first quarter following the sharp\nfall in equity markets more than reversed over\nthe remainder of the year.\n\nThese reductions were partly offset by higher\nrevenue in Global Markets, as market volatility\nremained elevated, as well as in Corporate\n\nCentre.

The economic outlook stabilised in\nthe second half of 2020 and as a result, stage\n1 and stage 2 allowances were broadly\nunchanged at 31 December 2020, compared\nwith 30 June 2020. Stage 3 charges in 2020\nincreased compared with 2019, with the rise\nlargely related to wholesale exposures,\nincluding a significant charge related to a CMB\nclient in Singapore in the first quarter of 2020.\n\nAdjusted ECL as a percentage of average\ngross loans and advances to customers was\n0.81%, compared with 0.25% in 2019.\n\nAdjusted operating expenses »\nAdjusted operating expenses of $31.5bn were\n$1.1bn or 3% lower than in 2019, as we\ncontinued to review and reprioritise costs and\ninvestments to help mitigate revenue\n\nspending, resulting in larger balances held in\ncurrent and savings accounts.\n\nDistributable reserves\n\nThe distributable reserves of HSBC Holdings\nat 31 December 2020 were $31.3bn.\nMovements in 2020 included the retained\nearnings of HSBC Holdings plc for the year,\noffset by distributions to and redemptions of\npreference shares and other equity\ninstruments.

The\nreduction in adjusted profit before tax\nreflected a fall in adjusted revenue and an\nincrease in adjusted ECL from the impact of\nthe Covid-19 outbreak.

The\nreduction also included lower favourable\nmovement in market impacts of $38m\n(2020: $90m favourable, 2019: $128m\nfavourable), as the sharp adverse movement\nwe saw in the first quarter reversed over\nsubsequent quarters.\n\n—In Global Private Banking, revenue was\n$0.1bn or 7% lower, as net interest income\nfell as a result of lower global interest rates,\nalthough investment revenue increased,\nreflecting market volatility and higher fees\nfrom advisory and discretionary mandates.\n\nIn investment distribution, revenue was\n$0.1bn or 2% lower, reflecting adverse\nmarket conditions, which resulted in lower\nmutual fund sales and a reduction in wealth\ninsurance distribution.

A Trade and Cooperation Agreement  between the EU and the UK was agreed on 24  December 2020 and ratified by the UK on 30  December 2020. The deal mainly focused on  goods and services but also covered a wide  range of other areas, including competition,  state aid, tax, fisheries, transport, data and  security. However, it included limited elements  on financial services, and, as a result, did not  change HSBC’s planning in relation to the UK’s  withdrawal from the EU. \nThe EU and UK agreed through a joint  declaration to establish structured regulatory  cooperation on financial services, with the aim  of establishing a durable and stable relationship  between autonomous jurisdictions.

These changes have enabled HSBC to  meet regulatory endorsed milestones related  to product readiness and the clearing  house-led transition to RFR discounting.  Additionally, to further support our business  and our customers, our programme’s scope  has widened to include additional interest rate  benchmarks, which now have a plan for  demise in the near future.

Emerging risks are those that have  large unknown components and may form  beyond a one-year horizon. If any of these  risks were to occur, it could have a material  adverse effect on HSBC. \nOur suite of top and emerging risks is subject  to review by senior governance forums.

The Covid-19 outbreak, heightened US-China geopolitical tensions and the UK's withdrawal from\nthe EU have resulted in an unprecedented global economic slowdown, leading to a significant increase in credit\nstress in our portfolio. We have increased the frequency and depth of monitoring activities, and performed\nstress tests and other sectoral reviews to identify portfolios or customers who were experiencing, or were likely\nto experience, financial difficulty as a result.\n\nCyber threat and\nunauthorised access to\nsystems\n\nWe help protect HSBC and our customers by continuing to strengthen our cyber defences, helping enable the\nsafe execution of our business priorities and the security of our customers’ information. Our data-driven\napproach, grounded in strong controls that help to mitigate advanced cyber threats, enhances our capability\nin threat detection, access controls and resiliency.\n\nRegulatory compliance\nrisk environment,\nincluding conduct\n\nWe monitor regulatory developments closely and engage with regulators, as appropriate, to help ensure that\nnew regulatory requirements are implemented effectively and in a timely way. In addition to developments\ndriven by the Covid-19 outbreak, we are keeping abreast of the emerging regulatory agenda, which is\nincreasingly focused on diversity, sustainable development, climate change, operational resilience and digital\nservices and innovation.\n\nFinancial crime risk\nenvironment\n\nWe continued to support the business and our customers throughout the Covid-19 outbreak, while ensuring that\nour controls remained effective to manage financial crime risk. We progressed with our plans to improve our\nfraud controls and continue to invest in both advanced analytics and artificial intelligence (‘Al’), which remain key\ncomponents of our next generation of tools to fight financial crime. Additionally we continued to update our\npolicies and controls in response to new, increasingly complex sanctions and export control regulations, which\nreflected heightened geopolitical tensions.\n\nIbor transition\n\nWe remain focused on providing alternative near risk-free rate products, and the supporting processes and\nsystems, to replace all outstanding Ibor-linked contracts that are on a demise path. We engage with industry\nparticipants and regulatory working groups to aid an orderly transition within the required timelines. In light of\ndelays in market and client readiness caused by the Covid-19 outbreak, we are engaging and prioritising clients\nfor transition of their outstanding contracts linked to Ibors that already have a confirmed demise.\n\nClimate-related risks\n\nWe continue to enhance the identification, oversight and management of climate risk. In 2020, we enhanced\nour climate risk appetite statement with quantitative metrics to articulate the risks from climate change, and\nformalised our overall approach to climate risk management. We also started to integrate climate risk into the\nGroup-wide risk management framework (see our TCFD Update 2020 for further information).\n\nInternally driven\n\nIT systems\ninfrastructure and\nresilience\n\nWe actively monitor and improve service resilience across our technology infrastructure to minimise service\ndisruption to our customers, and enhance our service management disciplines and change execution\ncapabilities.

We have put in place measures to help ensure that\nour people are supported and able to work safely during the Covid-19 outbreak. We are monitoring people\nrisks that may arise due to business transformation to help ensure that we sensitively manage any\nredundancies and support impacted employees.\n\nRisks arising from the\nreceipt of services from\nthird parties\n\nWe continue to enhance our third-party risk management programme to help ensure engagements comply with\nour third-party risk policy and required standards. We work closely with providers to monitor performance. In\n2021, we will continue to strengthen our third-party risk framework and improve our technology, process and\npeople capabilities.\n\nModel risk\nmanagement\n\nWe continue to strengthen our oversight of models and the second line of defence Model Risk Management\nfunction. We are embedding a new model risk policy, which includes updated controls around the monitoring\nand use of models. We have developed new model risk appetite measures, which we expect to implement in the\nfirst quarter of 2021. A redevelopment of our IFRS 9 and capital models is underway to reflect the potential\neffects of the extreme economic shocks and various government support measures as a consequence of the\nCovid-19 outbreak.\n\nData management\n\nWe continue to enhance and advance our insights, data aggregation, reporting and decisions through\nongoing improvement and investments in data governance, data quality, data privacy, data architecture, and\nanalytics (including machine learning and Al capabilities). Our work to modernise our data infrastructure also\ncontinues, building on the Cloud to increase flexibility and scalability and improve our fit-for-purpose data\nwhile also respecting the evolving regulatory landscape regarding the localisation of data. This is a crucial\ncomponent of effectively managing our risk.\n\nChange execution risk\n\nWe have established a global transformation programme to oversee all initiatives mobilised to deliver the\ncommitments made to restructure the business and reduce costs. The related execution risks are being\nmonitored and managed, recognising that many initiatives impact our colleagues and require continued\ninvestment in technology.

For our colleagues, we adapted to new ways  of working and provided extra support and  resources to manage their mental and physical  health. We also announced our climate  ambition of net zero by 2050, but we know  this is a journey and that the current means   of tracking emissions globally need improving. \nIn this Environmental, Social and Governance  (‘ESG’) review, we aim to set out our approach  to our climate, customers, employees and  governance. \nEnvironmental \n– We announced our net zero climate ambition and increased our climate  disclosures under TCFD, but we recognise more work is needed as methods   to measure progress evolve. – We surpassed our goal of reducing  $\\mathsf{C O}_{2}$  acknowledge this was mainly due to the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThe image shows two icons.

We use the information  they provide us to identify the issues that are  most important to them – and consequently  also matter to our own business. \nOur ESG Steering Committee and other  relevant governance bodies regularly discuss  the new and existing themes and issues that  matter to our stakeholders. Our management  team then uses this insight, alongside the  framework of the ESG Guide (which refers   to our obligations under the Environmental,  Social and Governance Reporting Guide  contained in Appendix 27 to The Rules  Governing the Listing of Securities on the  Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited)   to choose what we measure and publicly  report in this ESG review.  \n\nRecognising the need for a consistent and  global set of ESG metrics, we have committed  to start aligning to World Economic Forum  core metrics from next year. \nUnder the ESG Guide, ’materiality’ is  considered to be the threshold at which   \nESG issues become sufficiently important   to our investors and other stakeholders that  they should be publicly reported. We are   also informed by stock exchange listing and  disclosure rules globally. We know that what   is important to our stakeholders evolves over  time and we will continue to assess our  approach to ensure we remain relevant in  what we measure and publicly report.  \nFor further information on our approach to  reporting, see the ‘Additional information’   section on page 375.

Our supplier emissions are  currently calculated using a methodology  based on supplier spend. In 2020, we began  the three-year process of targeting our largest  suppliers, representing  $60\\%$   of our annual  supplier spend, to encourage them to make  their own carbon commitments, and to  disclose their emissions via the CDP supply  chain programme. This programme will allow  us to work with our suppliers to understand  their commitment to carbon emission  reduction, to educate those that are starting  their journey, and to collaborate with those  that are leading in this area.  \nIn 2017, we pledged to provide and facilitate   $\\S100{\\mathrm{b}}\\mathsf{n}$   of sustainable finance and investment  by 2025 to support our customers as they  switch to more sustainable ways of doing  business, and by the end of 2020 we had  already achieved  $\\S93.0$  bn of that ambition.   In October 2020, we set ourselves a new  target of providing between  $\\S750\\mathsf{b r}$   and    $\\Updownarrow^{\\prime}$  1tn in sustainable finance and investment   by 2030 (for further details, see page 48).  \nIncluded within the   $\\mathbb{S}100{\\mathrm{b}}\\mathsf{n}$   facilitation  total is  $\\S2.8$  bn-worth of advisory services  on HSBC-issued green/SDG bonds.

The Y-axis on the left measures total CO2 emissions in tonnes, ranging from 400,000 to 1,000,000. The Y-axis on the right measures CO2 emissions per FTE in tonnes, ranging from 1.0 to 4.0.\nwhere we have operational control and a  small presence, we scale up the emissions  data from   $93\\%$   to   $100\\%$  . \nOur carbon dioxide emissions in 2020 \nWe report our carbon emissions following  the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, which  incorporates the scope 2 market-based  emission methodology. We report carbon  dioxide emissions resulting from energy   use in our buildings and employees’  business travel.  \nWe then apply emission uplift rates to   reflect uncertainty concerning the quality  and coverage of emission measurement and  estimation. The rates are  $4\\%$   for electricity,   $10\\%$   for other energy and  $6\\%$   for business  travel. This is consistent both with the  Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change’s Good Practice Guidance and  Uncertainty Management in National  Greenhouse Gas Inventories and our internal  analysis of data coverage and quality. \nIn 2020, we surpassed our carbon emissions  target of 2.0 tonnes per FTE, achieving 1.76  tonnes per FTE. This was mainly attributed  to travel restrictions and the reduction of  usage of our buildings due to the Covid-19  outbreak. We also implemented over   600 energy conservation measures that  amounted to an estimated energy   avoidance in excess of 15 million kWh. \nFurther details on our methodology,   our third-party assurance report and  relevant environment key facts found   in our ESG Data Pack can each be found   at www.hsbc.com/esg. \nIn 2020, we collected data on energy   use and business travel for our operations   in 28 countries and territories, which  accounted for approximately  $93\\%$   of our  FTEs. To estimate the emissions of our  operations in countries and territories   \nCarbon dioxide emissions in tonnes per FTE Energy consumption in GWh \nThe table presents data comparing figures from 2019 to 2020 for various categories. The categories listed are \"Total,\" \"From energy,\" \"Included energy UK,\" and \"From travel.\" There is a downward arrow next to each figure for 2020, indicating a decrease from 2019 to 2020.\n\n- The \"Total\" amount decreased from 530,000 in 2019 to 406,000 in 2020.\n- The \"From energy\" category decreased from 414,000 in 2019 to 363,000 in 2020.\n- The \"Included energy UK\" category decreased from 10,400 in 2019 to 8,000 in 2020.\n- The \"From travel\" category decreased from 116,000 in 2019 to 43,000 in 2020.\nThe table presents a comparison of some numerical data between the years 2020 and 2019. Although not explicitly stated, the context suggests these numbers might be related to reductions, possibly in emissions or resource usage, given the downward arrows and the context of \"energy\" and \"travel\".\n\n- For \"Total,\" the figure is 1.76 in 2020, down from 2.26 in 2019.\n- For \"From energy,\" the figure is 1.57 in 2020, down from 1.76 in 2019.\n- For \"From travel,\" the figure is 0.19 in 2020, down from 0.5 in 2019.\n\nThe downward arrows indicate a decrease in the numbers from 2019 to 2020 in each category."}

However,\naddressing climate change requires the world\n— particularly emerging markets — to develop\nanew generation of sustainable infrastructure\nquickly. The OECD estimates that up to\n$6.9tn each year is needed through to 2030\nto achieve this. While many institutions\n\nhave been engaged in mobilising finance\n\nfor this purpose, there remains a significant\ninvestment gap and lack of adequate,\nbankable projects. Stronger standards are\nalso needed to bring investors to the table.\n\nTo help solve for this, we are leading\n\nthe Finance to Accelerate the Sustainable\nTransition-Infrastructure (‘FAST-Infra’) initiative.\nThis was established in partnership with the\nInternational Finance Corporation (‘IFC’), the\nOECD, the World Bank's Global Infrastructure\nFacility and Climate Policy Initiative under the\nauspices of the One Planet Lab to develop a\nconsistent, globally applicable labelling system\nfor sustainable infrastructure investment.\n\nThis will aim to ensure that governments and\nproject developers embed high ESG standards\ninto new infrastructure to access this label.

The OECD estimates that up to    $\\S6.9\\uptcap$   each year is needed through to 2030   to achieve this.

This was established in partnership with the  International Finance Corporation (‘IFC’), the  OECD, the World Bank’s Global Infrastructure  Facility and Climate Policy Initiative under the  auspices of the One Planet Lab to develop a  consistent, globally applicable labelling system  for sustainable infrastructure investment.

This suggests a theme of renewable energy and urban development.\nOur energy policy \nWhen we last updated our energy  policy in 2018, we stated that we  would not finance any new coal-fired  power plants, with the potential  targeted and time-limited exceptions  in Bangladesh, Indonesia and  Vietnam, recognising the need to  balance local humanitarian needs  with the need to transition to a  low-carbon economy. \nWe therefore agreed that any  funding of new coal-fired power  plants in those three countries would  only be considered subject to certain  strict criteria. It is important to note  that we have not provided any  project finance for any new coal-fired  power plants anywhere in the world  since then, including those countries. \nIn April 2020, we removed these  exceptions and will not finance   any new coal-fired power plants  anywhere globally. We continue   to support the other needs of our  customers in these countries and  continue to support their  governments. \nWithin the power and utilities, and  metals and mining sectors shown   in our TCFD disclosures on page 19,  our direct exposure to thermal coal   is  $0.2\\%$   of the wholesale loans and  advances figures.

We achieved  $30.3\\%$  . Appointments  of external female candidates into senior  leadership reduced from   $33.0\\%$   in 2019 to   $31.6\\%$   in 2020. We will continue efforts to build  more gender-balanced leadership teams and  have set ourselves a target to achieve  $35\\%$    women in senior leadership roles by 2025. \nTo diversify the talent pipeline, every member  of our Group Executive Committee, as well as  many members of their management teams,  actively sponsor colleagues from under- represented groups, including women.   We paid specific attention to how we select  and promote candidates for roles and how  colleagues can readily access opportunities. \nIn 2020, we expanded the Accelerating into  Leadership programme to all businesses and  functions. The programme provides group  coaching, networking and development for  high-performing women at manager level,  which are those at level 4 in our global career  band structure. Our Accelerating Female  Leaders programme, which focuses on  developing high-performing women at level 3  in the global career band structure, was  attended by four times as many women   in 2020 than in the previous year.  \nFocus on UK gender and ethnicity   pay gaps  \nIn 2020, our median aggregate UK-wide  gender pay gap, including all reported HSBC  entities, was  $48\\%$  , and our median bonus gap  was  $57.9\\%$  . Our overall UK gender pay gap   is driven by the shape of our UK workforce.  There are more men than women in senior and  high-paid roles, and more women than men in  junior roles, many of which are part-time.  \nFor the first time we also published our UK  ethnicity pay gap. Our median aggregate  UK-wide ethnicity pay gap across all reported  HSBC entities was   $.5.6\\%$  . Our median bonus  gap was   $0.8\\%$  . However, the pay gaps differ  depending on the underlying ethnic minority  group. The businesses and roles which  employees from different ethnic groups work  in impact the gaps, with relatively lower  representation of ethnic minority employees in  senior, higher paid roles. While  $79\\%$   of our UK  employees have declared their ethnicity, fewer  senior, higher paid employees have done so   to date and were therefore not included in our  ethnicity pay gap analysis. \nWe intend to publish ethnicity representation  and pay gap data annually to help ensure we  continue making progress and help us identify  further areas for action. \nWe review our pay practices regularly and   also work with independent third parties to  review equal pay. The most recent exercise  was undertaken in 2020. If pay differences   are identified that are not due to objective,  tangible reasons such as performance or skills  and experience, we make adjustments. \nOur complete Gender and Ethnicity UK Pay Gap  Report 2020, along with more information about  our pay gaps and related actions, can be found at  www.hsbc.com/who-we-are/our-people-and- communities/diversity-and-inclusion. \nThe table shows a breakdown of different groups or committees within an organization, with each section detailing two sets of numbers. One set is in purple, and the other in gray, each accompanied by a percentage. The groups listed include the Holdings Board, Group Executive Committee, Combined Executive Committee and Direct Reports, Senior Leadership, and others like WPB, CMB, GBM, and Digital Business Services. The final row covers \"All employees.\"\n\nFor example:\n\n- Holdings Board: 9 (64%) in purple, 5 (36%) in gray.\n- Group Executive Committee: 13 (81%) in purple, 3 (19%) in gray.\n- All employees: 111,422 (48%) in purple, 119,618 (52%) in gray.\n\nThe purple numbers and percentages are consistently higher than the gray ones except for the \"All employees\" category, where the purple percentage is lower.\nMale  Female \n1 \u0007 Combined executive committee and direct reports  includes HSBC executive Directors, Group  Managing Directors, Group Company Secretary  and Chief Governance Officer and their direct  reports (excluding administrative staff).  2 \u0007 Senior leadership refers to employees performing  roles classified as 0, 1, 2 and 3 in our global career  band structure. \nThe image consists of two donut charts displaying the gender distribution of all employees and senior leaders in a company, along with a comparison to figures from 2019.\n\n1. **All Employees Chart**: \n   - The chart shows that the overall workforce is made up of 48% males (purple) and 52% females (gray).\n   - These percentages remained the same when compared to 2019.\n\n2. **Senior Leaders Chart**: \n   - This chart illustrates that senior leadership is composed of 70% males (purple) and 30% females (gray).\n   - There has been a slight change from 2019, where males made up 71% and females made up 29% of senior leadership.\n\nThe caption \"Percentage of our senior leadership who are women\" refers to the data shown in the Senior Leaders chart, highlighting that 30% of senior leaders are female.\nOur approach to ethnicity and Black Lives Matter  \nIn May 2020, we launched a global ethnicity  inclusion programme to help us respond to  challenges that we identified through our  data. This programme aims to improve the  diversity of our workforce ethnicity profile  across the organisation to reflect the  customers and communities we serve.  \nThe tragic death of George Floyd in the US  accelerated conversations around race and  ethnicity across the Group. Listening to what  our colleagues have told us in response to  the Black Lives Matter movement has been  so important in informing our actions. In July  2020, we also set out our race commitments  to improve opportunities for Black and ethnic  minority colleagues and boost the diversity  of our senior leadership. \n\nAs part of this, we set an aspirational target  \nto at least double the number of Black  employees in senior leadership roles from   $0.7\\%$   at 31 December 2020 to   $1.3\\%$   globally  by 2025. To achieve our commitments,   we are also strengthening our recruitment  processes, partnering with specialist search  firms, and enhancing talent development  opportunities. In October 2020, we also  published country-specific ethnicity data   and action plans in the UK and US. "}

We expect our flagship  programme to help build future skills and   that this will in turn drive further improvements  in engagement levels.  \nMeasuring employee focus  \nOur employee focus index tells us about   our colleagues’ perception of their work. The  2020 results were four points above our peers.  This will be a key measure of progress for our  transformation and our programme to build  future skills.  \nMeasuring strategy and change leadership \nOur strategy index, which measures how  employees feel about HSBC’s direction,   was just below its benchmark. However,   the index included an improvement in scores  for questions on whether colleagues see a  positive impact of our strategy and if they   have confidence in the future. Our efforts   to reshape the business and the uncertain  business environment are affecting these  results, and we recognise the challenge   this creates for colleagues. Despite these  challenges, our change leadership index,  which measures how employees feel about  change communication and leadership setting  a positive example, performed in line with   the benchmark. This will continue to be vital  during our ongoing transformation. \nMeasuring speak-up and trust \nOur speak-up index rose six points from  November 2019, representing the biggest  improvement in the indices we measure.  Similarly, trust, particularly in senior  leadership, improved significantly. These  results are encouraging but need to be viewed  in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak   where research showed our colleagues were  positive about HSBC’s handling of the crisis.  Maintaining these gains through a period of  ongoing change and uncertainty will require  sustained effort. \nWhistleblowing concerns raised  (subject to investigation) in 2020  \nThe image contains the numbers \"2,510\" followed by \"(2019: 2,808)\" below it, suggesting a comparison between two different values, possibly from different years.

To measure our performance, we supplement our IFRS figures  with non-IFRS measures that constitute alternative performance  measures under European Securities and Markets Authority  guidance and non-GAAP financial measures defined in and  presented in accordance with US Securities and Exchange  Commission rules and regulations. These measures include those  derived from our reported results that eliminate factors that distort  year-on-year comparisons. The ‘adjusted performance’ measure  used throughout this report is described below. Definitions and  calculations of other alternative performance measures are  included in our ‘Reconciliation of alternative performance  measures’ on page 103. All alternative performance measures are  reconciled to the closest reported performance measure. \nA change in reportable segments was made in 2020 by combining  Global Private Banking and Retail Banking and Wealth  Management to form Wealth and Personal Banking. We also  reallocated our reporting of Markets Treasury, hyperinflation  accounting in Argentina and HSBC Holdings net interest expense  from Corporate Centre to the global businesses. Comparative data  have been re-presented on an adjusted basis in accordance with  IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ with the change in reportable  segments explained in more detail in Note 10: Segmental analysis  on page 311. \nAdjusted performance \nAdjusted performance is computed by adjusting reported results  for the effects of foreign currency translation differences and  significant items, which both distort year-on-year comparisons. We consider adjusted performance provides useful information for  investors by aligning internal and external reporting, identifying  and quantifying items management believes to be significant, and  providing insight into how management assesses year-on-year  performance. \nSignificant items \n‘Significant items’ refers collectively to the items that  management and investors would ordinarily identify and consider  separately to improve the understanding of the underlying trends  in the business.  \nThe tables on pages 85 to 88 and pages 94 to 99 detail the effects  of significant items on each of our global business segments,  geographical regions and selected countries/territories in 2020,  2019 and 2018. \nForeign currency translation differences \nForeign currency translation differences reflect the movements of  the US dollar against most major currencies during 2020.  We exclude them to derive constant currency data, allowing us to  assess balance sheet and income statement performance on a  like-for-like basis and better understand the underlying trends in  the business. \nNo adjustment has been made to the exchange rates used to translate  foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities into the functional  currencies of any HSBC branches, subsidiaries, joint ventures or  associates. The constant currency data of HSBC’s Argentinian subsidiaries  have not been adjusted further for the impacts of hyperinflation. When  reference is made to foreign currency translation differences in tables or  commentaries, comparative data reported in the functional currencies of  HSBC’s operations have been translated at the appropriate exchange  rates applied in the current period on the basis described above. \nChanges from 1 January 2020 \nInterest rate benchmark reform – Phase 2 \nInterest Rate Benchmark Reform Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9,  IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 issued in August 2020  represents the second phase of the IASB’s project on the effects of  interest rate benchmark reform, addressing issues affecting  financial statements when changes are made to contractual cash  flows and hedging relationships as a result of the reform.  \nUnder these amendments, changes made to a financial instrument  that are economically equivalent and required by interest rate  benchmark reform do not result in the derecognition or a change  in the carrying amount of the financial instrument, but instead  require the effective interest rate to be updated to reflect the  change in the interest rate benchmark. In addition, hedge  accounting will not be discontinued solely because of the  replacement of the interest rate benchmark if the hedge meets  other hedge accounting criteria. \nThese amendments apply from 1 January 2021 with early adoption  permitted. HSBC has adopted the amendments from 1 January  2020 and has made the additional disclosures as required by the  amendments, see pages 112 to 113.  \nCritical accounting estimates and judgements \nThe results of HSBC reflect the choice of accounting policies,  assumptions and estimates that underlie the preparation of  HSBC’s consolidated financial statements. The significant  accounting policies, including the policies which include  critical accounting estimates and judgements, are described  in Note 1.2 on the financial statements. The accounting policies  listed below are highlighted as they involve a high degree of  uncertainty and have a material impact on the financial  statements:\n\n \n• Impairment of amortised cost financial assets and financial  assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive  income (‘FVOCI’): The most significant judgements relate to  defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit  risk, determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of  revolving facilities, and making assumptions and estimates to  incorporate relevant information about past events, current  conditions and forecasts of economic conditions. A high degree  of uncertainty is involved in making estimations using  assumptions that are highly subjective and very sensitive to the  risk factors. See Note 1.2(i) on page 293.\n\n • Deferred tax assets: The most significant judgements relate to  judgements made in respect of expected future profitability.  See Note 1.2(l) on page 298.\n\n • Valuation of financial instruments: In determining the fair value  of financial instruments a variety of valuation techniques are  used, some of which feature significant unobservable inputs  and are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Note 1.2(c) on  page 291.\n\n • Impairment of interests in associates: Impairment testing  involves significant judgement in determining the value in use,  and in particular estimating the present values of cash flows  expected to arise from continuing to hold the investment,  based on a number of management assumptions. The most  significant judgements relate to the impairment testing of our  investment in Bank of Communications Co., Limited (‘BoCom’).  See Note 1.2(a) on page 290. "}

Excluding this, NIM fell by 25bps.\n\nNIM for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 1.22%, down 34bps year-\non-year, and up 2bps compared with the previous quarter. The\nyear-on-year decrease was mainly driven by Asia and caused by\nthe impact of lower market interest rates.

The categories of liabilities include deposits by banks, customer accounts, repurchase agreements – non-trading, debt securities in issue – non-trading, and other interest-bearing liabilities. \n\nFor each category, the table lists the average balance, interest expense, and cost (in percentage terms) for the respective years. Summarized key metrics include:\n\n1. **Deposits by Banks**: \n   - *2020:* Average balance of $65,536 million, interest expense of $330 million, cost of 0.50%.\n   - *2019:* Average balance of $52,515 million, interest expense of $702 million, cost of 1.34%.\n   - *2018:* Average balance of $44,530 million, interest expense of $506 million, cost of 1.14%.\n\n2. **Customer Accounts**: \n   - *2020:* Average balance of $1,254,249 million, interest expense of $6,478 million, cost of 0.52%.\n   - *2019:* Average balance of $1,149,483 million, interest expense of $11,238 million, cost of 0.98%.\n   - *2018:* Average balance of $1,138,620 million, interest expense of $8,287 million, cost of 0.73%.\n\n3. **Repurchase Agreements – Non-trading**: \n   - *2020:* Average balance of $125,376 million, interest expense of $963 million, cost of 0.77%.\n   - *2019:* Average balance of $160,850 million, interest expense of $4,023 million, cost of 2.50%.\n   - *2018:* Average balance of $161,204 million, interest expense of $3,409 million, cost of 2.11%.\n\n4. **Debt Securities in Issue – Non-trading**: \n   - *2020:* Average balance of $219,610 million, interest expense of $4,944 million, cost of 2.25%.\n   - *2019:* Average balance of $211,229 million, interest expense of $6,522 million, cost of 3.09%.\n   - *2018:* Average balance of $183,434 million, interest expense of $5,675 million, cost of 3.09%.\n\n5. **Other Interest-bearing Liabilities**: \n   - *2020:* Average balance of $76,395 million, interest expense of $1,463 million, cost of 1.92%.\n   - *2019:* Average balance of $59,980 million, interest expense of $1,748 million, cost of 2.91%.\n   - *2018:* Average balance of $53,731 million, interest expense\nNet interest income (‘NII’)  for 2020 was  $\\S27.6\\mathsf{b n}$  , a decrease of   $\\S2.9\\mathsf{b n}$   or  $9.5\\%$   compared with 2019. This reflected lower average  market interest rates across the major currencies compared with  2019. This was partly offset by interest income associated with the  increase in average interest-earning assets (‘AIEA’) of  $\\S170.1$  1bn or   $8.8\\%$  . \nExcluding the favourable impact of significant items and the  adverse effects of foreign currency translation differences, net  interest income decreased by  $\\S2.7\\mathsf{b n}$   or  $9\\%$  . \nNII for the fourth quarter of 2020 was  $\\S6.6\\mathsf{b n}$  , down  $13.5\\%$   year- on-year, and up  $2.6\\%$   compared with the previous quarter. The  year-on-year decrease was driven by the impact of lower market  interest rates predominantly in Asia and North America. This was  partly offset by higher NII from growth in AIEA, notably short-term  funds and financial investments and predominantly in Asia and  Europe. The increase compared with the previous quarter was  mainly driven by lower rates on customer deposits and issued  debt securities, which were partly offset by lower rates on AIEA. \nNet interest margin (‘NIM’)  for 2020 of   $1.32\\%$   was 26 basis  points (‘bps’) lower compared with 2019 as the reduction in the  yield on AIEA of 84bps was partly offset by the fall in funding  costs of average interest-bearing liabilities of 67bps. The decrease  in NIM in 2020 included the favourable impacts of significant  items and the adverse effects of foreign currency translation  differences. Excluding this, NIM fell by 25bps. \nNIM for the fourth quarter of 2020 was  $1.22\\%,$  , down 34bps year- on-year, and up 2bps compared with the previous quarter. The  year-on-year decrease was mainly driven by Asia and caused by  the impact of lower market interest rates. The increase compared  with the previous quarter was driven by a reduction in funding  costs of average interest-bearing liabilities of 8bps, which was  partly offset by a reduction in the yield on AIEA of 5bps. \nInterest income  for 2020 of   $\\S41$  .8bn decreased by  $\\S12.9$  bn or   $24\\%$  , primarily due to the lower average interest rates compared  with 2019 as the yield on AIEA fell by 84bps. This was partly offset  by income from balance sheet growth, predominantly in Asia and  Europe. The balance sheet growth was driven by higher balances  in short-term funds and loans and advances to banks and financial  investments, which increased by  $\\S85.3\\mathsf{b}\\mathsf{n}$   and  $\\S45.6\\mathsf{b n}$  ,  respectively. The decrease in interest income included   $\\S0.2$  bn in  relation to the favourable impact of significant items and  $\\S0.8\\mathsf{b n}$    from the adverse effects of foreign currency translation  differences. Excluding these, interest income decreased by   $\\S12.3\\mathsf{b n}$  . "}

In addition, our cost-saving initiatives resulted in a\nreduction of $1.4bn, of which $1.0bn related to our costs to\nachieve programme, and the UK bank levy was $0.2bn lower than\nin 2019. These decreases were partly offset by an increase in\ninvestments in technology to enhance our digital and automation\ncapabilities to improve how we serve our customers, as well as\ninflation and volume-related increases. In addition, the 2020 period\nincluded impairments of certain real estate assets.\n\nDuring 2020, we reduced the number of employees expressed in\nfull-time equivalent staff (‘FTE’) and contractors by 11,011. This\nincluded a 9,292 reduction in FTE to 226,059 at 31 December\n2020, while the number of contractors reduced by 1,719 to 5,692\nat 31 December 2020.\n\nShare of profit in associates and joint ventures of $1.6bn\nwas $0.8bn or 32% lower than in 2019, primarily reflecting our\nshare of an impairment of goodwill by SABB of $0.5bn. This\ngoodwill was recognised by SABB on the completion of its merger\nwith Alawwal bank in 2019. The remaining reduction reflected a\nlower share of profit recognised from our associates in Asia and\nMENA due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the lower\ninterest-rate environment.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, we performed an impairment review of our\ninvestment in BoCom and concluded that it was not impaired,\nbased on our value-in-use (‘VIU’) calculations. However, the\nexcess of the VIU of BoCom and its carrying value has reduced\nover the period, increasing the risk of impairment in the future.\nFor more information, see Note 18: Interests in associates and\njoint ventures on page 331.\n\nTax expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for 2020 of 30.5% was lower than the 34.8%\neffective tax rate for 2019. An impairment of goodwill and non-\ndeductible customer redress charges increased the 2019 effective\ntax rate. These were not repeated in 2020. Additionally, the non-\ntaxable dilution gain arising on the merger of SABB with Alawwal\nbank decreased the effective tax rate in 2019. Higher charges in\nrespect of the non-recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly\nin the UK ($0.4bn) and France ($0.4bn), increased the 2020\neffective tax rate.\n\nHSBC Holdings ple Annual Report and Accounts 2020 81\n", "vlm_text": "assumptions.

In addition, our cost-saving initiatives resulted in a  reduction of   $\\S1.4\\mathsf{b n}$  , of which  $\\S1.0\\mathsf{b r}$   related to our costs to  achieve programme, and the UK bank levy was  $\\S0.2\\mathsf{b r}$   lower than  in 2019.

The remaining reduction reflected a  lower share of profit recognised from our associates in Asia and  MENA due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the lower  interest-rate environment. \nAt 31 December 2020, we performed an impairment review of our  investment in BoCom and concluded that it was not impaired,  based on our value-in-use (‘VIU’) calculations. However, the  excess of the VIU of BoCom and its carrying value has reduced  over the period, increasing the risk of impairment in the future.

An impairment of goodwill and non- deductible customer redress charges increased the 2019 effective  tax rate. These were not repeated in 2020. Additionally, the non- taxable dilution gain arising on the merger of SABB with Alawwal  bank decreased the effective tax rate in 2019. Higher charges in  respect of the non-recognition of deferred tax assets, particularly  in the UK   $(\\S0.4\\mathsf{b n})$   and France (\\$0.4bn), increased the 2020  effective tax rate. "}

There was also an increase in foreign exchange\ncontracts linked to valuation movements attributable to market\nconditions. The growth in derivative assets was consistent with\nthe increase in derivative liabilities, as the underlying risk is\nbroadly matched.\n\nLoans and advances to customers of $1.0tn increased by $1bn\non a reported basis. This included favourable foreign currency\ntranslation differences of $26bn. Excluding the effects of foreign\ncurrency translation differences, loans and advances to customers\ndecreased by $25bn or 2%.\n\nThe commentary below is on a constant currency basis.\n\nIn GBM, customer lending was down $28bn or 11%, while in CMB\ncustomer lending was down $11bn or 3%. Despite significant\ngrowth in these businesses in the first quarter of 2020 from\ncustomers drawing down on credit facilities, balances\nsubsequently reduced as customers made repayments in part due\nto the uncertain economic outlook.\n\nIn GBM, lower lending was mainly from decreases in term lending\nin Asia, Europe and the US, and also from a decrease in overdrafts\nin Europe.\n\nIn CMB, the decrease in customer lending reflected a reduction in\nother lending and overdrafts in Asia and North America. In Europe,\nlending remained relatively flat as lower other lending and\noverdrafts were almost entirely offset by a rise in term lending.\n\nIn WPB, lending increased by $14bn or 3%, notably from\nmortgage growth in the UK (up $12bn) and in Hong Kong (up\n$5bn).

We increased our holdings of\ndebt securities and treasury bills and benefited from valuation\ngains resulting from interest rate reductions.

Additionally, there were increases in\nprecious metals balances, mainly in the US as we grew our\ndepository.\n\nLiabi\nCustomer accounts of $1.6tn increased by $204bn or 14% ona\nreported basis and included the favourable effect of foreign\n\ncurrency translation differences of $31bn. Excluding this,\ncustomer accounts increased by $173bn or 12%.\n\nies\n\nThe commentary below is on a constant currency basis.\n\nCustomer accounts increased in all our global businesses and\nregions. In CMB, balances grew by $73bn, and in GBM, customer\naccounts increased by $33bn. These increases included the impact\nof corporate clients consolidating their funds and depositing these\ninto their customer accounts to maintain liquidity, notably in the\nUK, Hong Kong and the US.\n\nIn WPB, customer account balances increased by $67bn, notably\nin the UK and Hong Kong, reflecting reduced customer spending\nresulting in larger balances held in current and savings accounts.\n\nRepurchase agreements — non-trading decreased by $28bn or\n20%, primarily in the US, in line with our actions to manage our\nfunding requirements across the Group.\n\nDerivative liabilities increased by $64bn or 27%, which is\nconsistent with the increase in derivative assets, since the\nunderlying risk is broadly matched.\n\nEquity\n\nTotal shareholders’ equity, including non-controlling interests,\nincreased by $12bn or 6% compared with 31 December 2019,\nreflecting the effects of profits generated of $6.1bn combined with\nother comprehensive income (‘OCI’) of $8bn. OCI included fair\nvalue gains on debt instruments of $2bn, favourable\nremeasurement of defined benefit pension obligations of $1bn and\nforeign exchange differences of $5bn. These increases were partly\noffset by $2bn of coupon distributions on securities classified as\nequity and dividends paid by non-controlling interests.\n\nRisk-weighted assets\n\nRisk-weighted assets (‘RWAs’) totalled $857.5bn at 31 December\n2020, a $14.1bn increase since 2019. Excluding foreign currency\ntranslation differences, RWAs increased by $1.0bn in 2020, and\nincluded the following movements:\n\n* a$9.7bn asset size decrease, largely driven by RWA\nreductions in CMB and GBM under our transformation\nprogramme. This was partly offset by lending growth and\nincreases in counterparty credit risk RWAs due to mark-to-\nmarket movements;\n\n* a$24.5bn increase in RWAs due to changes in asset quality,\nmostly in CMB and GBM. This was largely due to credit\nmigration in Asia, North America and Europe, partly offset by\ndecreases due to portfolio mix changes; and\n\n* a$14.2bn fall in RWAs due to changes in methodology and\npolicy, mostly in GBM and CMB. This included reductions\nunder management initiatives involving risk parameter\nrefinements, improved collateral linkage, and data\nenhancement, and changes under the CRR ‘Quick Fix’ relief\npackage. These reductions were partly offset by changes in\napproach to credit risk exposures.\n\nFrom a global business perspective, primarily in GBM and CMB,\nincreases from credit migration, lending growth, and market risk\nvolatility were mitigated by reductions of $51.5bn as a result of\nour transformation programme.\n\nHSBC Holdings ple Annual Report and Accounts 2020 83\n\nM@IAOI [eIOURUL4\n", "vlm_text": "Balance sheet commentary compared with  31 December 2019 \nAt 31 December 2020, our total assets were  $\\S3.0\\uphbar$  , an increase of   $\\S269$  bn or   $10\\%$   on a reported basis and  $\\S200{\\mathfrak{b}}{\\mathfrak{n}}$   or   $7\\%$   on a  constant currency basis.  \nThe increase in total assets primarily reflected growth in cash  balances, derivative assets and financial investments. \nOn a reported basis, our ratio of customer advances to customer  accounts was  $63.2\\%$  , compared with   $72.0\\%$   at 31 December 2019,  mainly due to growth in customer accounts. \nAssets \nCash and balances at central banks  increased by  $\\mathbb{S}150\\mathsf{b n}$   or   $98\\%$  , mainly in the UK, France, Hong Kong and North America, as  a result of deposit inflows and an increase in the commercial  surplus. \nTrading assets  decreased by  $\\S22{\\mathfrak{b}}{\\mathfrak{n}}$   or  $9\\%$  , notably from a  reduction in debt securities held, along with a reduction in bond  positions previously used for hedging purposes. \nDerivative assets  increased by \\$65bn or  $27\\%$  , primarily in the  UK, France and Hong Kong, reflecting favourable revaluation  movements on interest rate contracts as interest rates fell in most  major markets.

Despite significant  growth in these businesses in the first quarter of 2020 from  customers drawing down on credit facilities, balances  subsequently reduced as customers made repayments in part due  to the uncertain economic outlook. \nIn GBM, lower lending was mainly from decreases in term lending  in Asia, Europe and the US, and also from a decrease in overdrafts  in Europe.  \nIn CMB, the decrease in customer lending reflected a reduction in  other lending and overdrafts in Asia and North America. In Europe,  lending remained relatively flat as lower other lending and  overdrafts were almost entirely offset by a rise in term lending.  \nIn WPB, lending increased by  $\\S14\\mathsf{b n}$   or  $3\\%$  , notably from  mortgage growth in the UK (up \\$12bn) and in Hong Kong (up   $\\S5{\\mathfrak{b}}{\\mathfrak{n}})$  ).

Tensions span a wide range of issues, including trade,\nfinance, military, technology and human rights. The Covid-19\noutbreak has accelerated US and Chinese efforts to reduce mutual\ndependence in strategic industries such as sensitive technology,\npharmaceuticals and precursor chemicals.\n\nA range of tensions in US-China relations could have potential\nramifications for the Group and its customers. These tensions\ncould include divisions over Hong Kong, US funding of and trading\nwith strategic Chinese industries and claims of human rights\nviolations. Some of these tensions have manifested themselves\nthrough actions taken by the governments of the US and China in\n2020 and early 2021. These tensions may affect the Group through\nthe impact of sanctions, including the impact of sanctions on\ncustomers, and could result in regulatory, reputational and market\nrisks for the Group.\n\nThe US has imposed a range of sanctions and trade restrictions on\nChinese persons and companies, focusing on entities the US\nbelieves are involved in human rights violations, information\ntechnology and communications equipment and services, and\nmilitary activities, among others. In response, China has\nannounced a number of sanctions and trade restrictions that\ntarget or provide authority to target foreign officials and\ncompanies, including those in the US. Certain measures are of\nparticular relevance.\n\nThe US Hong Kong Autonomy Act provides ‘secondary sanctions’\nauthority that allows for the imposition of US sanctions against\nnon-US financial institutions found to be engaged in significant\ntransactions with certain Chinese individuals and entities subject\nto US sanctions as a result of a US determination that these\nindividuals or entities engaged in activities undermining Hong\nKong’s autonomy. The US has also imposed restrictions on US\npersons’ ability to engage in transactions in or relating to publicly\ntraded securities of a number of prominent Chinese companies.\nChina has subsequently adopted regulations providing a\nframework for specific prohibitions against compliance with, and\nprivate rights of action for damages resulting from, measures that\nthe government determines have an unjustified extraterritorial\napplication that impairs Chinese sovereignty.\n\nNo penalties have yet been imposed against financial institutions\nunder any of these measures, and their scope and application\nremain uncertain. These and any future measures that may be\ntaken by the US and China may affect the Group, its customers,\nand the markets in which we operate.\n\nIt remains unclear the extent to which the new US administration\nwill affect the current geopolitical tensions, following the\ninauguration of President Biden on 20 January 2021. However,\nlong-term differences between the two nations will likely remain,\nwhich could affect sentiment and restrict global economic activity.\nWe continue to monitor the situation.\n\nWhile UK-China relations have historically been shaped by strong\ntrade and investment, there are also emerging challenges.\nFollowing China's implementation of the Hong Kong national\nsecurity law, the UK offered residency rights and a path to\ncitizenship to eligible British National (Overseas) passport holders\nin Hong Kong. In addition, both the UK and Hong Kong\ngovernments have suspended their extradition treaties with each\nother.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions rise, the compliance by multinational\ncorporations with their legal or regulatory obligations in one\njurisdiction may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives\nof that jurisdiction over another, creating additional reputational\nand political risks for the Group. We maintain an open dialogue\nwith our regulators on the impact of legal and regulatory\nobligations on HSBC's business and customers.\n\nChina’s expanding data privacy and cybersecurity laws could pose\npotential challenges to intra-group data sharing, especially within\nthe Greater Bay Area.

The closure of borders threatened medical and food supplies for  many markets, leading to countries and territories focusing efforts  on building resilient supply chains closer to home. The Covid-19  outbreak and corresponding vaccine roll-out will likely dominate  the political and economic agenda for most of 2021.  \nTensions could increase as countries compete for access to the  array of vaccines either under development, approved or pending  approval, while the potential differences of protection offered by  vaccines, and the speed and scale with which they can be  manufactured and distributed may further add to tensions. \n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak also heightened existing US-China  tensions. Tensions span a wide range of issues, including trade,  finance, military, technology and human rights. The Covid-19  outbreak has accelerated US and Chinese efforts to reduce mutual  dependence in strategic industries such as sensitive technology,  pharmaceuticals and precursor chemicals.  \nA range of tensions in US-China relations could have potential  ramifications for the Group and its customers. These tensions  could include divisions over Hong Kong, US funding of and trading  with strategic Chinese industries and claims of human rights  violations. Some of these tensions have manifested themselves  through actions taken by the governments of the US and China in  2020 and early 2021. These tensions may affect the Group through  the impact of sanctions, including the impact of sanctions on  customers, and could result in regulatory, reputational and market  risks for the Group. \nThe US has imposed a range of sanctions and trade restrictions on  Chinese persons and companies, focusing on entities the US  believes are involved in human rights violations, information  technology and communications equipment and services, and  military activities, among others. In response, China has  announced a number of sanctions and trade restrictions that  target or provide authority to target foreign officials and  companies, including those in the US. Certain measures are of  particular relevance. \nThe US Hong Kong Autonomy Act provides 'secondary sanctions’  authority that allows for the imposition of US sanctions against  non-US financial institutions found to be engaged in significant  transactions with certain Chinese individuals and entities subject  to US sanctions as a result of a US determination that these  individuals or entities engaged in activities undermining Hong  Kong’s autonomy. The US has also imposed restrictions on US  persons’ ability to engage in transactions in or relating to publicly  traded securities of a number of prominent Chinese companies.  China has subsequently adopted regulations providing a  framework for specific prohibitions against compliance with, and  private rights of action for damages resulting from, measures that  the government determines have an unjustified extraterritorial  application that impairs Chinese sovereignty.   \nNo penalties have yet been imposed against financial institutions  under any of these measures, and their scope and application  remain uncertain. These and any future measures that may be  taken by the US and China may affect the Group, its customers,  and the markets in which we operate. \nIt remains unclear the extent to which the new US administration  will affect the current geopolitical tensions, following the  inauguration of President Biden on 20 January 2021. However,  long-term differences between the two nations will likely remain,  which could affect sentiment and restrict global economic activity.  We continue to monitor the situation. \nWhile UK-China relations have historically been shaped by strong  trade and investment, there are also emerging challenges.  Following China’s implementation of the Hong Kong national  security law, the UK offered residency rights and a path to  citizenship to eligible British National (Overseas) passport holders  in Hong Kong. In addition, both the UK and Hong Kong  governments have suspended their extradition treaties with each  other.  \nAs geopolitical tensions rise, the compliance by multinational  corporations with their legal or regulatory obligations in one  jurisdiction may be seen as supporting the law or policy objectives  of that jurisdiction over another, creating additional reputational  and political risks for the Group. We maintain an open dialogue  with our regulators on the impact of legal and regulatory  obligations on HSBC's business and customers. \nChina’s expanding data privacy and cybersecurity laws could pose  potential challenges to intra-group data sharing, especially within  the Greater Bay Area.

As a\nresult, industry-led national working groups are actively discussing\nthe mechanisms for an orderly transition of five Libor currencies,\nfour Asia-Pacific benchmarks that reference US dollar Libor, the\nEuro Overnight Index Average (’Eonia’), the Singapore interbank\noffered rate (‘Sibor’), and the Turkish Lira interbank offered rate\n(‘TRLibor’) to their chosen replacement rates.\n\nThe transition process away from Ibors, including the transition of\nlegacy contracts that reference Ibors, exposes HSBC to material\nexecution risks, and increases some financial and non-financial\nrisks.\n\nAs our lbor transition programme progresses into the execution\nphase, resilience and operational risks are heightened. This is due\nto an expected increase in the number of new near risk-free rate\n(‘RFR’) products being rolled out, compressed timelines for the\ntransition of legacy Ibor contracts and the extensive systems and\nprocess changes required to facilitate both new products and the\ntransition. This is being exacerbated by the current interest rate\nenvironment where low Libor rates, in comparison with\nreplacement RFRs, could affect decisions to transition contracts\nearly, further compressing transition timelines. Regulatory\ncompliance, legal and conduct risks may also increase as a result\nof both the continued sale of products referencing Ibors, and the\nsale of new products referencing RFRs, principally due to the lack\nof established market conventions across the different RFR\nproducts, and the compressed timelines for transition.\n\nFinancial risks resulting from the discontinuation of Ibors and the\ndevelopment of market liquidity in RFRs will also affect HSBC\nthroughout transition. The differences in Ibor and RFR interest\nrates will create a basis risk that we need to actively manage\nthrough appropriate financial hedging.

The Covid-19 outbreak and the\ninterest-rate environment may have affected clients’ abilities to\ntransition early, and has resulted in compressed timelines for the\ntransition of legacy Ibor contracts. However, for some US dollar\nLibor legacy contracts, this timing risk may be mitigated in part by\nthe recent announcement by the Libor benchmark administrator,\nICE Benchmark Administration Limited (‘IBA’), to consult on\nextending the publication of overnight and one, three, six and 12\nmonth US dollar Libor settings to 30 June 2023. Despite the\nproposed extension, regulatory and industry guidance has been\nclear that market participants should cease writing new US dollar\nLibor contracts as soon as is practicable, and in any event by the\nend of 2021 for the majority of products. While the extended\ndeadline will result in additional US dollar Libor transactions\nmaturing before cessation, not all of them will, so it is possible\nthat other proposed solutions, including legislative relief, will still\nbe needed.\n\nThe Group continues to have Ibor and Eonia derivatives, loan and\nbond exposures maturing beyond 2021.\n\nFor the derivatives exposures, HSBC's main trading entities have\nadhered to the adoption of the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association (‘ISDA’) protocol as a fallback provision,\nwhich came into effect in January 2021, and the successful\nchanges made by clearing houses to discount derivatives using\nthe euro short-term rate (‘€STR’) and SOFR, to reduce the risk of a\ndisorderly transition of the derivatives market.\n\nFor HSBC's loan book, our global businesses have developed\ncommercial strategies that include active client engagement and\ncommunication, providing detailed information on RFR products to\ndetermine our clients’ abilities to transition to a suitable alternative\nrate or replacement RFR product, before Ibor cessation.\n\nWith respect to HSBC's legacy bond issuances referencing Ibors\nthat may be subject to demise, we continue to assess the terms of\nthose bond issuances and a variety of transition options, with a\nview to implementing, through 2021 and beyond, transition plans\nthat we expect to be value neutral and in line with market practice.\nThe timing of that implementation will depend on a variety of\nfactors, including the expected timing for the demise of the\nrelevant lbor rate. The success of these transition plans will, to a\ncertain extent, also depend on the participation and engagement\nof third-party market participants. In addition, bond issuances that\nreference lbors by certain issuing entities in the Group also\nreduced during 2020, with such entities opting to issue bonds that\nreference RFRs such as Sonia and SOFR.

While the extended  deadline will result in additional US dollar Libor transactions  maturing before cessation, not all of them will, so it is possible  that other proposed solutions, including legislative relief, will still  be needed.  \nThe Group continues to have Ibor and Eonia derivatives, loan and  bond exposures maturing beyond 2021.  \nFor the derivatives exposures, HSBC’s main trading entities have  adhered to the adoption of the International Swaps and  Derivatives Association (‘ISDA’) protocol as a fallback provision,  which came into effect in January 2021, and the successful  changes made by clearing houses to discount derivatives using  the euro short-term rate (‘€STR’) and SOFR, to reduce the risk of a  disorderly transition of the derivatives market. \nFor HSBC’s loan book, our global businesses have developed  commercial strategies that include active client engagement and  communication, providing detailed information on RFR products to  determine our clients’ abilities to transition to a suitable alternative  rate or replacement RFR product, before Ibor cessation.  \nWith respect to HSBC’s legacy bond issuances referencing Ibors  that may be subject to demise, we continue to assess the terms of  those bond issuances and a variety of transition options, with a  view to implementing, through 2021 and beyond, transition plans  that we expect to be value neutral and in line with market practice.  The timing of that implementation will depend on a variety of  factors, including the expected timing for the demise of the  relevant Ibor rate. The success of these transition plans will, to a  certain extent, also depend on the participation and engagement  of third-party market participants.  In addition, bond issuances that  reference Ibors by certain issuing entities in the Group also  reduced during 2020, with such entities opting to issue bonds that  reference RFRs such as Sonia and SOFR. For those bonds where  HSBC is the paying agent, there remains dependence on  engagement of third-party market participants in the transition  process of their issued debt. "}

While considered under the themes captured\nunder top and emerging risks, in this section we have placed a\nparticular focus on the Covid-19 outbreak and the UK withdrawal\nfrom the EU.\n\nRisks related to Covid-19\n\nThe Covid-19 outbreak and its effect on the global economy have\nimpacted our customers and our performance, and the future\neffects of the outbreak remain uncertain. The outbreak\nnecessitated governments to respond at unprecedented levels to\nprotect public health, local economies and livelihoods. It has\naffected regions at different times and to varying degrees as it has\ndeveloped. The varying government support measures and\nrestrictions in response have added challenges, given the rapid\npace of change and significant operational demands. The speed at\nwhich countries and territories will be able to unwind the\ngovernment support measures and restrictions and return to pre-\nCovid-19 economic levels will vary based on the levels of infection,\nlocal governmental decisions and access to and ability to roll out\nvaccines. There remains a risk of subsequent waves of infection,\nas evidenced by the recently emerged more transmissible variants\nof the virus. Renewed outbreaks emphasise the ongoing threat of\nCovid-19 even in countries that have recorded lower than average\ncases so far.\n\nGovernment restrictions imposed around the world to limit the\nspread of Covid-19 resulted in a sharp contraction in global\neconomic activity during 2020. At the same time governments\nalso took steps designed to soften the extent of the damage to\ninvestment, trade and labour markets. Our Central scenario used\nto calculate impairment assumes that economic activity will\ngradually recover over the course of 2021. In this scenario,\nrecovery will be supported by a successful roll-out of vaccination\nprogrammes across our key markets, which, coupled with\neffective non-pharmacological measures to contain the virus, will\nlead to a decline in infections over the course of the year.\nGovernments and central banks are expected to continue to work\ntogether across many of our key markets to ensure that\nhouseholds and firms receive an appropriate level of financial\nsupport until restrictions on economic activity and mobility can be\nmaterially eased. Such support is intended to ensure that labour\nand housing markets do not experience abrupt, negative\ncorrections. It is also intended to limit the extent of long-term\nstructural damage to economies. There is a high degree of\nuncertainty associated with economic forecasts in the current\nenvironment and there are significant risks to our Central scenario.\nThe degree of uncertainty varies by market, driven by country-\nspecific trends in the evolution of the pandemic and associated\npolicy responses. As a result, our Central scenario for impairment\nhas not been assigned an equal likelihood of occurrence across\nour key markets. For further details of our Central and other\nscenarios see ‘Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis’\non page 127.\n\nThere is a material risk of a renewed drop in economic activity.\nThe economic fallout from the Covid-19 outbreak risks increasing\ninequality across markets that have already suffered from social\nunrest. This will leave the burden on governments and central\nbanks to maintain or increase fiscal and monetary stimulus. After\nfinancial markets suffered a sharp fall in the early phases of the\nspread of Covid-19, they rebounded but still remain volatile.\nDepending on the long-term impact on global economic growth,\nfinancial asset prices may suffer a further sharp fall.\n\nGovernments and central banks in major economies have\ndeployed extensive measures to support their local populations.\nMeasures implemented by governments have included income\nsupport to households and funding support to businesses. Central\nbank measures have included cuts to policy rates, support to\nfunding markets and asset purchases. These measures are being\nextended in countries where further waves of the Covid-19\noutbreak are prompting renewed government restrictions. Central\n\n116 HSBC Holdings ple Annual Report and Accounts 2020\n\nbanks are expected to maintain record-low interest rates for a\nconsiderable period of time and the debt burden of governments is\nexpected to rise significantly.\n\nWe initiated market-specific measures to support our personal and\nbusiness customers through these challenging times. These\nincluded mortgage assistance, payment holidays, the waiving of\ncertain fees and charges, and liquidity relief for businesses facing\nmarket uncertainty and supply chain disruption. We are also\nworking closely with governments, and supporting national\nschemes that focus on the parts of the economy most impacted\nby Covid-19. In the UK, this included providing access to the\nvarious government support schemes from the beginning. In Hong\nKong, we provided prompt liquidity relief to businesses facing\nmarket uncertainty and supply chain pressures. For further details\nof our customer relief programmes, see page 142.\n\nCentral bank and government actions and support measures taken\nin response to the Covid-19 outbreak, and our responses to those,\nhave created, and may in the future create restrictions in relation\nto capital. This has limited and may in the future limit\nmanagement's flexibility in managing the business and taking\naction in relation to capital distribution and capital allocation. For\nexample, in response to a written request from the PRA, we\ncancelled the fourth interim dividend for 2019 of $0.21 per\nordinary share. We also announced that we would make no\nquarterly or interim dividend payments or accruals in respect of\nordinary shares until the end of 2020. Following this, in December\n2020 the PRA announced a temporary approach to shareholder\ndistributions for 2020 in which it set out a framework for board\ndecisions on dividends. After considering the requirements of the\ntemporary approach, the Board announced an interim dividend for\n2020 of $0.15 per ordinary share.\n\nThe rapid introduction and varying nature of the government\nsupport schemes, as well as customer expectations, has led to\nrisks as the Group implements large-scale changes in a short\nperiod of time. This has led to increased operational risks,\nincluding complex conduct considerations, increased reputational\nrisk and increased risk of fraud. These risks are likely to be\nheightened further as and when those government support\nschemes are unwound. Central bank and government actions and\nsupport measures, and our responses to those, have also led to\nincreased litigation risk, including lawsuits that have been and\nmay continue to be brought in connection with our cancellation of\nthe fourth interim dividend for 2019.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, our CET1 ratio was 15.9%, compared with\n14.7% at 31 December 2019, and our liquidity coverage ratio\n(‘LCR’) was 139%. Our capital, funding and liquidity position is\nexpected to help us to continue supporting our customers\nthroughout the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nIn many of our markets the Covid-19 outbreak has led to a\nworsening of economic conditions and increased uncertainty,\nwhich has been reflected in higher ECL reserves. Furthermore,\ncredit losses may increase due to exposure to vulnerable sectors\nof the economy such as retail, hospitality and commercial real\nestate. The impact of the pandemic on the long-term prospects of\nbusinesses in these sectors is uncertain and may lead to\nsignificant credit losses on specific exposures, which may not be\nfully captured in ECL estimates. In addition, in times of stress,\nfraudulent activity is often more prevalent, leading to potentially\nsignificant credit or operational losses.\n\nThe significant changes in economic and market drivers, customer\nbehaviours and government actions caused by Covid-19 have\nmaterially impacted the performance of financial models. ECL\nmodel performance has been significantly impacted, which has\nincreased reliance on management judgement in determining the\nappropriate level of ECL estimates. The reliability of ECL models\nunder these circumstances has also been impacted by the\nunprecedented response from governments to provide a variety of\neconomic stimulus packages to support livelihoods and\nbusinesses. Historical observations on which the models were\nbuilt do not reflect these unprecedented support measures.

While this reduced\nthe reliance on management judgement for determining ECL\nestimates, the current uncertain economic outlook, coupled with\nthe expected end to government support schemes, resulted in\njudgemental post-model adjustments still being required. The\nModel Risk Management team is reviewing IFRS 9 model\nperformance at the country and Group level on a quarterly basis to\nassess whether or not the models in place can deliver reliable\noutputs.\n\nThese assessments provide the credit teams with a view of model\nreliability.

A continued prolonged period of significantly reduced\neconomic activity as a result of the impact of the outbreak could\nhave a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results\nof operations, prospects, liquidity, capital position and credit\nratings. We continue to monitor the situation closely, and given\nthe novel or prolonged nature of the outbreak, additional\nmitigating actions may be required.\n\nUK withdrawal from the European Union\n\nThe UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered a transition\nperiod until 31 December 2020. A Trade and Cooperation\nAgreement between the EU and the UK was agreed on\n\n24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK on 30 December 2020. It\nincludes a joint declaration of cooperation, and in the coming\nmonths both parties are expected to enter discussions with the\naim of agreeing a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the\nframework for this cooperation. As expected, the financial\npassporting arrangement expired at the end of the transition\nperiod, and therefore financial institutions in the UK including\nHSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK lost their EU regulatory permissions\nto continue servicing clients in the European Economic Area\n(‘EEA’) from 1 January 2021. The Trade and Cooperation\nAgreement mainly focused on goods and services but also\ncovered a wide range of other areas, including competition, state\naid, tax, fisheries, transport, data and security. However, it\nincluded limited elements on financial services, and, as a result,\ndid not change HSBC's planning in relation to the UK’s withdrawal\nfrom the EU.\n\nOur programme to manage the impact of the UK withdrawal from\nthe EU has now been largely completed. It was based on the\nassumption of a scenario whereby the UK exits the transition\nperiod without the financial passporting or regulatory equivalence\nframework that supports cross-border business.\n\nEquivalence decisions are an established feature of EU law, which\nallow the authorities in the UK and EU to rely on the other's\nregime for specific regulatory purposes only. While the UK and the\nEU have made a number of equivalence decisions, these decisions\ndo not give UK firms full access to EU clients and counterparties.\n\nOur programme focused on four main components: legal entity\nrestructuring; product offering; customer migrations; and\nemployees. However, there remain risks, many of them linked to\nthe absence of some equivalence decisions between the EU and\nthe UK.\n\nWe have carried out detailed reviews of our credit portfolios to\ndetermine those sectors and customers most vulnerable to the\nUK's exit from the EU and will continue to monitor any\nimplications for our clients in adhering to the new requirements\nunder the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.\n\nLegal entity restructuring\n\nOur branches in seven EEA countries (Belgium, the Netherlands,\nLuxembourg, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Czech Republic) relied on\nfinancial passporting out of the UK. We had worked on the\nassumption that this passporting would no longer be possible\nfollowing the UK's withdrawal from the EU and therefore\ntransferred our branch business to newly established branches of\nHSBC Continental Europe, our primary banking entity authorised\nin the EU. This was completed in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nProduct offering\n\nTo accommodate customer migrations and new business after the\nUK's departure from the EU, we expanded our product offering in\na wide range of areas such as in our Markets and Securities\nServices franchise as well as in our Global Trade Business. We\nalso enhanced our cash management solutions in France, the\nNetherlands and Ireland. We also opened a new branch in\nStockholm to service our customers in the Nordic region.\n\nCustomer migrations\n\nThe UK’s withdrawal from the EU has had an impact on our\nclients’ operating models, including their working capital\nrequirements, investment decisions and financial markets\ninfrastructure access. Our priority is to provide continuity of\nservice, and while our intention was to minimise the level of\nchange for our customers, we were required to migrate some\nEEA-incorporated clients from the UK to HSBC Continental Europe\nor another EEA entity. We have now migrated almost all clients\nwho we expect can no longer be serviced out of the UK. The\nmajority of remaining customers are covered by national regimes\nthat allow continuity of financial services on a temporary or\npermanent basis between the UK and their respective jurisdictions.\nWe are working in close collaboration with our customers with the\naim of managing their transition in 2021, where required.\n\nMOIAOI 1SIY\n\nEmployees\n\nThe migration of EEA-incorporated clients required us to\nstrengthen our local teams in the EU, and France in particular. We\nhave now completed the transfer of roles from London to Paris to\nsupport our post-UK withdrawal from the EU operating model.\n\nLooking beyond the transfer of roles to the EU, we are also\nproviding support to our employees who are UK citizens resident\nin EEA countries, and employees who are citizens of an EU\nmember state resident in the UK, for example on settlement\napplications.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2020 117\n", "vlm_text": "In order to address some model limitations and performance  issues, we redeveloped some of the key models used to calculate  ECL estimates.

We continue to monitor the situation closely, and given  the novel or prolonged nature of the outbreak, additional  mitigating actions may be required. \nUK withdrawal from the European Union \nThe UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and entered a transition  period until 31 December 2020. A Trade and Cooperation  Agreement between the EU and the UK was agreed on  24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK on 30 December 2020. It  includes a joint declaration of cooperation, and in the coming  months both parties are expected to enter discussions with the  aim of agreeing a Memorandum of Understanding establishing the  framework for this cooperation. As expected, the financial  passporting arrangement expired at the end of the transition  period, and therefore financial institutions in the UK including  HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK lost their EU regulatory permissions  to continue servicing clients in the European Economic Area  (‘EEA’) from 1 January 2021. The Trade and Cooperation  Agreement mainly focused on goods and services but also  covered a wide range of other areas, including competition, state  aid, tax, fisheries, transport, data and security. However, it  included limited elements on financial services, and, as a result,  did not change HSBC’s planning in relation to the UK’s withdrawal  from the EU.  \nOur programme focused on four main components: legal entity  restructuring; product offering; customer migrations; and  employees. However, there remain risks, many of them linked to  the absence of some equivalence decisions between the EU and  the UK.\nWe have carried out detailed reviews of our credit portfolios to  determine those sectors and customers most vulnerable to the  UK’s exit from the EU and will continue to monitor any  implications for our clients in adhering to the new requirements  under the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.  \nLegal entity restructuring \nOur branches in seven EEA countries (Belgium, the Netherlands,  Luxembourg, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Czech Republic) relied on  financial passporting out of the UK. We had worked on the  assumption that this passporting would no longer be possible  following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU and therefore  transferred our branch business to newly established branches of  HSBC Continental Europe, our primary banking entity authorised  in the EU. This was completed in the first quarter of 2019. \nProduct offering \nTo accommodate customer migrations and new business after the  UK’s departure from the EU, we expanded our product offering in  a wide range of areas such as in our Markets and Securities  Services franchise as well as in our Global Trade Business. We  also enhanced our cash management solutions in France, the  Netherlands and Ireland. We also opened a new branch in  Stockholm to service our customers in the Nordic region.  \nCustomer migrations \nThe UK’s withdrawal from the EU has had an impact on our  clients’ operating models, including their working capital  requirements, investment decisions and financial markets  infrastructure access. Our priority is to provide continuity of  service, and while our intention was to minimise the level of  change for our customers, we were required to migrate some  EEA-incorporated clients from the UK to HSBC Continental Europe  or another EEA entity. We have now migrated almost all clients  who we expect can no longer be serviced out of the UK. The  majority of remaining customers are covered by national regimes  that allow continuity of financial services on a temporary or  permanent basis between the UK and their respective jurisdictions.  We are working in close collaboration with our customers with the  aim of managing their transition in 2021, where required. \nEmployees \nThe migration of EEA-incorporated clients required us to  strengthen our local teams in the EU, and France in particular. We  have now completed the transfer of roles from London to Paris to  support our post-UK withdrawal from the EU operating model.  \nLooking beyond the transfer of roles to the EU, we are also  providing support to our employees who are UK citizens resident  in EEA countries, and employees who are citizens of an EU  member state resident in the UK, for example on settlement  applications. \nOur programme to manage the impact of the UK withdrawal from  the EU has now been largely completed. It was based on the  assumption of a scenario whereby the UK exits the transition  period without the financial passporting or regulatory equivalence  framework that supports cross-border business. \nEquivalence decisions are an established feature of EU law, which  allow the authorities in the UK and EU to rely on the other’s  regime for specific regulatory purposes only. While the UK and the  EU have made a number of equivalence decisions, these decisions  do not give UK firms full access to EU clients and counterparties. "}

A new and more contagious strain of the\nvirus increased the transmission rate in the UK and resulted in\nstringent restrictions to mobility towards the end of 2020. This\nviral strain observed in the UK, together with aggressive strains\nobserved in other countries including South Africa and Brazil,\nintroduce the risk that transmission may increase significantly\nwithin the national borders of a number of countries in 2021 and\nalso raise concerns around the efficacy of vaccines as the virus\nmutates. Some countries may keep significant restrictions to\nmobility in place for an extended period of time and at least until\ncritical segments of the population can be inoculated. Further risks\nto international travel also arise.\n\nA number of vaccines have been developed and approved for use\nat a rapid pace and plans to inoculate significant proportions of\nnational populations in 2021 across many of our key markets are a\nclear positive for economic recovery. While we expect vaccination\nprogrammes to be successful, governments and healthcare\nauthorities face country-specific challenges that could affect the\nspeed and spread of vaccinations. These challenges include the\nlogistics of inoculating a significant proportion of national\npopulations within a limited timeframe and the public acceptance\nof vaccines. On a global level, supply challenges could affect the\npace of roll-out and the efficacy of vaccines is yet to be\ndetermined.\n\nGovernment support programmes in advanced economies in 2020\nwere supported by accommodative actions taken by central\nbanks. These measures by governments and central banks have\nprovided households and firms with significant support. An\ninability or unwillingness to continue with such support or the\nuntimely withdrawal of support present a downside risk to growth.\n\nWhile Covid-19 and related risks dominate the economic outlook,\ngeopolitical risks also present a threat. These risks include:\n\nMOIAOI 1SIY\n\n* Continued long-term differences between the US and China,\nwhich could affect sentiment and restrict global economic\nactivity.\n\n¢ The Covid-19 outbreak reduced the incidence of protests in\nHong Kong. Despite the passage of the national security law in\n2020, such unrest has the potential to return as the virus abates\nand restrictions to mobility ease.\n\ne¢ The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU\naverted a disorderly UK departure from the EU, but the risk of\nfuture disagreements remains, which may hinder the ability to\nreach a more comprehensive agreement on trade and services.\n\nThe consensus Downside scenario\n\nIn the consensus Downside scenario, economic recovery is\nconsiderably weaker compared with the Central scenario. GDP\ngrowth remains weak, unemployment rates stay elevated and\nasset and commodity prices fall before gradually recovering\ntowards their long-run trends.\n\nThe scenario is consistent with the key downside risks articulated\nabove.

These include the orderly and rapid global abatement of  Covid-19 via successful containment and prompt deployment of a  vaccine; de-escalation of tensions between the US and China; de- escalation of political tensions in Hong Kong; continued support  from fiscal and monetary policy and smooth relations between the  UK and the EU, which enables the two parties to swiftly reach a  comprehensive agreement on trade and services.  \nThe following table describes key macroeconomic variables and  the probabilities assigned in the consensus Upside scenario. \nThe table shows economic indicators for various countries, including:\n\n1. **GDP growth rate (%)** with timeframes indicated in parentheses.\n2. **Unemployment rate (%)** with years mentioned.\n3. **House price growth (%)** with years.\n4. **Short-term interest rate (%)** with years.\n5. **Probability consensus Upside**, with a numeric value for each country.\n\nThe countries listed are the UK, US, Hong Kong, Mainland China, Canada, France, UAE, and Mexico.\nDownside scenarios \nThe year 2021 is expected to be a period of economic recovery,  but the progression and management of the pandemic presents a  key risk to global growth. A new and more contagious strain of the  virus increased the transmission rate in the UK and resulted in  stringent restrictions to mobility towards the end of 2020. This  viral strain observed in the UK, together with aggressive strains  observed in other countries including South Africa and Brazil,  introduce the risk that transmission may increase significantly  within the national borders of a number of countries in 2021 and  also raise concerns around the efficacy of vaccines as the virus  mutates. Some countries may keep significant restrictions to  mobility in place for an extended period of time and at least until  critical segments of the population can be inoculated. Further risks  to international travel also arise. \nA number of vaccines have been developed and approved for use  at a rapid pace and plans to inoculate significant proportions of  national populations in 2021 across many of our key markets are a  clear positive for economic recovery. While we expect vaccination  programmes to be successful, governments and healthcare  authorities face country-specific challenges that could affect the  speed and spread of vaccinations. These challenges include the  logistics of inoculating a significant proportion of national  populations within a limited timeframe and the public acceptance  of vaccines. On a global level, supply challenges could affect the  pace of roll-out and the efficacy of vaccines is yet to be  determined. \n• Continued long-term differences between the US and China, which could affect sentiment and restrict global economic activity.\n\n • The Covid-19 outbreak reduced the incidence of protests in Hong Kong. Despite the passage of the national security law in 2020, such unrest has the potential to return as the virus abates and restrictions to mobility ease.\n\n • The Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the UK and EU averted a disorderly UK departure from the EU, but the risk of future disagreements remains, which may hinder the ability to reach a more comprehensive agreement on trade and services. \nThe consensus Downside scenario \nIn the consensus Downside scenario, economic recovery is  considerably weaker compared with the Central scenario. GDP  growth remains weak, unemployment rates stay elevated and  asset and commodity prices fall before gradually recovering  towards their long-run trends.  \nThe scenario is consistent with the key downside risks articulated  above. Further outbreaks of Covid-19, coupled with delays in  vaccination programmes, lead to longer-lasting restrictions on  economic activity in this scenario. Other global risks also increase  and drive increased risk-aversion in asset markets.  \nGovernment support programmes in advanced economies in 2020  were supported by accommodative actions taken by central  banks. These measures by governments and central banks have  provided households and firms with significant support. An  inability or unwillingness to continue with such support or the  untimely withdrawal of support present a downside risk to growth. \nWhile Covid-19 and related risks dominate the economic outlook,  geopolitical risks also present a threat. These risks include:  "}

The level of estimation  uncertainty and judgement has increased during 2020 as a result  of the economic effects of the Covid-19 outbreak, including  significant judgements relating to: \n\n \n• the selection and weighting of economic scenarios, given rapidly changing economic conditions in an unprecedented manner, uncertainty as to the effect of government and central bank support measures designed to alleviate adverse economic impacts, and a wider distribution of economic forecasts than before the pandemic. The key judgements are the length of time over which the economic effects of the pandemic will occur, the speed and shape of recovery. The main factors include the effectiveness of pandemic containment measures, the pace of roll-out and effectiveness of vaccines, and the emergence of new variants of the virus, plus a range of geopolitical uncertainties, which together represent a very high degree of estimation uncertainty, particularly in assessing Downside scenarios;\n\n \n• estimating the economic effects of those scenarios on ECL, where there is no observable historical trend that can be reflected in the models that will accurately represent the effects of the economic changes of the severity and speed brought about by the Covid-19 outbreak. Modelled assumptions and linkages between economic factors and credit losses may  underestimate or overestimate ECL in these conditions, and  there is significant uncertainty in the estimation of parameters  such as collateral values and loss severity; and \n\n• the identification of customers experiencing significant increases in credit risk and credit impairment, particularly where those customers have accepted payment deferrals and other reliefs designed to address short-term liquidity issues given muted default experience to date. The use of segmentation techniques for indicators of significant increases in credit risk involves significant estimation uncertainty. \nHow economic scenarios are reflected in ECL  calculations \nModels are used to reflect economic scenarios on ECL estimates.  As described above, modelled assumptions and linkages based on  historical information could not alone produce relevant information  under the unprecedented conditions experienced in 2020, and it  was necessary to place greater emphasis on judgemental  adjustments to modelled outcomes than in previous years.    \nWe have developed globally consistent methodologies for the  application of forward economic guidance into the calculation of  ECL for wholesale and retail credit risk. These standard  approaches are described below, followed by the management  judgemental adjustments made, including those to reflect the  circumstances experienced in 2020.    \nFor wholesale, a global methodology is used for the estimation of  the term structure of probability of default (‘PD’) and loss given  default (‘LGD’). For PDs, we consider the correlation of forward  economic guidance to default rates for a particular industry in a  country. For LGD calculations, we consider the correlation of  forward economic guidance to collateral values and realisation  rates for a particular country and industry. PDs and LGDs are  estimated for the entire term structure of each instrument.  \nFor impaired loans, LGD estimates take into account independent  recovery valuations provided by external consultants where  available or internal forecasts corresponding to anticipated  economic conditions and individual company conditions. In  estimating the ECL on impaired loans that are individually  considered not to be significant, we incorporate forward economic  guidance proportionate to the probability-weighted outcome and  the Central scenario outcome for non-stage 3 populations. \nFor retail, the impact of economic scenarios on PD is modelled at  a portfolio level. Historical relationships between observed default  rates and macroeconomic variables are integrated into IFRS 9 ECL  estimates by using economic response models. The impact of  these scenarios on PD is modelled over a period equal to the  remaining maturity of the underlying asset or assets. The impact  on LGD is modelled for mortgage portfolios by forecasting future  loan-to-value (‘LTV’) profiles for the remaining maturity of the  asset by using national level forecasts of the house price index and  applying the corresponding LGD expectation. \nThese models are based largely on historical observations and  correlations with default rates. Management judgemental  adjustments are described below. \nManagement judgemental adjustments \nIn the context of IFRS 9, management judgemental adjustments  are short-term increases or decreases to the ECL at either a  customer or portfolio level to account for late-breaking events,  model and data limitations and deficiencies, and expert credit  judgement applied following management review and challenge.  In the  Annual Report and Accounts 2019 , these were ‘Post-model  adjustments’. \nThe most severe projections at 31 December 2020 of  macroeconomic variables are outside the historical observations  on which IFRS 9 models have been built and calibrated to operate.  Moreover, the complexities of country-specific governmental  support programmes, the impacts on customer behaviours and  the unpredictable pathways of the pandemic have never been  modelled. Consequently, HSBC’s IFRS 9 models, in some cases,  generate outputs that appear overly sensitive when compared  with other economic and credit metrics. Governmental support  programmes and customer payment reliefs have dislocated the  correlation between economic conditions and defaults on which  models are based. Management judgemental adjustments are  required to help ensure that an appropriate amount of ECL  impairment is recognised. "}

The composition of modelled ECL and management\njudgemental adjustments changed significantly over 2020 as\ncertain economic measures, such as GDP growth rate, passed the\nexpected low point in a number of key markets and returned\ntowards those reflected in modelled relationships, subject to\ncontinued uncertainty in the recovery paths of different\neconomies.\n\nAt 31 December 2020, wholesale management judgemental\nadjustments were an ECL reduction of $0.2bn (31 December 2019:\n$0.1bn increase).

Considerations\n\n132 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2020\n\ninclude potential default suppression in some sectors due to\ngovernment intervention and late-breaking idiosyncratic\ndevelopments.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, retail management judgemental\nadjustments led to an ECL increase of $1.5bn, primarily from\nadditional ECL of $1.9bn to reflect adjustments to the timing of\ndefault, which has been delayed by government support and\ncustomer relief measures. This was partly offset by adjustments to\nretail lending PD outputs, to reduce ECL of $0.8bn for unintuitive\nmodel responses, primarily where economic forecasts were\nbeyond the bounds of the model development period. Other retail\nlending adjustments of $0.4bn led to an increase in ECL from\nareas such as customer relief and data limitations.\n\nThe retail model default suppression adjustment was applied as\ndefaults remain temporarily suppressed due to government\nsupport and customer relief programmes, which have supported\nstabilised portfolio performance. Retail models are reliant on the\nassumption that as macroeconomic conditions deteriorate,\ndefaults will crystallise. This adjustment aligns the increase in\ndefault due to changes in economic conditions to the period of\ntime when defaults are expected to be observed. The retail model\ndefault suppression adjustment will be monitored and updated\nprospectively to ensure appropriate alignment with expected\nperformance taking into consideration the levels and timing of\ngovernment support and customer relief programmes.\n\nRetail lending PD adjustments are primarily related to an\nadjustment made in relation to the UK. The downside\nunemployment forecasts were outside the historical bounds on\nwhich the model was developed resulting in unintuitive levels of\nPD. This adjustment reduced the sensitivity of PD to better align\nwith the historical correlation between changes in levels of\nunemployment and defaults.\n\nEconomic scenarios sensitivity analysis of ECL\nestimates\n\nManagement considered the sensitivity of the ECL outcome\nagainst the economic forecasts as part of the ECL governance\nprocess by recalculating the ECL under each scenario described\nabove for selected portfolios, applying a 100% weighting to each\nscenario in turn. The weighting is reflected in both the\ndetermination of a significant increase in credit risk and the\nmeasurement of the resulting ECL.\n\nThe ECL calculated for the Upside and Downside scenarios should\nnot be taken to represent the upper and lower limits of possible\nECL outcomes. The impact of defaults that might occur in the\nfuture under different economic scenarios is captured by\nrecalculating ECL for loans in stages 1 and 2 at the balance sheet\ndate. The population of stage 3 loans (in default) at the balance\nsheet date is unchanged in these sensitivity calculations. Stage 3\nECL would only be sensitive to changes in forecasts of future\neconomic conditions if the LGD of a particular portfolio was\nsensitive to these changes.\n\nThere is a particularly high degree of estimation uncertainty in\nnumbers representing tail risk scenarios when assigned a 100%\nweighting.\n\nFor wholesale credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis\nexcludes ECL and financial instruments related to defaulted\nobligors because the measurement of ECL is relatively more\nsensitive to credit factors specific to the obligor than future\neconomic scenarios. Therefore, it is impracticable to separate the\neffect of macroeconomic factors in individual assessments. For\nretail credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis includes ECL for\nloans and advances to customers related to defaulted obligors.\nThis is because the retail ECL for secured mortgage portfolios\nincluding loans in all stages is sensitive to macroeconomic\nvariables.\n\nWholesale and retail sensitivity\n\nThe wholesale and retail sensitivity analysis is stated inclusive of\nmanagement judgemental adjustments, as appropriate to each\nscenario.

Other retail  lending adjustments of  $\\S0.4$  bn led to an increase in ECL from  areas such as customer relief and data limitations.  \nThe retail model default suppression adjustment was applied as  defaults remain temporarily suppressed due to government  support and customer relief programmes, which have supported  stabilised portfolio performance. Retail models are reliant on the  assumption that as macroeconomic conditions deteriorate,  defaults will crystallise. This adjustment aligns the increase in  default due to changes in economic conditions to the period of  time when defaults are expected to be observed. The retail model  default suppression adjustment will be monitored and updated  prospectively to ensure appropriate alignment with expected  performance taking into consideration the levels and timing of  government support and customer relief programmes. \nRetail lending PD adjustments are primarily related to an  adjustment made in relation to the UK. The downside  unemployment forecasts were outside the historical bounds on  which the model was developed resulting in unintuitive levels of  PD. This adjustment reduced the sensitivity of PD to better align  with the historical correlation between changes in levels of  unemployment and defaults. \nEconomic scenarios sensitivity analysis of ECL  estimates \nManagement considered the sensitivity of the ECL outcome  against the economic forecasts as part of the ECL governance  process by recalculating the ECL under each scenario described  above for selected portfolios, applying a   $100\\%$   weighting to each  scenario in turn. The weighting is reflected in both the  determination of a significant increase in credit risk and the  measurement of the resulting ECL. \nThe ECL calculated for the Upside and Downside scenarios should  not be taken to represent the upper and lower limits of possible  ECL outcomes. The impact of defaults that might occur in the  future under different economic scenarios is captured by  recalculating ECL for loans in stages 1 and 2 at the balance sheet  date. The population of stage 3 loans (in default) at the balance  sheet date is unchanged in these sensitivity calculations. Stage 3  ECL would only be sensitive to changes in forecasts of future  economic conditions if the LGD of a particular portfolio was  sensitive to these changes. \nThere is a particularly high degree of estimation uncertainty in  numbers representing tail risk scenarios when assigned a   $100\\%$  weighting.  \nFor wholesale credit risk exposures, the sensitivity analysis  excludes ECL and financial instruments related to defaulted  obligors because the measurement of ECL is relatively more  sensitive to credit factors specific to the obligor than future  economic scenarios.

As such, the gross carrying value of debt instruments at FVOCI as presented above will not reconcile to the balance sheet as it\n\nexcludes fair value gains and losses.\n\nCredit-impaired loans\n(Audited)\n\nWe determine that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in\nstage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily\nwhether:\n\n* contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due\nfor more than 90 days;\n\n¢ there are other indications that the borrower is unlikely to pay,\nsuch as when a concession has been granted to the borrower\nfor economic or legal reasons relating to the borrower's\nfinancial condition; and\n\n¢ the loan is otherwise considered to be in default. If such\nunlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is\ndeemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due, even\nwhere regulatory rules permit default to be defined based on\n180 days past due.

If such  unlikeliness to pay is not identified at an earlier stage, it is  deemed to occur when an exposure is 90 days past due, even  where regulatory rules permit default to be defined based on  180 days past due. Therefore, the definitions of credit impaired  and default are aligned as far as possible so that stage 3  represents all loans that are considered defaulted or otherwise  credit impaired. \nRenegotiated loans and forbearance \nThe following table shows the gross carrying amounts of the  Group’s holdings of renegotiated loans and advances to  customers by industry sector and by stages.

On 2 September  2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority announced that this  scheme has been extended for a further six months to April 2021. \nUS wholesale lending \nPaycheck Protection Program \nThe CARES Act created the Paycheck Protection Program (‘PPP’)  loan guarantee programme to provide small businesses with  support to cover payroll and certain other expenses. Loans made  under the PPP are fully guaranteed by the Small Business  Administration, whose guarantee is backed by the full faith and  credit of the US. PPP-covered loans also afford customers  forgiveness up to the principal amount of the PPP-covered loan,  plus accrued interest, if the loan proceeds are used to retain  workers and maintain payroll or to make certain mortgage  interest, lease and utility payments, and certain other criteria are  satisfied. The Small Business Administration will reimburse PPP  lenders for any amount of a PPP-covered loan that is forgiven, and  PPP lenders will not be liable for any representations made by PPP  borrowers in connection with their requests for loan forgiveness.  Lenders receive pre-determined fees for processing and servicing  PPP loans.  \nHSBC-specific measures \nUK wholesale lending \nHSBC is offering capital repayment holidays to CMB customers.

The total is also provided.\n   - For example, for the Corporate and commercial category and CRR 3, under Stage 1, the amount is $131,540 million.\n\n4. **Allowance for ECL:**\n   - Expected credit loss allowances are reported for each stage and POCI, with a total allowance given.\n   - For instance, for CRR 3 under Corporate and commercial, the allowance for Stage 1 is $(262) million.\n\n5. **ECL Coverage %:**\n   - This represents the percentage of allowance relative to the total gross carrying amount for each CRR.\n   - For CRR 3 under Corporate and commercial, ECL coverage is 0.3%.\n\n6. **Mapped External Rating:**\n   - Each CRR is mapped to a corresponding external credit rating range.\n   - For example, CRR 3 is mapped to 'BBB+ to BBB-'.\n\n7. **Total at the end:**\n   - At the bottom, the totals are provided for the gross carrying amount ($673,326 million) and allowance for ECL ($9,801 million) as of 31 Dec 2020.\n\nThis table provides a comprehensive view of credit risk exposure, anticipated losses, and credit quality mapping for different borrower segments as of December 31, 2020.\nThe table presents a breakdown of credit risk ratings (CRR) and associated probabilities of default for three categories: \"Corporate and commercial,\" \"Non-bank financial institutions,\" and \"Banks,\" as of December 31, 2019. It details several CRR categories, each linked to a specific range of probabilities of default. \n\nFor each category, the table lists figures that appear to represent financial metrics, possibly amounts in thousands or millions, given the large numbers, and various performance indicators (though without labels, this is speculative). Specific financial metrics are not labeled but are present for each CRR, potentially indicating exposures or provisions related to each CRR.\n\nThe columns to the right of each segment include numerical adjustments (indicated by parentheses for negative values) and credit ratings such as \"AA- and above\" to \"D\" alongside percentages, potentially indicating loss estimates or risk weights tied to these credit ratings.\n\nOverall, the table is likely used to assess credit risk exposure across different types of financial counterparties (corporate, non-bank, and bank) by credit rating, aiding in financial risk management and reporting processes."}

The portfolio is  globally diversified with larger concentrations in Hong Kong,  the UK and the US. \nOur global exposure is centred largely on cities with economic,  political or cultural significance. In more developed markets, our  exposure mainly comprises the financing of investment assets, the  redevelopment of existing stock and the augmentation of both  commercial and residential markets to support economic and  population growth. In less-developed commercial real estate  markets, our exposures comprise lending for development assets  on relatively short tenors with a particular focus on supporting  larger, better capitalised developers involved in residential  construction or assets supporting economic expansion. \n\nCommercial real estate lending declined \\$5bn, including  favourable foreign exchange movements of   $\\S2.4\\mathsf{b n}$  , mainly in  Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, within the UK. \nThe table displays data on gross loans and advances across different geographical regions, including Europe, Asia, MENA (Middle East and North Africa), North America, and Latin America, summarized as Total. It provides specific data for the UK and Hong Kong within the Total.\n\nThe breakdown in the table is as follows:\n\n1. **Stage 1 Loans and Advances**: Performing loans expected to make all repayments.\n   - Largest region is Asia with $63,276 million, smallest is Latin America with $1,269 million.\n\n2. **Stage 2 Loans and Advances**: Loans with a significant increase in credit risk.\n   - Largest region is Asia with $11,686 million, smallest is MENA with $436 million.\n\n3. **Stage 3 Loans and Advances**: Non-performing loans.\n   - Largest region is Europe with $1,114 million, smallest is Asia with $37 million.\n\n4. **POCI (Purchased or Originated Credit-Impaired) Loans**: Loans that were impaired upon acquisition.\n   - A minimal value of $1 million is noted only in Europe.\n\n5. **Total as of 31 Dec 2020**: The total gross loans and advances per region.\n   - Asia has the largest total of $74,999 million, and MENA has the smallest with $1,833 million.\n\n6. **Renegotiated Loans**: Loans with modified terms.\n   - Europe has a significant portion ($751 million) compared to other regions.\n\n7. **Allowance for ECL (Expected Credit Losses)**: Provisions for potential loan losses against each region.\n   - Europe has the largest allowance with $(650) million.\n\nOverall, the table provides detailed insights into the distribution and risk classification of loans across global regions, highlighting specific figures for the UK and Hong Kong within the Total.\nThe table presents financial data related to loans, specifically categorizing loans into various stages and classifications as of December 31, 2019. The details in the table can be interpreted as follows:\n\n1. **Stages of Loans**:\n   - **Stage 1**: Represents loans with minimal credit risk, showing values across several categories.\n   - **Stage 2**: Represents loans with increased credit risk.\n   - **Stage 3**: Represents credit-impaired loans.\n   - **POCI**: Pertains to purchased or originated credit-impaired loans.\n\n2. **Values**:\n   - For each stage and POCI, values are given across multiple unspecified categories, probably representing different types of financial loans or accounts.\n\n3. **Total Values at December 31, 2019**:\n   - Aggregate totals are provided, summing up values across all the stages and categories.\n\n4. **Renegotiated Loans**:\n   - Identifies the subset of loans that have been renegotiated under each stage.\n\n5. **Allowance for ECL (Expected Credit Loss)**:\n   - Displays allowances made for expected credit losses for each stage and overall.\n\nThe table quantifies loan portfolios in terms of their classification by credit risk stages and marks allowances made for potential credit losses. These figures are essential for financial institutions in assessing their current exposure and credit risk management.\nRefinance risk in commercial real estate \nCommercial real estate lending tends to require the repayment of  a significant proportion of the principal at maturity. Typically, a  customer will arrange repayment through the acquisition of a new  loan to settle the existing debt. Refinance risk is the risk that a  \ncustomer, being unable to repay the debt on maturity, fails to  refinance it at commercial rates. We monitor our commercial real  estate portfolio closely, assessing indicators for signs of potential  issues with refinancing. \nThe table presents data on financial obligations that can be classified as \"On demand, overdrafts, or revolving\" across different regions, comparing figures from December 31, 2020, to those from December 31, 2019. The regions covered include Europe, Asia, MENA (Middle East and North Africa), North America, and Latin America, with a total column and further breakdowns for the UK and Hong Kong.\n\nFor December 31, 2020:\n1. \"< 1 year\" commitments totaled $45,609 million across all regions, with the largest share from Asia ($25,075 million).\n2. \"1–2 years\" commitments totaled $28,434 million, again led by Asia ($18,396 million).\n3. \"2–5 years\" commitments amounted to $37,823 million, with Asia contributing $27,699 million.\n4. \"> 5 years\" commitments were $7,667 million in total, with Asia showing the highest amount ($3,829 million).\n5. The total \"On demand, overdrafts, or revolving\" amount was $119,533 million.\n\nFor December 31, 2019:\n1. \"< 1 year\" commitments were $42,289 million, with Asia again contributing the highest amount ($21,625 million).\n2. \"1–2 years\" obligations totaled $25,632 million, led by Asia ($17,638 million).\n3. \"2–5 years\" commitments were $48,706 million, with Asia's share as the largest ($35,557 million).\n4. \"> 5 years\" obligations were $7,953 million in total, with Asia contributing $4,706 million.\n5. The total \"On demand, overdrafts, or revolving\" value was $124,580 million.\n\nThe table helps to provide insights into financial exposure by region and maturity period and highlights the concentration of obligations in specific regions and timeframes.\nCollateral and other credit enhancements \n(Audited) \nAlthough collateral can be an important mitigant of credit risk, it is  the Group’s practice to lend on the basis of the customer’s ability  to meet their obligations out of cash flow resources rather than  placing primary reliance on collateral and other credit risk  enhancements.

We aim to\nmaintain a strong capital and liquidity base to support the risks\ninherent in our business and invest in accordance with our\nstrategy, meeting both consolidated and local regulatory\nrequirements at all times.\n\nOur policy is underpinned by our risk management framework, our\n\ninternal capital adequacy assessment process (‘ICAAP’) and our\ninternal liquidity adequacy assessment process (‘ILAAP’). The risk\nframework incorporates a number of measures aligned to our\nassessment of risks for both internal and regulatory purposes.\n\nThese risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, structural\nforeign exchange, banking book foreign exchange risk and interest\n\nrate risk in the banking book.\n\nThe ICAAP and ILAAP provide an assessment of the Group's\ncapital and liquidity adequacy with consideration of HSBC's risk\nmetrics, business model, strategy, performance and planning,\nrisks to capital, and the implications of stress testing to capital.\n\nFor further details, refer to our Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2020.\nTreasury risk management\nKey developments in 2020\n\nIn 2020, we established the Treasury Risk Management function.\nThis function is a dedicated second line of defence, providing\nindependent oversight of treasury activities across capital risk,\nliquidity and funding risk, structural foreign exchange risk, banking\nbook foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk in the banking\nbook, together with pension risk. The approach to treasury risk\nmanagement is evolving. This will operate across the Group\nfocusing on both adequacy of capital and sufficiency of returns. In\n2020, we carried out several initiatives focused on treasury risk:\n\ne We focused on the management of capital and liquidity to\nensure we responded to the unprecedented customer and\ncapital demands arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\ne¢ In response to a written request from the PRA, we cancelled\nthe fourth interim dividend for 2019 of $0.21 per ordinary share.\nSimilar requests were also made to other UK incorporated\nbanking groups. We also announced that we would make no\nquarterly or interim dividend payments or accruals in respect of\nordinary shares until the end of 2020. In December 2020, the\nPRA announced a temporary approach to shareholder\ndistributions for 2020. After considering the requirements of the\ntemporary approach, the Board announced an interim dividend\nfor 2020 of $0.15 per ordinary share.\n\ne In our response to the Covid-19 outbreak, we liaised with\ngovernments, central banks and regulatory authorities globally,\nto ensure there was continued support and provision of\nfinancial services to the real economy. The Bank of England’s\nFinancial Policy Committee announced a reduction of the UK\ncountercyclical buffer rate to 0% effective from March 2020.\nThis change was reflected in the Group’s risk appetite\nstatement, and together with other regulatory relief, resulted in\na reduction to Group common equity tier 1 (‘CET1’) and\nleverage ratio requirements.\n\n¢ We implemented the acceleration of some of the beneficial\nelements of the amendments to the Capital Requirements\nRegulation (‘CRR II’) that were originally scheduled for June\n2021. The relevant changes impacting the fourth quarter of\n2020 positions included a resetting of the transitional\nprovisions in relation to recognising IFRS 9 provisions and the\napplication of the revised small and medium-sized enterprises\n(‘SME’) supporting factor. It also included changes in the\ncapital treatment of software intangible assets and the netting\nof the leverage ratio exposure measure of regular-way\npurchases and sales. Additionally, there were changes that\nenabled more favourable prudential treatment for investments\nin infrastructure, beneficial changes to prudent valuation\nadjustments and exemptions of market risk back-testing\nexceptions that arose due to the extraordinary market\ndislocations.\n\n* The Group’s CET1 ratio was 15.9% at 31 December 2020 and\nthe leverage ratio was 5.5%. The Group also continues to\nmaintain the appropriate resources required for the risks to\nwhich it is exposed, while continuing to support local\neconomies. This has been further informed by additional\ninternal stress tests carried out in response to the Covid-19\noutbreak. Capital risk management practices continued to be\nenhanced across the Group through the Treasury Risk\nManagement function, focusing on both adequacy of capital\nand sufficiency of returns.\n\n¢ The Group’s liquidity levels were impacted by the drawdown of\ncommitted facilities and buy-backs of short-term debt.\nHowever, this was offset by increases in deposits, use of\ncentral bank facilities where appropriate, and the ability to issue\nin the short-term markets as they stabilised.

These risks include credit, market, operational, pensions, structural  foreign exchange, banking book foreign exchange risk and interest  rate risk in the banking book. \nThe ICAAP and ILAAP provide an assessment of the Group’s  capital and liquidity adequacy with consideration of HSBC’s risk  metrics, business model, strategy, performance and planning,  risks to capital, and the implications of stress testing to capital. \nFor further details, refer to our  Pillar 3 Disclosures at 31 December 2020 \nTreasury risk management \nKey developments in 2020 \nIn 2020, we established the Treasury Risk Management function.  This function is a dedicated second line of defence, providing  independent oversight of treasury activities across capital risk,  liquidity and funding risk, structural foreign exchange risk, banking  book foreign exchange risk, and interest rate risk in the banking  book, together with pension risk. The approach to treasury risk  management is evolving. This will operate across the Group  focusing on both adequacy of capital and sufficiency of returns. In  2020, we carried out several initiatives focused on treasury risk:\n\n \n• We focused on the management of capital and liquidity to  ensure we responded to the unprecedented customer and  capital demands arising from the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\n • In response to a written request from the PRA, we cancelled  the fourth interim dividend for 2019 of   $\\S0.21$   per ordinary share.  Similar requests were also made to other UK incorporated  banking groups. We also announced that we would make no  quarterly or interim dividend payments or accruals in respect of  ordinary shares until the end of 2020. In December 2020, the  PRA announced a temporary approach to shareholder  distributions for 2020. After considering the requirements of the  temporary approach, the Board announced an interim dividend  for 2020 of  $\\S0.15$   per ordinary share. \n\n • In our response to the Covid-19 outbreak, we liaised with  governments, central banks and regulatory authorities globally,   to ensure there was continued support and provision of  financial services to the real economy. The Bank of England’s  Financial Policy Committee announced a reduction of the UK  countercyclical buffer rate to  $0\\%$   effective from March 2020.  This change was reflected in the Group’s risk appetite  statement, and together with other regulatory relief, resulted in  a reduction to Group common equity tier 1 (‘CET1’) and  leverage ratio requirements.\n\n • We implemented the acceleration of some of the beneficial  elements of the amendments to the Capital Requirements  Regulation (‘CRR II’) that were originally scheduled for June  2021. The relevant changes impacting the fourth quarter of  2020 positions included a resetting of the transitional  provisions in relation to recognising IFRS 9 provisions and the  application of the revised small and medium-sized enterprises  (‘SME’) supporting factor. It also included changes in the  capital treatment of software intangible assets and the netting  of the leverage ratio exposure measure of regular-way  purchases and sales. Additionally, there were changes that  enabled more favourable prudential treatment for investments  in infrastructure, beneficial changes to prudent valuation  adjustments and exemptions of market risk back-testing  exceptions that arose due to the extraordinary market  dislocations.\n\n • The Group’s CET1 ratio was   $15.9\\%$   at 31 December 2020 and  the leverage ratio was   $5.5\\%$  . The Group also continues to  maintain the appropriate resources required for the risks to  which it is exposed, while continuing to support local  economies. This has been further informed by additional  internal stress tests carried out in response to the Covid-19  outbreak. Capital risk management practices continued to be  enhanced across the Group through the Treasury Risk  Management function, focusing on both adequacy of capital  and sufficiency of returns.\n\n • The Group’s liquidity levels were impacted by the drawdown of  committed facilities and buy-backs of short-term debt.  \nHowever, this was offset by increases in deposits, use of  central bank facilities where appropriate, and the ability to issue  in the short-term markets as they stabilised. As a result of these  liability enhancing actions, the Group and all entities had  significant surplus liquidity, resulting in heightened liquidity  coverage ratios throughout 2020. At 31 December 2020, all of  the Group’s material operating entities were above regulatory  minimum levels of liquidity and funding.\n\n "}

Any interest rate risk that Markets Treasury  cannot economically hedge is not transferred and will remain  within the global business where the risks originate. \nThe ALCM function uses a number of measures to monitor and  control interest rate risk in the banking book, including:\n\n \n• net interest income sensitivity;\n\n • economic value of equity sensitivity; and\n\n • hold-to-collect-and-sell stressed value at risk. \nNet interest income sensitivity \nA principal part of our management of non-traded interest rate risk  is to monitor the sensitivity of expected net interest income (‘NII’)  under varying interest rate scenarios (i.e. simulation modelling),  where all other economic variables are held constant. This  monitoring is undertaken at an entity level by local ALCOs, where  entities forecast both one-year and five-year NII sensitivities across  a range of interest rate scenarios. "}

Exposure\nto these risks arises from short-term cash balances, funding\npositions held, loans to subsidiaries, investments in long-term\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities including debt capital\nissued. The objective of HSBC Holdings’ market risk management\nstrategy is to manage volatility in capital resources, cash flows and\ndistributable reserves that could be caused by movements in\nmarket parameters. Market risk for HSBC Holdings is monitored\nby Holdings ALCO in accordance with its risk appetite statement.\n\nHSBC Holdings uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency\ninterest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk and foreign\ncurrency risk arising from its long-term debt issues.\n\nDuring 2020, HSBC Holdings undertook a variety of liability\nmanagement exercises, including the issuance of fixed-rate\neligible liabilities. Group Treasury generally hedged out the fixed-\nrate interest rate risk on these liabilities in previous years, but as\nmajor interest rate markets remained at very low levels during\n2020, this was assessed on a case-by-case basis and in some\ncases the decision was made to retain the fixed-rate risk.\n\nFor quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see\npages 179 to 180.\n\nPension risk management processes\n\nOur global pensions strategy is to move from defined benefit to\ndefined contribution plans, where local law allows and it is\nconsidered competitive to do so.

Transactional foreign exchange exposure is transferred to Markets  and Securities Services or Markets Treasury and managed within  limits, with the exception of both exposure generating OCI  reserves and limited residual foreign exchange exposure arising  from timing differences or for other reasons. \nHSBC Holdings risk management \nAs a financial services holding company, HSBC Holdings has  limited market risk activities. Its activities predominantly involve  maintaining sufficient capital resources to support the Group’s  diverse activities; allocating these capital resources across the  Group’s businesses; earning dividend and interest income on its  investments in the businesses; payment of operating expenses;  providing dividend payments to its equity shareholders and  interest payments to providers of debt capital; and maintaining a  supply of short-term liquid assets for deployment under  extraordinary circumstances.  \nThe main market risks to which HSBC Holdings is exposed are  banking book interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Exposure  to these risks arises from short-term cash balances, funding  positions held, loans to subsidiaries, investments in long-term  financial assets and financial liabilities including debt capital  issued. The objective of HSBC Holdings’ market risk management  strategy is to manage volatility in capital resources, cash flows and  distributable reserves that could be caused by movements in  market parameters. Market risk for HSBC Holdings is monitored  by Holdings ALCO in accordance with its risk appetite statement. \nHSBC Holdings uses interest rate swaps and cross-currency  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate risk and foreign  currency risk arising from its long-term debt issues. \nDuring 2020, HSBC Holdings undertook a variety of liability  management exercises, including the issuance of fixed-rate  eligible liabilities. Group Treasury generally hedged out the fixed- rate interest rate risk on these liabilities in previous years, but as  major interest rate markets remained at very low levels during  2020, this was assessed on a case-by-case basis and in some  cases the decision was made to retain the fixed-rate risk. \nFor quantitative disclosures on interest rate risk in the banking book, see  pages 179 to 180. \nPension risk management processes \nOur global pensions strategy is to move from defined benefit to  defined contribution plans, where local law allows and it is  considered competitive to do so. In 2020 we reviewed our risk  appetite metrics and in 2021 we will continue to enhance and  expand these to further assist the internal monitoring of our de- risking programmes. \nIn defined contribution pension plans, the contributions that HSBC  is required to make are known, while the ultimate pension benefit  will vary, typically with investment returns achieved by investment  choices made by the employee. While the market risk to HSBC of  defined contribution plans is low, the Group is still exposed to  operational and reputational risk. \nIn defined benefit pension plans, the level of pension benefit is  known. Therefore, the level of contributions required by HSBC will  vary due to a number of risks, including:\n\n \n• investments delivering a return below that required to provide  the projected plan benefits;\n\n • the prevailing economic environment leading to corporate  failures, thus triggering write-downs in asset values (both  equity and debt);\n\n • a change in either interest rates or inflation expectations,  causing an increase in the value of plan liabilities; and\n\n • plan members living longer than expected (known as longevity  risk).

Application  of the new securitisation framework to the pre-existing book  caused RWAs to rise by  $\\S3.4\\mathsf{b n}$  , mainly in Corporate Centre and  GBM. Following the conclusion of discussions with the PRA, we  also transferred several UK corporate portfolios onto a Foundation  IRB approach, causing a  $\\mathbb{S3b n}$   rise in RWAs in CMB and GBM. \nCorporate Centre and WPB RWAs increased by  $\\S5{\\mathfrak{b}}{\\mathfrak{n}}$   as a result of  updates to exposures in Asia and the French retail business.  The  $\\S0.5$  bn fall in market risk largely comprised reductions from  updates to the calculation of stressed VaR and foreign exchange  risk, partly offset by increases due to risks not in VaR. \nAcquisitions and disposals \nThe increase in our shareholding of The Saudi British Bank from   $29.2\\%$   to  $31.0\\%$   led to  $\\S1.0\\mathsf{b n}$   additional Corporate Centre RWAs. \nThe table provides financial data comparing figures from December 31, 2020, to December 31, 2019, in billions of dollars.

The change in  treatment of software assets benefited our leverage ratio by 0.1  percentage points. \nAt 31 December 2020, our UK minimum leverage ratio  requirement of  $3.25\\%$   under the PRA’s UK leverage framework  was supplemented by an additional leverage ratio buffer of  $0.7\\%$  and a countercyclical leverage ratio buffer of  $0.1\\%$  . These  additional buffers translated into capital values of  $\\S17.9\\mathsf{b n}$   and   $\\S\\,1$  .8bn respectively.

The liquidity value  of these liquidity assets for each entity is shown in the following  table along with the individual LCR levels on a European  Commission (‘EC’) basis. This basis may differ from local LCR  measures due to differences in the way non-EU regulators have  implemented the Basel III standards. \nEach entity maintains sufficient stable funding relative to the  required stable funding assessed using the NSFR or other  appropriate metrics. \nGiven our continued focus on the quality of regulatory reporting,  liquidity reporting processes are undergoing a detailed review,  which may lead to impacts on some of our regulatory ratios,  including LCR and NSFR. All entities are above regulatory  minimums and are expected to continue to remain above risk  appetite.  \nThe Group liquidity and funding position at the end of 2020 is  analysed in the following sections. \nOperating entities’ liquidity \nThe table provides financial ratios for various branches and subsidiaries of HSBC as of 31 December 2020. The columns display the following data:\n\n1. **LCR (%)**: The Liquidity Coverage Ratio, which measures the ability of a bank to cover its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. Higher percentages indicate better liquidity.\n\n2. **HQLA ($bn)**: High-Quality Liquid Assets, expressed in billion dollars. This reflects the amount of assets held by the bank that are easily convertible to cash.\n\n3. **Net outflows ($bn)**: The total expected net cash outflows, expressed in billion dollars, representing the liquidity needs of the bank over a certain period.\n\n4. **NSFR (%)**: The Net Stable Funding Ratio, which assesses the stability of a bank's funding profile in relation to its assets over a one-year period. A higher percentage suggests more stable funding.\n\nEach row of the table provides these financial metrics for different entities within the HSBC Group, including HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Bank plc, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (with branches in Hong Kong and Singapore), Hang Seng Bank, HSBC Bank China, HSBC Bank USA, HSBC Continental Europe, HSBC Middle East (UAE branch), HSBC Canada, and HSBC Mexico. \n\nSome entities have footnotes, indicating additional information or specifications not visible in the table snippet provided."}

Traded Risk also restricts trading in the more complex\nderivative products to offices with appropriate levels of product\nexpertise and robust control systems.\n\nKey risk management processes\nMonitoring and limiting market risk exposures\n\nOur objective is to manage and control market risk exposures\nwhile maintaining a market profile consistent with our risk\nappetite.\n\nWe use a range of tools to monitor and limit market risk exposures\nincluding sensitivity analysis, VaR and stress testing.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nSensitivity analysis measures the impact of individual market\nfactor movements on specific instruments or portfolios, including\ninterest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We use\nsensitivity measures to monitor the market risk positions within\neach risk type. Granular sensitivity limits are set for trading desks\nwith consideration of market liquidity, customer demand and\ncapital constraints, among other factors.\n\nValue at risk\n(Audited)\n\nVaR is a technique for estimating potential losses on risk positions\nas a result of movements in market rates and prices over a\nspecified time horizon and to a given level of confidence. The use\nof VaR is integrated into market risk management and calculated\nfor all trading positions regardless of how we capitalise them. In\naddition, we calculate VaR for non-trading portfolios to have a\ncomplete picture of risk. Where we do not calculate VaR explicitly,\nwe use alternative tools as summarised in the ‘Stress testing’\nsection below.\n\nOur models are predominantly based on historical simulation that\nincorporates the following features:\n\n¢ historical market rates and prices, which are calculated with\nreference to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, interest\nrates, equity prices and the associated volatilities;\n\n* potential market movements that are calculated with reference\nto data from the past two years; and\n\n* calculations to a 99% confidence level and using a one-day\nholding period.\n\nThe models also incorporate the effect of option features on the\nunderlying exposures. The nature of the VaR models means that\nan increase in observed market volatility will lead to an increase in\nVaR without any changes in the underlying positions.\n\nVaR model limitations\n\nAlthough a valuable guide to risk, VaR is used with awareness of\nits limitations. For example:\n\ne The use of historical data as a proxy for estimating future\nmarket moves may not encompass all potential market events,\nparticularly those that are extreme in nature.\n\ne The use of a one-day holding period for risk management\npurposes of trading and non-trading books assumes that this\nshort period is sufficient to hedge or liquidate all positions.\n\n¢ The use of a 99% confidence level by definition does not take\ninto account losses that might occur beyond this level of\nconfidence.\n\ne VaR is calculated on the basis of exposures outstanding at the\nclose of business and therefore does not reflect intra-day\nexposures.\n\nRisk not in VaR framework\n\nThe risks not in VaR (‘RNIV’) framework captures and capitalises\nmaterial market risks that are not adequately covered in the VaR\nmodel.\n\nRisk factors are reviewed on a regular basis and are either\nincorporated directly in the VaR models, where possible, or\nquantified through either the VaR-based RNIV approach or a stress\ntest approach within the RNIV framework. While VaR-based RNIVs\nare calculated by using historical scenarios, stress-type RNIVs are\nestimated on the basis of stress scenarios whose severity is\ncalibrated to be in line with the capital adequacy requirements.\nThe outcome of the VaR-based RNIV approach is included in the\noverall VaR calculation but excluded from the VaR measure used\nfor regulatory back-testing. In addition, the stressed VaR measure\nalso includes risk factors considered in the VaR-based RNIV\napproach.\n\nStress-type RNIVs include a deal contingent derivatives capital\ncharge to capture risk for these transactions and a de-peg risk\nmeasure to capture risk to pegged and heavily managed\ncurrencies.\n\nStress testing\n\nStress testing is an important procedure that is integrated into our\nmarket risk management framework to evaluate the potential\nimpact on portfolio values of more extreme, although plausible,\nevents or movements in a set of financial variables. In such\nscenarios, losses can be much greater than those predicted by\nVaR modelling.\n\nStress testing is implemented at legal entity, regional and overall\nGroup levels. A set of scenarios is used consistently across all\nregions within the Group. The risk appetite around potential stress\nlosses for the Group is set and monitored against a referral limit.\n\nMarket risk reverse stress tests are designed to identify\nvulnerabilities in our portfolios by looking for scenarios that lead to\nloss levels considered severe for the relevant portfolio. These\nscenarios may be quite local or idiosyncratic in nature, and\ncomplement the systematic top-down stress testing.\n\nStress testing and reverse stress testing provide senior\nmanagement with insights regarding the ‘tail risk’ beyond VaR, for\nwhich our appetite is limited.\n\nTrading portfolios\n\nTrading portfolios comprise positions held for client servicing and\nmarket-making, with the intention of short-term resale and/or to\nhedge risks resulting from such positions.\n\nBack-testing\n\nWe routinely validate the accuracy of our VaR models by back-\ntesting the VaR metric against both actual and hypothetical profit\nand loss. Hypothetical profit and loss excludes non-modelled items\nsuch as fees, commissions and revenue of intra-day transactions.\n\nThe number of back-testing exceptions is used to gauge how well\nthe models are performing. We consider enhanced internal\nmonitoring of a VaR model if more than five profit exceptions or\nmore than five loss exceptions occur in a 250-day period.\n\nWe back-test our VaR at set levels of our Group entity hierarchy.\nMarket risk in 2020\n\nGlobal financial conditions worsened rapidly with the onset of the\nCovid-19 outbreak from mid-February 2020. Market volatility\nreached extreme levels across most asset classes and equity\nprices fell sharply. In credit markets, spreads and yields reached\nmulti-year highs. The gold market experienced Covid-19-related\ndisruption in refining and transportation, affecting the relative\npricing of gold futures contracts. Oil prices collapsed due to rising\noversupply as demand reduced materially from the economic\nslowdown.

The Fixed Income\nbusiness continued to be the key driver of trading VaR up to the\nend of 2020, although with a lower contribution than in the first\nhalf of the year. Interest rate risks from market-making activities\nwere the main drivers of trading VaR.\n\nTrading VaR at 31 December 2020 was higher than at\n\n31 December 2019. The moderate increase in trading VaR during\nthe year and a spike in the first half of the year were due primarily\nto higher levels of market volatility reached in March and April\n2020, as a result of the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak.\nTrading VaR did not change significantly during the second half of\nthe year and VaR remained in line with the normal range observed\nin 2019.

It represents the reduction in\nunsystematic market risk that occurs when combining a number of different risk types — such as interest rate, equity and foreign exchange —\ntogether in one portfolio. It is measured as the difference between the sum of the VaR by individual risk type and the combined total VaR. A\nnegative number represents the benefit of portfolio diversification.

Amid the challenges posed by the Covid-19 outbreak,\nwe introduced a number of financial crime risk management\n\nmeasures during this period to support the business and our\ncustomers. These included:\n\ne¢ We supported the most vulnerable customers and those in\nfinancial difficulty, including by increasing the awareness of\nfraud during this period.\n\n¢ The Compliance function proactively engaged with other parts\nof the organisation to ensure financial crime risks were\nconsidered as part of Covid-19-related decisions.\n\n¢ Compliance colleagues were seconded to other parts of the\norganisation to assist with supporting the establishment of\ngovernment relief measures.\n\n¢ We supported customers and the organisation through policy\nexceptions, including by allowing email instructions instead of\nface-to-face meetings, and introducing virtual onboarding.\n\nWe consistently review the effectiveness of our financial crime risk\nmanagement framework, which includes consideration of\ngeopolitical and wider economic factors. The sanctions regulatory\nenvironment remained changeable and uncertain during the\ncourse of 2020 due to the ongoing geopolitical tensions between\nthe US and China, the end of the transition period following the\nUK's departure from the EU, and the increasing divergence in\nsanctions policies between the US and the EU on Iran and Russia.\nOur policy is to comply with all applicable sanctions regulations in\nthe jurisdictions in which we operate, and we continue to monitor\nthe geopolitical landscape for ongoing developments. We also\ncontinued to progress several key financial crime risk\nmanagement initiatives, including:\n\ne¢ We continued to strengthen our anti-fraud capabilities,\nfocusing on threats posed by new and existing technologies,\nand have delivered a comprehensive fraud training programme\nacross the Group.\n\ne¢ We continued to invest in the use of artificial intelligence (‘Al’)\nand advanced analytics techniques to manage financial crime\nrisk, and we published our principles for the ethical use of Big\nData and Al.\n\n¢ We continued to work on strengthening our ability to combat\nmoney laundering and terrorist financing. In particular, we\nfocused on the use of technology to enhance our risk\nmanagement processes while minimising the impact to the\ncustomer. We also continued to develop our approach of\nintelligence-led financial crime risk management, in part,\nthrough enhancements to our automated transaction\nmonitoring systems.\n\nGovernance and structure\n\nSince establishing a global framework of financial crime risk\nmanagement committees in 2018, we have continued to\nstrengthen and review the effectiveness of our governance\nframework to manage financial crime risk. Formal governance\ncommittees are held across all countries, territories, regions and\nglobal businesses, and are chaired by the respective chief\nexecutive officers. They help to enable compliance with the letter\nand the spirit of all applicable financial crime laws and regulations,\nas well as our own standards, values and policies relating to\nfinancial crime risks. At a Group level, the Financial Crime Risk\nManagement Meeting, chaired by the Group Chief Compliance\nOfficer, has served as the pinnacle of this governance structure,\nultimately responsible for the management of financial crime risk.\nAs a reflection of the growing maturity and effectiveness of our\nfinancial crime risk management, this meeting was integrated with\nthe Group Risk Management Meeting in January 2021.

Financial risks include market risk, credit risk and\nliquidity risk. Insurance risk is the risk, other than financial risk, of\nloss transferred from the holder of the insurance contract to\nHSBC, the issuer.\n\nHSBC's bancassurance model\n\nWe operate an integrated bancassurance model that provides\ninsurance products principally for customers with whom we have\na banking relationship.\n\nThe insurance contracts we sell relate to the underlying needs of\nour banking customers, which we can identify from our point-of-\nsale contacts and customer knowledge. For the products we\nmanufacture, the majority of sales are of savings, universal life and\ncredit and term life contracts.\n\nWe choose to manufacture these insurance products in HSBC\nsubsidiaries based on an assessment of operational scale and risk\nappetite. Manufacturing insurance allows us to retain the risks and\nrewards associated with writing insurance contracts by keeping\npart of the underwriting profit and investment income within the\nGroup.\n\nWe have life insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in eight\ncountries and territories, which are Hong Kong, France, Singapore,\nthe UK, mainland China, Malta, Mexico and Argentina. We also\nhave a life insurance manufacturing associate in India.\n\nWhere we do not have the risk appetite or operational scale to be\nan effective insurance manufacturer, we engage with a small\nnumber of leading external insurance companies in order to\nprovide insurance products to our customers through our banking\nnetwork and direct channels. These arrangements are generally\nstructured with our exclusive strategic partners and earn the\nGroup a combination of commissions, fees and a share of profits.\nWe distribute insurance products in all of our geographical\nregions.\n\nInsurance products are sold worldwide through branches, direct\nchannels and third-party distributors.\n\nInsurance manufacturing operations risk\nmanagement\n\nKey developments in 2020\n\nThere were no material changes to the insurance risk management\nframework in 2020. Policies and practices for the management of\nrisks associated with the selling of insurance contracts outside of\nbancassurance channels were enhanced in response to this being\nan increasing area of importance for the insurance business. Also,\nenhancements were made to the capital risk framework for\n\ninsurance operations to better align to the Group’s capital risk\nframework.\n\nGovernance and structure\n(Audited)\n\nInsurance risks are managed to a defined risk appetite, which\n\nis aligned to the Group's risk appetite and risk management\nframework, including its three lines of defence model. For details\nof the Group’s governance framework, see page 107. The Global\nInsurance Risk Management Meeting oversees the control\nframework globally and is accountable to the WPB Risk\nManagement Meeting on risk matters relating to the insurance\nbusiness.\n\nThe monitoring of the risks within our insurance operations is\ncarried out by insurance risk teams. Specific risk functions,\nincluding Wholesale Credit and Market Risk, Operational and\nResilience Risk, and Compliance, support Insurance Risk teams in\ntheir respective areas of expertise.\n\nStress and scenario testing\n(Audited)\n\nStress testing forms a key part of the risk management framework\nfor the insurance business. We participate in local and Group-wide\nregulatory stress tests, as well as internally-developed stress and\nscenario tests, including Group internal stress test exercises.\n\nThese have highlighted that a key risk scenario for the insurance\nbusiness is a prolonged low interest-rate environment. In order to\nmitigate the impact of this scenario, the insurance operations have\ntaken a number of actions, including repricing some products to\nreflect lower interest rates, launching less capital intensive\nproducts, investing in more capital efficient assets and developing\n\ninvestment strategies to optimise the expected returns against the Fy\ncost of economic capital. ia\nOQ\ni <\nKey risk management processes s\nMarket risk\n(Audited)\n\nAll our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have market risk\nmandates that specify the investment instruments in which they\nare permitted to invest and the maximum quantum of market risk\nthat they may retain. They manage market risk by using, among\nothers, some or all of the techniques listed below, depending on\nthe nature of the contracts written:\n\ne Weare able to adjust bonus rates to manage the liabilities to\npolicyholders for products with discretionary participating\nfeatures (‘DPF’). The effect is that a significant portion of the\nmarket risk is borne by the policyholder.\n\ne We use asset and liability matching where asset portfolios are\nstructured to support projected liability cash flows. The Group\nmanages its assets using an approach that considers asset\nquality, diversification, cash flow matching, liquidity, volatility\nand target investment return. It is not always possible to match\nasset and liability durations due to uncertainty over the receipt\nof all future premiums, the timing of claims and because the\nforecast payment dates of liabilities may exceed the duration of\nthe longest dated investments available. We use models to\nassess the effect of a range of future scenarios on the values of\nfinancial assets and associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ\nthe outcomes in determining how best to structure asset\nholdings to support liabilities.\n\ne We use derivatives to protect against adverse market\nmovements to better match liability cash flows.\n\n¢ For new products with investment guarantees, we consider the\ncost when determining the level of premiums or the price\nstructure.\n\n¢ We periodically review products identified as higher risk, such\nas those that contain investment guarantees and embedded\noptionality features linked to savings and investment products,\nfor active management.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2020 189\n", "vlm_text": "\nModel Risk Management also reports on model risk to senior  management on a regular basis through the use of the risk map,  risk appetite metrics and top and emerging risks.  \nWe regularly review the effectiveness of these processes,  including the model oversight committee structure, to help ensure  appropriate understanding and ownership of model risk is  embedded in the businesses and functions. \nThis table seems to be a section of a document or a book, most likely a table of contents.

Insurance risk is the risk, other than financial risk, of  loss transferred from the holder of the insurance contract to  HSBC, the issuer. \nHSBC’s bancassurance model \nWe operate an integrated bancassurance model that provides  insurance products principally for customers with whom we have  a banking relationship. \nThe insurance contracts we sell relate to the underlying needs of  our banking customers, which we can identify from our point-of- sale contacts and customer knowledge. For the products we  manufacture, the majority of sales are of savings, universal life and  credit and term life contracts. \nWe choose to manufacture these insurance products in HSBC  subsidiaries based on an assessment of operational scale and risk  appetite. Manufacturing insurance allows us to retain the risks and  rewards associated with writing insurance contracts by keeping  part of the underwriting profit and investment income within the  Group. \nWe have life insurance manufacturing subsidiaries in eight  countries and territories, which are Hong Kong, France, Singapore,  the UK, mainland China, Malta, Mexico and Argentina. We also  have a life insurance manufacturing associate in India. \nWhere we do not have the risk appetite or operational scale to be  an effective insurance manufacturer, we engage with a small  number of leading external insurance companies in order to  provide insurance products to our customers through our banking  network and direct channels. These arrangements are generally  structured with our exclusive strategic partners and earn the  Group a combination of commissions, fees and a share of profits.  We distribute insurance products in all of our geographical  regions. \nInsurance products are sold worldwide through branches, direct  channels and third-party distributors. \nInsurance manufacturing operations risk  management \nKey developments in 2020 \nThere were no material changes to the insurance risk management  framework in 2020. Policies and practices for the management of  risks associated with the selling of insurance contracts outside of  bancassurance channels were enhanced in response to this being  an increasing area of importance for the insurance business. Also,  enhancements were made to the capital risk framework for  \ninsurance operations to better align to the Group’s capital risk  framework. \nGovernance and structure \n(Audited) \nInsurance risks are managed to a defined risk appetite, which  is aligned to the Group’s risk appetite and risk management  framework, including its three lines of defence model. For details  of the Group’s governance framework, see page 107. The Global  Insurance Risk Management Meeting oversees the control  framework globally and is accountable to the WPB Risk  Management Meeting on risk matters relating to the insurance  business. \nThe monitoring of the risks within our insurance operations is  carried out by insurance risk teams. Specific risk functions,  including Wholesale Credit and Market Risk, Operational and  Resilience Risk, and Compliance, support Insurance Risk teams in  their respective areas of expertise. \nStress and scenario testing \n(Audited) \nStress testing forms a key part of the risk management framework  for the insurance business. We participate in local and Group-wide  regulatory stress tests, as well as internally-developed stress and  scenario tests, including Group internal stress test exercises. \nThese have highlighted that a key risk scenario for the insurance  business is a prolonged low interest-rate environment. In order to  mitigate the impact of this scenario, the insurance operations have  taken a number of actions, including repricing some products to  reflect lower interest rates, launching less capital intensive  products, investing in more capital efficient assets and developing  investment strategies to optimise the expected returns against the  cost of economic capital. \nKey risk management processes \nMarket risk \n(Audited)  \nAll our insurance manufacturing subsidiaries have market risk  mandates that specify the investment instruments in which they  are permitted to invest and the maximum quantum of market risk  that they may retain. They manage market risk by using, among  others, some or all of the techniques listed below, depending on  the nature of the contracts written:\n\n \n• We are able to adjust bonus rates to manage the liabilities to  policyholders for products with discretionary participating  features (‘DPF’). The effect is that a significant portion of the  market risk is borne by the policyholder.\n\n • We use asset and liability matching where asset portfolios are  structured to support projected liability cash flows. The Group  manages its assets using an approach that considers asset  quality, diversification, cash flow matching, liquidity, volatility  and target investment return. It is not always possible to match  asset and liability durations due to uncertainty over the receipt  of all future premiums, the timing of claims and because the  forecast payment dates of liabilities may exceed the duration of  the longest dated investments available. We use models to  assess the effect of a range of future scenarios on the values of  financial assets and associated liabilities, and ALCOs employ  the outcomes in determining how best to structure asset  holdings to support liabilities.\n\n • We use derivatives to protect against adverse market  movements to better match liability cash flows.\n\n • For new products with investment guarantees, we consider the  cost when determining the level of premiums or the price  structure.\n\n • We periodically review products identified as higher risk, such  as those that contain investment guarantees and embedded  optionality features linked to savings and investment products,  for active management.

On behalf of the Board,  I wish to thank Laura for her outstanding  dedication and the enormous contribution   she has made to the success of HSBC over  many years. I greatly appreciate the support  and counsel that she has provided to me  personally on many occasions since I   became the Group Chairman.  \nThe Board initiated a search for suitable  candidates to join and strengthen the expertise  on the Board, and further enhance our   Board diversity and knowledge of Asia.   I was delighted that last week we were able   to announce the appointment of Dame Carolyn  Fairbairn as an independent non-executive  Director. Carolyn will bring a wealth of relevant  experience to our Board and her appointment  will be effective from 1 September 2021. I am  pleased to report we are in advanced stages  on other searches that will result in further  strengthening the Board’s skill set.  \nBoard evaluation \nIn line with best practice, the Board and its  committees again conducted a review of the  effectiveness of our operation and practices.  \nOur 2019 review identified a number of areas  for improvement in the way that the Board  operated. We took a number of actions during  the second half of 2019 and throughout   2020 to address the areas identified, which  contributed to improved effectiveness despite  the challenges posed by Covid-19 and the  uncertain geopolitical environment.  \nWe took the decision to once again invite   Dr Tracy Long, the independent board  evaluator, to facilitate our 2020 review, provide  assurance on the progress made, and identify  any areas where further action was required.  Further details of the process, findings and  recommendations from the 2020 review can  be found on page 211.  \nSubsidiary governance \nDuring the year, the Board requested   the Group Company Secretary and Chief  Governance Officer to undertake a review of  subsidiary governance, including a review of  the composition of the principal subsidiary  boards. Following this exercise, principal  subsidiaries will report to the Nomination &  Corporate Governance Committee during  2021 on their future board compositions and  succession plans to help ensure that they have  effective and diverse skill sets that are aligned  with our future strategy. Further details   are set out in the Nomination & Corporate  Governance Committee report on page 213.  \n\nWe enhanced our subsidiary accountability  framework, which applies to all subsidiaries  within the Group, by supplementing this with  clear principles and provisions. The refreshed  framework builds on the progress made to  enhance Group standards with the aim of  achieving world-class governance across   all our subsidiaries. \nWe strengthened connectivity between   the HSBC Holdings Board and principal  subsidiaries by increasing the frequency of the  Chairman’s Forum meetings. These monthly  meetings – which I chair – are attended by the  chairs of the Holdings Board committees and  the chairs of the principal subsidiaries’ boards.  Given the significant uncertainty and  challenges that the Group, the industry and  wider society encountered in 2020, these  more frequent meetings proved hugely  beneficial in identifying and navigating the  challenges facing the Group globally. \nPurpose and values \nAs we developed our purpose and values, the  Board undertook significant engagement with  key stakeholders. Their input was important  and influenced the outcome. It is critical that  the values and associated behaviours are  embedded across the Group. Senior  management’s success in embedding the  purpose and values will be overseen by the  Board. The Board and the Group Executive  Committee set the tone from the top by  adopting these refreshed values, which will  inform the Board’s engagement practices   and help facilitate an open and collaborative  relationship with its stakeholders.

This has been in the form  of formal consideration of our strategy and  ambitions in relation to ESG and climate  issues, as well as training to provide the Board  with insight and an understanding of the  developing landscape and stakeholder  expectations. \n\nRecognising the importance of these matters  to our stakeholders, investors and customers,  the Board was pleased to announce our  updated climate ambition in October 2020.  Further information is provided on pages 24  and 44. \nWorkforce engagement \nMembers of the Board and subsidiary boards  engaged actively with our employees during  2020 in line with the requirements of the 2018  UK Corporate Governance Code in relation to  workforce engagement. \nDespite travel restrictions, all of the non- executive Directors engaged directly with  members of the workforce across our global  business lines, and through our employee  resource groups. This has provided great  insight into the views of the wider workforce  and gave valuable context for the Directors   in informing their discussions at the Board.  Further details of our workforce engagement  practices during 2020 can be found on   page 210. \nLooking ahead \nI am pleased with the progress that the Board  and broader Group have made in enhancing  our governance practices during 2020.  Governance improvements will remain an area  of focus for the Board and its subsidiaries in  the years ahead as the Group aims to achieve  its ambition of operating with world-class  governance. \nAs a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, we   have had to adjust how we engage with our  shareholders and other stakeholders, with  in-person meetings substituted for virtual  meetings where necessary. Despite this, we  continued to engage fully with institutional  investors. With encouraging news regarding  successful vaccines, I look forward to  resuming in-person engagement practices  with our stakeholders when safe to do so. \nThe image shows a handwritten signature.

The  external auditor attended all meetings.  \nThe Chair held regular meetings with management, Global Internal  Audit and the external auditor to discuss agenda planning and  specific issues as they arose during the year outside the formal  Committee process. The Committee also regularly met separately  with the Group Chief Legal Officer, internal and external auditors  and other senior management to discuss matters in private.  \nThe Committee Secretary regularly met with the Chair to ensure  the Committee fulfilled its governance responsibilities and to  consider input from stakeholders when finalising meeting  agendas, tracking progress on actions and Committee priorities.  \nMeetings of the Committee usually take place a couple of days  before the Board meeting to allow the Committee to report its  findings and recommendations in a timely and orderly manner.  This is done through the Chair who comments on matters of  particular relevance and the Board receives copies of the  Committee agenda and minutes of meetings. \nAn internal evaluation concluded that the Committee continued to  operate effectively in 2020, and made certain recommendations  for continual improvement. \nThis image appears to show a signature or handwriting, but specific details about whose signature it is or what it specifically reads cannot be determined.\nDavid Nish "}

Global Internal Audit does this by\nproviding independent and objective assurance on the design and\noperating effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk\nmanagement and control framework and processes, prioritising\nthe greatest areas of risk.\n\nThe independence of Global Internal Audit from day-to-day line\nmanagement responsibility is critical to its ability to deliver\nobjective audit coverage by maintaining an independent and\nobjective stance. Global Internal Audit is free from interference by\nany element in the organisation, including on matters of audit\nselection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or internal audit\nreport content. Global Internal Audit adheres to The Institute of\nInternal Auditors’ mandatory guidance.\n\nThe Group Head of Audit reports to the Chair of the GAC and there\nare frequent meetings held between them. Results of audit work,\ntogether with an assessment of the Group’s overall governance,\nrisk management and control framework and processes are\nreported regularly to the GAC, GRC and local audit and risk\ncommittees, as appropriate. This reporting highlights key themes\nidentified through audit activity, business and regulatory\ndevelopments, and provides an independent view of emerging and\nhorizon risk, together with details of audit coverage.\n\nAudit coverage is achieved using a combination of business and\nfunctional audits of processes and controls, risk management\nframeworks and major change initiatives, as well as regulatory\naudits, investigations and special reviews. In addition to the\nongoing importance of regulatory-focused work, key risk theme\ncategories for 2020 audit coverage were strategy, governance and\nculture, financial crime, conduct and compliance, financial\nresilience and operational resilience. In April 2020, in response to\nthe Covid-19 outbreak, Global Internal Audit completed a risk-\nbased review to revise the 2020 annual audit plan to create\ncapacity for real-time audits targeted at key risks arising from the\npandemic. Real-time audits provide real-time, independent\nongoing observations to management responding to the Covid-19\noutbreak. Issues are raised for significant observations that are not\naddressed in a timely manner.

This is further\ncomplemented with significant overlap in membership of the GAC\nand GRC to ensure deeper understanding and informed challenge\nat both meetings.\n\nDuring 2020, the GAC and GRC Chairs reviewed and challenged\nmanagement's proposals to transition the responsibility for\noversight of entity level controls from the GAC to the GRC. The\nChairs considered whether there was the suitable level of\nmanagement seniority for ownership of entity level controls and\nwhether there was regular and appropriate reporting to both\ncommittees to fulfil their oversight responsibilities.\n\nIn 2020, five ARCC Forums were held with the chairs of principal\nand regional subsidiaries’ audit and risk committees, together with\nsenior management from these subsidiaries.

Global Internal Audit does this by  providing independent and objective assurance on the design and  operating effectiveness of the Group’s governance, risk  management and control framework and processes, prioritising  the greatest areas of risk. \nThe independence of Global Internal Audit from day-to-day line  management responsibility is critical to its ability to deliver  objective audit coverage by maintaining an independent and  objective stance. Global Internal Audit is free from interference by  any element in the organisation, including on matters of audit  selection, scope, procedures, frequency, timing, or internal audit  report content. Global Internal Audit adheres to The Institute of  Internal Auditors' mandatory guidance. \nThe Group Head of Audit reports to the Chair of the GAC and there  are frequent meetings held between them. Results of audit work,  together with an assessment of the Group’s overall governance,  risk management and control framework and processes are  reported regularly to the GAC, GRC and local audit and risk  committees, as appropriate. This reporting highlights key themes  identified through audit activity, business and regulatory  developments, and provides an independent view of emerging and  horizon risk, together with details of audit coverage. \nAudit coverage is achieved using a combination of business and  functional audits of processes and controls, risk management  frameworks and major change initiatives, as well as regulatory  audits, investigations and special reviews. In addition to the  ongoing importance of regulatory-focused work, key risk theme  categories for 2020 audit coverage were strategy, governance and  culture, financial crime, conduct and compliance, financial  resilience and operational resilience. In April 2020, in response to  the Covid-19 outbreak, Global Internal Audit completed a risk- based review to revise the 2020 annual audit plan to create  capacity for real-time audits targeted at key risks arising from the  pandemic. Real-time audits provide real-time, independent  ongoing observations to management responding to the Covid-19  outbreak. Issues are raised for significant observations that are not  addressed in a timely manner. In addition, in response to the  business update in February 2020, Global Internal Audit focused  on governance over the transformation programme and performed  project audit activity for selected complex and high-priority  business cases. \nExecutive management is responsible for ensuring that issues  raised by the Global Internal Audit function are addressed within  an appropriate and agreed timetable. Confirmation to this effect  must be provided to Global Internal Audit, which validates closure  on a risk basis. \nConsistent with previous years, the 2021 audit planning process  includes assessing the inherent risks and strength of the control  environment across the audit entities representing the Group.

These\nconsiderations include stressed scenarios that\nreflect the increasing uncertainty that the global\nCovid-19 outbreak has had on HSBC's operations,\nas well as considering potential impacts from other\ntop and emerging risks, and the related impact on\nprofitability, capital and liquidity.\n\nity and going concern\n\nGoodwill and other non-financial assets\nimpairment\n\nDuring the year, management tested for impairment\ngoodwill and other non-financial assets. Key\njudgements in this area relate to long-term growth\nrates, discount factors and what cash flows to\ninclude for each cash-generating unit tested, both in\nterms of compliance with the accounting standards\nand reasonableness of the forecast. During the\nyear, the Group recognised $1.3bn impairment in\nrelation to non-financial assets, following which a\ndetailed analysis of various balance sheet amounts\nwas initiated.\n\nAssociates (Bank of Communications Co.,\nLimited and The Saudi British Bank)\n\nDuring the year, management performed the\nimpairment review of HSBC's investment in Bank of\nCommunications Co., Ltd (‘BoCom’) and The Saudi\nBritish Bank (‘SABB’). The impairment reviews are\ncomplex and require significant judgements, such\nas projected future cash flows, discount rate, and\nregulatory capital assumptions.\n\nLegal proceedings and regulatory matters\n\nManagement has used judgement in relation to the\nrecognition and measurement of provisions, as well\nas the existence of contingent liabilities for legal\nand regulatory matters, including, for example, an\nFCA investigation into HSBC Bank’s and HSBC UK\nBank's compliance with the UK money laundering\nregulations and financial crime systems and\ncontrols requirements.\n\nSignificant\naccounting\njudgements\n\nValuation of defined benefit pension\nobligations\n\nThe valuation of defined benefit pension obligations\ninvolves highly judgemental inputs and\nassumptions, of which the most sensitive are the\ndiscount rate, pension payments and deferred\npensions, inflation rate and changes in mortality.\n\nValuation of financial instruments\n\nDue to the volatile market conditions in 2020,\nmanagement refined its approach to valuing\nGroup's investment portfolio. In addition, as losses\nwere incurred on the novation of certain derivative\nportfolios, management considered whether fair\nvalue adjustments were required under the fair\nvalue framework. Management's analysis provided\ninsufficient evidence to support the introduction of\nthese adjustments in line with IFRS.\n\nTax-related judgements\n\nHSBC has recognised deferred tax assets to the\nextent that they are recoverable through expected\nfuture taxable profits.

Through these\nreviews, the GRC assessed risks facing the Group to determine the\nprincipal risks to its long-term viability, including those that would\nthreaten its solvency and liquidity.\n\nMonitoring changes to regulatory requirements\n\nDuring 2020, the GRC undertook review and challenge of a\nnumber of risk areas for which the Group has regulatory\nobligations or is facing regulatory change. These included\noperational resilience, climate risk and sanctions. The Committee\nreceived updates on regulators’ rules and guidance relating to\noperational resilience, which is designed to protect customers and\nmaintain economic stability by preventing incidents leading to\nintolerable consumer harm, market disruption, and impact to the\nsafety and soundness of firms.

This change supports the Committee’s  responsibility for review and oversight of the risk management  culture, framework and internal control systems.  \nFinancial risk \nThe GRC provided informed review and constructive challenge to  the Group’s regulatory submissions of ICAAP and ILAAP. It also  monitored progress on the Group’s liquidity risk management  improvement plan, including the development of the internal  liquidity metric. It reviewed work by the Global Finance function  on strengthening recovery planning.  \nThe GRC continued to maintain oversight of the Group’s regulatory  and internal stress testing programmes, particularly in light of the  impact of the Covid-19 outbreak with specific review and  challenge of the key assumptions, strategic management actions  and outcomes of the principal tests conducted. Through these  reviews, the GRC assessed risks facing the Group to determine the  principal risks to its long-term viability, including those that would  threaten its solvency and liquidity. \nMonitoring changes to regulatory requirements \nDuring 2020, the GRC undertook review and challenge of a  number of risk areas for which the Group has regulatory  obligations or is facing regulatory change. These included  operational resilience, climate risk and sanctions. The Committee  received updates on regulators’ rules and guidance relating to  operational resilience, which is designed to protect customers and  maintain economic stability by preventing incidents leading to  intolerable consumer harm, market disruption, and impact to the  safety and soundness of firms. To reinforce continued emphasis  and visibility on financial crime and sanctions compliance, the  GRC organised a full-day training session on international  sanctions early in the year in Hong Kong for our Asia-Pacific non- executive Directors and management. \nThe GRC also considered the PRA’s latest requirements and  expectations relating to evidencing of the embedding of climate  risk management capabilities within regulated firms. \nActivities outside formal meetings \nThe GRC organised a number of activities outside of its regular  meeting cycle to facilitate more effective oversight of the risks  impacting the Group. In particular, the GRC’s formal meetings  continue to be supported by training and ‘walk-through’ sessions  to raise the GRC’s understanding of the underlying domain issues,  ensuring the GRC is well prepared in its informed review and  constructive challenge. The chairs of principal subsidiary risk  committees were also invited. Activities included, among others:\n\n \n• a Directors' education session, held in October 2020, focusing  on the increasingly complex international sanctions and export  control landscape, including key sanctions challenges facing  the Group with the imposition of new US sanctions following  the US Hong Kong Autonomy Act. This education session was  attended by 27 non-executive Directors from across the Group;\n\n • a Directors' education session, held in November 2020, led by  senior leaders in Group Treasury on the implementation of the  internal liquidity metric, which is designed to provide an  internal view of liquidity risk and to ensure the Group holds  enough liquidity to meet and recover from a defined stress; \n\n • GRC Chair’s Working Sessions on a range of topics including  financial crime developments, progress on FCA conduct  remediation matters (May 2020), the Wealth and Personal  Banking conduct programme (May 2020), progress on  regulatory remediation programmes (January and December  2020), the outcomes and implications of the 2020 Group  internal stress test (November 2020), and progress on the 2020  ICAAP and ILAAP submissions (November 2020); and\n\n • three cybersecurity consultation sessions and regular updates  on cyber developments such as cyber-crime, legislation and  \nConnectivity with principal subsidiary risk committees   \nThe risk committees of principal subsidiaries provided half-yearly  confirmations to the GRC. These certifications confirmed that the  principal subsidiary risk committees had challenged management  on the quality of the information provided, reviewed the actions  proposed by management to address any emerging issues or  trends and that the risk management and internal control systems  in place were operating effectively.

We\nprovided more than $26bn in customer relief to our personal\ncustomers during the initial stages of the pandemic and more\nthan $52bn in lending to wholesale customers, many of whom\nstill require our support.\n\ne In line with all other large UK-based banks and at the direct\nrequest of the Group’s lead regulator, the UK’s PRA, we\ncancelled the fourth interim dividend of 2019 and suspended\ndividend payments until the end of 2020. In December 2020,\nthe PRA announced a temporary approach to shareholder\ndistributions for 2020.

We\nuse a countercyclical funding methodology, with both a floor and\na ceiling, to recognise that there will be times when profitability is\nexceptionally low or exceptionally high as a result of factors not\ndirectly linked to employee performance. In such years, factors\nsuch as applying franchise protection and limiting the risk of\ninappropriate behaviour need to be considered when setting the\nvariable pay pool. Nonetheless, financial performance and\naffordability remain central tenets in determining the\nappropriateness of the variable pay pool.\n\nGroup variable pay pool\n\nFor 2020, the Committee reviewed and agreed the Group variable\npay pool of $2,659m, taking into account performance against\nfinancial and non-financial metrics set out in the Group risk\nappetite statement, including conduct, and targets set out in our\noperating plan. This represents a 20.4% reduction in the pool\ncompared with 2019, with the variable pay pool down\napproximately 15% in Global Banking and Markets, asset\nmanagement and private banking, and approximately 22.5% in\nother areas of the Group. We also differentiated by market, with a\nbetter year-on-year outcome in Asia, reflecting the region's\nstrategic importance and consistent contribution towards Group\nperformance.\n\nIn determining the size of the pool, the Committee took into\naccount the fact that overall financial performance was lower than\nwhat we had targeted at the start of the year, and certain non-\nfinancial risk metrics were outside of our risk appetite.

Recognising our people for their performance is a key  element of our reward strategy and helps to drive ongoing  engagement, which is critically important as we navigate through  the Covid-19 outbreak and the Group’s transformation. However,  we must also recognise the impact of these circumstances on our  stakeholders and the wider community. \nActions taken in response to Covid-19 \nIn determining the remuneration outcomes, the Committee noted  the following: \n\n \n• We did not apply for government support packages for our  employees across the countries and territories in which we  operate, and put employee well-being, customer experience,  and supporting the economy at the centre of our response to  the pandemic.\n\n • Our front-line employees continued to serve customers in  challenging circumstances.

Adjusted profit before tax of  $\\S12$  bn was down  $45\\%$   due to lower  revenue and a higher expected credit loss charge directly linked to  the impact of the pandemic. \nHowever, the Group continued to make good progress on its  strategic plan, demonstrated by a   $\\S51$  .5bn reduction of RWAs in  2020 in low-return franchises and a   $3\\%$   reduction in adjusted  costs.

We also continue to  increase investment in technology to drive improved customer  experience and operational efficiency.

As a result, the variable pay accrual\nwas increased in the fourth quarter in response to financial\nperformance and market pay challenges.\n\nReview of workforce remuneration\nRemuneration outcomes\n\nIn allocating the pool, the Committee decided that while the\nvariable pay outcomes for junior colleagues should reflect Group\nperformance, they should receive better outcomes with less\ndifferentiation relative to our senior employees. Overall, total\ncompensation for our junior members of staff was broadly flat,\nwhich we felt was important given their significant efforts in a\nchallenging year. Higher paid employees had an overall decrease\nin total compensation. We also made limited fixed pay increases\nfor 2021 and targeted these towards our junior colleagues.

The Board was conscious of the impact of proceeding with\nredundancies, particularly at the outset of the crisis given the\nsignificant stress for our people and communities, and the need to\nprotect our capacity to serve our customers. The Board lifted the\npause on the redundancy programme in June 2020 while\ncontinuing the freeze on the vast majority of external recruitment\nto make every effort to fill vacancies internally. We maintained a\nregular flow of communication and listened closely to our\ncolleagues’ needs, providing the support and flexibility required to\nhelp them manage their lives during the pandemic, and\nmaintained their full pay without applying for government support\npackages.\n\nWe ran a mid-year employee survey to determine how the\nCovid-19 outbreak was impacting our colleagues and how we\ncould support them through this period.

Following\ncareful consideration, these targets were not revised for the\nsignificant economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak to reflect\nthe Committee’s view that reward for our executive Directors\nshould align with the experience of our shareholders.\n\nNon-financial performance measures were linked to customer\nsatisfaction, employee engagement and diversity, environmental\nstewardship, risk and compliance, and organisational\nsimplification. The Committee noted strong non-financial\nperformance as our commitment to delivering responsibly for our\nstakeholders remained unchanged throughout the pandemic.

While this does not\nimpact outstanding LTI awards, the Committee agreed, in line with\ninvestor expectations, that the 2020 LTI awards should be subject\nto a ‘windfall gain’ adjustment at grant if the share price falls\nsignificantly relative to the grant price of the 2019 LTI. This is to\nensure that the reward for our executive Directors aligns with the\nexperience of our shareholders and is reflective of management\nperformance over the performance period.\n\nWhile the share price to be used for the 2020 LTI award is not\nknown at this stage, the Committee has agreed, in line with\ninvestor expectations, if the 2020 LTI grant share price\nexperiences a greater than 30% decline since the previous grant,\nthis would be considered a material share price fall, and an\nadjustment percentage equal to half the share price percentage\ndecline would be applied to the awards to mitigate the potential\nfor ‘windfall gains’.\n\nExecutive Directors' fixed pay for 2021\n\nWe have increased the base salary of our executive Directors by\n1.6% in line with the average increase for our Group employees.\nAdditionally, in an expansion to his current remit, the Group Chief\nFinancial Officer will assume responsibility for the Group's\ntransformation programme, effective immediately, and its mergers\nand acquisitions agenda, from April. In acknowledgement of the\nexpanded remit and responsibilities, the Committee has decided to\nadjust his fixed pay allowance from £950,000 to £1,085,000 in\naccordance with the terms of the Directors’ remuneration policy\napproved at the 2019 AGM. The executive Directors have made\nthe personal decision to donate 100% of their salary and fixed pay\nallowance increases for 2021 to charity given the ongoing\nchallenging external environment.\n\nInvestor consultation\n\nThe Committee considers that regular dialogue with our\nshareholders, including outside of our policy vote years and\nespecially during these uncertain times, is important to ensure our\nremuneration policy operates as intended and in line with\nshareholder expectations. In 2020, we met with a number of our\nsignificant shareholders and proxy voting agencies to hear their\nviews on executive and wider workforce remuneration. As ever,\nwe found this engagement to be very helpful as we considered the\nimplementation of our remuneration policy, including the ‘windfall\ngain’ adjustment for the 2020 LTI award, and use of ESG\nmeasures in the forward-looking scorecards. Further details of the\n2020 LTI measures and targets are on page 243. The 2021 annual\nincentive scorecard is provided on page 249.\n\nOn behalf of the Committee, | would like to thank investors for\ntheir time during the consultations and their support for the\ndirection of travel.\n\nThe Group’s Directors’ remuneration policy is due to expire at the\n2022 AGM. During the course of 2021, we will be reviewing our\ncurrent approach to Directors’ remuneration and will consult with\nour large shareholders and proxy advisory bodies with the aim of\nintroducing a new policy in 2022. The review will continue to be\nbased on our following key principles:\n\ne The policy should be simple and transparent.\n\n¢ There should be a strong alignment between rewards and the\ninterests of our stakeholders, including shareholders,\ncustomers and employees.\n\n¢ The policy should maintain a focus on long-term performance.\n\n¢ The total compensation package should be competitive to\nensure we can retain and attract talent.\ne The structure should meet the expectations of investors and\nour regulators.\nThe Committee is concerned that over time, HSBC's overall\nremuneration opportunity has fallen behind desired levels to\nreflect the calibre of the executives and market positioning.

While this does not  impact outstanding LTI awards, the Committee agreed, in line with  investor expectations, that the  $2020\\;|{\\mathsf{T}}|$   awards should be subject  to a 'windfall gain' adjustment at grant if the share price falls  significantly relative to the grant price of the 2019 LTI. This is to  ensure that the reward for our executive Directors aligns with the  experience of our shareholders and is reflective of management  performance over the performance period. \nWhile the share price to be used for the   $2020\\;|{\\mathsf{T}}|$   award is not  known at this stage, the Committee has agreed, in line with  investor expectations, if the 2020 LTI grant share price  experiences a greater than  $30\\%$   decline since the previous grant,  this would be considered a material share price fall, and an  adjustment percentage equal to half the share price percentage  decline would be applied to the awards to mitigate the potential  for 'windfall gains'. \nExecutive Directors' fixed pay for 2021 \nWe have increased the base salary of our executive Directors by   $1.6\\%$   in line with the average increase for our Group employees.  Additionally, in an expansion to his current remit, the Group Chief  Financial Officer will assume responsibility for the Group’s  transformation programme, effective immediately, and its mergers  and acquisitions agenda, from April. In acknowledgement of the  expanded remit and responsibilities, the Committee has decided to  adjust his fixed pay allowance from £950,000 to £1,085,000 in  accordance with the terms of the Directors’ remuneration policy  approved at the 2019 AGM. The executive Directors have made  the personal decision to donate   $100\\%$   of their salary and fixed pay  allowance increases for 2021 to charity given the ongoing  challenging external environment. \nInvestor consultation \nThe Committee considers that regular dialogue with our  shareholders, including outside of our policy vote years and  especially during these uncertain times, is important to ensure our  remuneration policy operates as intended and in line with  shareholder expectations. In 2020, we met with a number of our  significant shareholders and proxy voting agencies to hear their  views on executive and wider workforce remuneration. As ever,  we found this engagement to be very helpful as we considered the  implementation of our remuneration policy, including the 'windfall  gain' adjustment for the  $2020\\left|\\mathsf{L T I}\\right|$   award, and use of ESG  measures in the forward-looking scorecards. Further details of the  2020 LTI measures and targets are on page 243. The 2021 annual  incentive scorecard is provided on page 249. \nOn behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank investors for  their time during the consultations and their support for the  direction of travel.  \nThe Group’s Directors’ remuneration policy is due to expire at the  2022 AGM. During the course of 2021, we will be reviewing our  current approach to Directors’ remuneration and will consult with  our large shareholders and proxy advisory bodies with the aim of  introducing a new policy in 2022. The review will continue to be  based on our following key principles:\n\n \n• The policy should be simple and transparent.\n\n • There should be a strong alignment between rewards and the  interests of our stakeholders, including shareholders,  customers and employees.\n\n • The policy should maintain a focus on long-term performance.\n\n • The total compensation package should be competitive to  ensure we can retain and attract talent.\n\n • The structure should meet the expectations of investors and  our regulators. \nThe Committee is concerned that over time, HSBC’s overall  remuneration opportunity has fallen behind desired levels to  reflect the calibre of the executives and market positioning. While  conscious of external sentiment, one of the areas of focus for the  Committee will therefore be ensuring that overall remuneration  levels remain appropriate in the context of the above and support  delivery of our strategic priorities. Any proposed changes would  be discussed with shareholders and the proxy advisory bodies as  part of the wider consultation on the remuneration policy in 2021.  \nOur annual report on remuneration \nAs Chair of the Committee, I hope you will support the 2020  Directors' remuneration report. \n\n$$\nj_{\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow}^{\\Lambda}/{\\downarrow\\downarrow\\downarrow\\Lambda}\n$$\n \nPauline van der Meer Mohr Chair \nGroup Remuneration Committee 23 February 2021 "}

Details of our remuneration practices and our remuneration\npolicy for Directors are published and available to all our employees.\n\nSimplicity\nRemuneration structures should avoid complexity and their\nrationale and operation should be easy to understand.\n\n* Our Directors’ remuneration policy has been designed to achieve simplicity while\ncomplying with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code and the\nremuneration rules of the UK's Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct\nAuthority, as well as meeting the expectations of our shareholders. The objective of each\nremuneration element is explained and the amount paid in respect of each element of pay\nis clearly set out.\n\nRisk\n\nRemuneration structures should identify and mitigate\nagainst reputational and other risks from excessive\nrewards, as well as behavioural risks that can arise from\ntarget-based incentive plans.\n\n¢ Inline with regulatory requirements, our remuneration practices promote sound and\neffective risk management while supporting our business objectives (see page 252).\n\n¢ Risk and conduct considerations are taken into account in setting the variable pay pool,\nfrom which any executive Director variable pay is funded.\n\n¢ Executive Directors’ annual and LTI scorecards include a mix of financial and non-financial\nmeasures. Financial measures in the scorecards are subject to a CET1 underpin to ensure\nCET1 remains within risk tolerance levels while achieving financial targets. In addition, the\noverall scorecard outcome is subject to a risk and compliance underpin.\n\n* The deferred portion of any awards granted to executive Directors is subject to a seven-\nyear deferral period during which our malus policy can be applied. All variable pay awards\nthat have vested are subject to our clawback policy for a period of up to seven years from\nthe award date (extending to 10 years where an investigation is ongoing).\n\nPredictability\n\nThe range of possible values of rewards to individual\nDirectors and any other limits or discretions should be\nidentified and explained at the time of approving the policy.\n\n* The charts set out on page 7 of our Directors’ remuneration policy show how the total\nvalue of remuneration and its composition vary under different performance scenarios for\nexecutive Directors.

As the\nawards are not entitled to dividend equivalents in accordance with\nregulatory requirements, the number of shares to be awarded will\nbe adjusted to reflect the expected dividend yield of the shares\nover the vesting period.\n\nThe 2020 LTI awards will have a three-year performance period\nstarting 1 January 2021. During this period, performance will be\nassessed based on the 2020 LTI scorecard comprising four\nequally-weighted measures: two financial measures to incentivise\nvalue creation for our shareholders; a measure linked to our\nclimate ambitions; and a measure for relative total shareholder\nreturn (‘TSR’).\n\nRoTE was retained as a metric as it remains a key measure of our\nfinancial performance and how we generate returns that deliver\nvalue for our shareholders. Given the uncertainty from the\neconomic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, the Committee\ndetermined it was most appropriate to assess RoTE at the end of\nthe performance period.

Awards are subject to malus  during the vesting period and clawback for a maximum period of 10 years from the date of the award. 2 In line with regulatory requirements, scheme interests awarded during 2020 were not eligible for dividend equivalents. In accordance with the  remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGM, the LTI award was determined at  $z90\\%$   of salary for Ewen Stevenson and the  number of shares to be granted was determined by taking into account a share price discounted based on HSBC’s expected dividend yield of  $5\\%$    per annum for the vesting period (i.e. £4.393).

We also use a countercyclical funding methodology,\nwith both a floor and a ceiling, with the payout ratio generally reducing as performance increases to avoid pro-cyclicality. The floor\nrecognises that even in challenging times, remaining competitive is important. The ceiling recognises that at higher levels of performance\nit is not always necessary to continue to increase the variable pay pool, thereby limiting the risk of inappropriate behaviour to drive\nfinancial performance.\n\nThe main quantitative and qualitative performance and risk metrics used for assessment of performance include:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGroup and business unit financial performance, including capital requirements;\n\ncurrent and future risks, taking into consideration performance against the risk appetite statement (‘RAS’), annual operating plan and\nglobal conduct outcomes;\n\nfines, penalties and provisions for customer redress, which are automatically included in the Committee's definition of profit; and\n\nassessment of individual performance with reference to a balanced scorecard of clear and relevant objectives.

A mandatory global risk objective is included in the scorecard of all other employees.

The following key principles underpin HSBC's identification process:\n\n- MRTs are identified at Group, HSBC Bank (consolidated) and HSBC UK Bank level.\n\n- MRTs are also identified at other solo regulated entity level as required by the regulations.\n\n- When identifying an MRT, HSBC considers an employee’s role within its matrix management structure. The global business and\nfunction that an individual works within takes precedence, followed by the geographical location in which they work.\n\nIn addition to applying the qualitative and quantitative criteria specified in the RTS, we also identify additional MRTs based on our own\n\ninternal criteria, which include compensation thresholds and individuals in certain roles and grades who otherwise would not be\n\nidentified as MRTs under the criteria prescribed in the RTS.\n\nThe list of MRTs, and any exclusions from it, is reviewed by chief risk officers and chief operating officers of the relevant global\n\nbusinesses and functions. The overall results are reviewed by the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe Group Remuneration Committee reviews the methodology, key decisions regarding identification, and the results of the\n\nidentification exercise, including proposed MRT exclusions.\n\n252 HSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2020\n", "vlm_text": "Link between risk, performance and reward \nOur remuneration practices promote sound and effective risk  management while supporting our business objectives.  \nWe set out below the key features of our remuneration  framework, which help enable us to achieve alignment between  risk, performance and reward, subject to compliance with local  laws and regulations: \nAlignment between risk and reward \nThe table outlines a company's remuneration framework, detailing various elements and their applications:\n\n1. **Variable pay pool and individual performance scorecard**:\n   - Tied to company performance.\n   - Incorporates quantitative and qualitative metrics.\n   - Evaluates financial performance, risks, conduct outcomes, and individual objectives.\n\n2. **Remuneration for control function staff**:\n   - Assessed independently of business areas they oversee.\n   - Determined by the Remuneration Committee.\n\n3. **Variable pay adjustments and conduct recognition**:\n   - Adjustments occur due to conduct-related issues.\n   - Positive contributions can also be recognized.\n\n4. **Malus**:\n   - Applies to unvested deferred awards in cases of detrimental conduct or inadequate performance.\n\n5. **Clawback**:\n   - Can be applied to awards over a 7-10 year period.\n   - Triggered by significant losses, regulatory breaches, or failures in risk management.\n\n6. **Sales incentives**:\n   - Generally do not operate commission-based plans.\n\n7. **Identification of MRTs (Material Risk Takers)**:\n   - Based on criteria set in regulations.\n   - Evaluated at both group and local levels.\n   - Reviewed by senior officers and the Group Chief Risk Officer.\n\nThe framework ensures that remuneration aligns with performance and risk management standards."}

In so doing, the  Disclosure Committee is empowered to determine whether a  new event or circumstance should be disclosed, including the  form and timing of such disclosure, and review certain material  disclosures made or to be made by the Group. The membership  of the Disclosure Committee consists of senior management,  including the Group Chief Financial Officer, Group Chief Legal  Officer and Group Company Secretary and Chief Governance  Officer. The Group's brokers, external auditors and its external  legal counsel also attend as required. The integrity of disclosures  is underpinned by structures and processes within the Global  Finance and Global Risk functions that support rigorous analytical  review of financial reporting and the maintenance of proper  accounting records. As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the  Group Chief Executive and the Group Chief Financial Officer have  certified that the Group's disclosure controls and procedures  were effective as at the end of the period covered by this  Annual  Report and Accounts 2020 . \nThe annual review of the effectiveness of the Group's system of  risk management and internal control over financial reporting was  conducted with reference to the COSO 2013 framework. Based on  the assessment performed, the Directors concluded that for the  year ended 31 December 2020, the Group's internal control over  financial reporting was effective. \nPwC has audited the effectiveness of HSBC's internal control over  financial reporting and has given an unqualified opinion. \nGoing concern \nThe Board, having made appropriate enquiries, is satisfied that the  Group as a whole has adequate resources to continue operations  for a period of at least 12 months from the date of this report, and  it therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in  preparing the financial statements. For further details, see page  41. \nEmployees \nAt 31 December 2020, HSBC had a total workforce equivalent to  226,000 full-time employees compared with 235,000 at the end of  2019 and 229,000 at the end of 2018. Our main centres of  employment were the UK with approximately 40,000 employees,  India with 39,000, Hong Kong with 29,000, mainland China with  27,000, Mexico with 15,000, the US with 8,000 and France with  7,000. \nOur people span many cultures, communities and continents. By  focusing on employee well-being, diversity, inclusion and  engagement, as well as building our peoples’ skills and  capabilities for now and for the future, we aim to create an  environment where our people can fulfil their potential. We use  confidential surveys to assess progress and make changes. We  want to have an open culture where our people feel connected,  supported to speak up and where our leaders encourage  feedback. Where we make organisational changes, we support  our people throughout the change and in particular where there  are job losses.

In\nparticular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that\ninvolved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.\n\nCapability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our\nresponsibilities, outlined in the Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material\nmisstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities,\nincluding fraud, is detailed below.\n\nBased on our understanding of the group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations\nrelated to breaches of financial crime laws & regulations and regulatory compliance, including conduct of business, and we considered\nthe extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and\nregulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements, such as the Companies Act 2006 and the UK and\nHong Kong listing rules.

Our audit approach incorporated a number of key aspects:\n\n(1) Audit approach to HSBC's global businesses\n\nWe designed audit approaches for the products and services that substantially make up HSBC's global businesses, such as lending,\ndeposits and derivatives. These global business approaches were designed by partners and team members who are specialists in the\nrelevant businesses. These approaches were provided to the audit partners and teams around the world that contributed to the group\naudit.\n\n(2) Audit work for Significant Subsidiaries:\n\nThrough our risk assessment and scoping we identified certain entities (collectively the Significant Subsidiaries) for which we obtained\naudit opinions. We obtained full scope audit opinions for Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, HSBC Bank plc, HSBC\nUK Bank plc, HSBC North America Holdings Ltd, HSBC Bank Canada and HSBC Mexico S.A. We obtained audit opinions over specific\nbalances for HSBC Global Services (UK) Limited and HSBC Group Management Services Limited and HSBC Bank Middle East Limited -\nUAE Operations. The audits for HSBC Bank plc, HSBC UK Bank plc, HSBC Global Services (UK) Limited and HSBC Group Management\nServices Limited were performed by other PwC teams in the UK. All other audits were performed by other PwC network firms.\n\nWe worked with the Significant Subsidiaries in 2020 to develop an approach for rotating certain smaller locations in and out of scope\nover a number of reporting periods. These locations, which are subject to local external audits, are individually relatively small compared\nto the group. Notwithstanding their size, the rotational approach is designed to ensure that over time these locations are subject to audit\nwork as part of the group audit. India was removed from the scope of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation audit for 2020\nand Singapore was included.\n\nWe asked the partners and teams reporting to us on the Significant Subsidiaries to work to assigned materiality levels reflecting the size\nof the operations they audited. The performance materiality levels ranged from $45m to $641m. Certain Significant Subsidiaries were\naudited to a local statutory audit materiality that was less than our overall group materiality.\n\nWe were in active dialogue throughout the year with the partners and teams responsible for the audits of the Significant Subsidiaries.\nThis included consideration of how they planned and performed their work, including their use of the global business approaches. We\nattended Audit Committee meetings for some of Significant Subsidiaries. We also attended meetings with management in each of these\nSignificant Subsidiaries at the year-end.\n\nThe audit of The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in Hong Kong relied upon work performed by other teams in Hong Kong\nand the PwC network firms in Malaysia, mainland China and Singapore. Similarly, the audit of HSBC Bank plc and HSBC UK Bank plc in\nthe UK relied upon work performed by other teams in the UK and the PwC network firms in France and Germany. We considered how\nthe audit partners and teams for the Significant Subsidiaries instructed and provided oversight to the work performed in these locations.\nCollectively, PwC network firms completed audit procedures covering 88% of assets and 73% of total operating income.\n\n(3) Audit work performed at Operations Centres\n\nA significant amount of the operational processes and controls which are critical to financial reporting are undertaken in operations\ncentres run by Digital Business Services (‘DBS’) across 12 different locations. Financial reporting processes are performed in HSBC's\nfour Finance Operations Centres. We coordinated and provided oversight on the audit work performed by PwC teams in the UK, Poland,\nChina, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, India and the Philippines. This work was relied upon by us, as well as the PwC teams auditing the Significant\nSubsidiaries.\n\n(4) Audit procedures undertaken at a group level and on the company\n\nWe ensured that appropriate further work was undertaken for the HSBC group and company. This work included auditing, for example,\nthe impairment assessment of goodwill and intangible assets, the consolidation of the group’s results, the preparation of the financial\nstatements, certain disclosures within the Directors’ remuneration report, litigation provisions and exposures, taxation, and\nmanagement's entity level and oversight controls relevant to financial reporting. Subsidiaries’ balances that were not identified as part of\na Significant Subsidiary were subject to procedures which mitigated the risk of material misstatement, including testing of entity level\ncontrols, information technology general controls, testing at the Operations Centre, analytical review procedures and understanding and\nassessing the outcome of local external audits.\n\n(5) Using the work of others\n\nWe continued to make use of evidence provided by others. This included testing of controls performed by Global Internal Audit and\nmanagement themselves in some low risk areas. We used the work of PwC experts, for example, valuation experts for our work around\nthe assumptions used in the impairment assessment over goodwill and actuaries on the estimates used in determining pension\nliabilities. An increasing number of controls are operated on behalf of HSBC by third parties. We rely on audit evidence that is scoped\nand provided by other auditors that are engaged by those third parties. For example, we obtain a report evidencing the testing of\nexternal systems and controls supporting HSBC's payroll and HR processes.\n\nConclusions relating to going concern\n\nOur evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group's and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of\naccounting included:\n\ns]u9W9}e}s |eIOUeULY\n\ne Performing a risk assessment to identify factors that could impact the going concern basis of accounting, including the impact of\nCovid-19 and geopolitical risks.\n\ne Understanding and evaluating the group’s financial forecasts and the group’s stress testing of liquidity and regulatory capital,\nincluding the severity of the stress scenarios that were used.\n\ne Reading and evaluating the adequacy of the disclosures made in the financial statements in relation to going concern.\n\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that,\nindividually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group's and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for a\nperiod of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the\npreparation of the financial statements is appropriate.\n\nHSBC Holdings plc Annual Report and Accounts 2020 275\n", "vlm_text": "How we tailored the audit scope \nWe tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as  a whole, reflecting the structure of the group and the company, the processes and controls relevant to financial reporting, and the  industry in which they operate.

However, the IASB has\npublished a number of minor amendments to IFRSs that are effective from 1 January 2022 and 1 January 2023. HSBC expects they will\nhave an insignificant effect, when adopted, on the consolidated financial statements of HSBC and the separate financial statements of\nHSBC Holdings.\n\nNew IFRSs\nIFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’\n\nIFRS 17 ‘Insurance Contracts’ was issued in May 2017, with amendments to the standard issued in June 2020. The standard sets out the\nrequirements that an entity should apply in accounting for insurance contracts it issues and reinsurance contracts it holds. Following the\namendments, IFRS 17 is effective from 1 January 2023. The Group is in the process of implementing IFRS 17. Industry practice and\ninterpretation of the standard are still developing. Therefore, the likely numerical impact of its implementation remains uncertain.\nHowever, we have the following expectations as to the impact compared with the Group’s current accounting policy for insurance\ncontracts, which is set out in policy 1.2(j) below:\n\ne Under IFRS 17, there will be no PVIF asset recognised; rather the estimated future profit will be included in the measurement of the\ninsurance contract liability as the contractual service margin (‘CSM’) and gradually recognised in revenue as services are provided\nover the duration of the insurance contract. The PVIF asset will be eliminated to equity on transition, together with other adjustments\nto assets and liabilities to reflect IFRS 17 measurement requirements and any consequential amendments to financial assets in the\nscope of IFRS 9;\n\ne IFRS 17 requires increased use of current market values in the measurement of insurance liabilities. Depending on the measurement\nmodel, changes in market conditions for certain products (measured under the General Measurement Approach) are immediately\nrecognised in profit or loss, while for other products (measured under the Variable Fee Approach) they will be included in the\nmeasurement of CSM.\n\ne In accordance with IFRS 17, directly attributable costs will be included in the results of insurance services as profit is recognised over\nthe duration of insurance contracts. Costs that are not directly attributable will remain in operating expenses. This will result in a\nreduction in operating expenses compared with the current accounting policy.\n\n(d) Foreign currencies\n\nHSBC's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars because the US dollar and currencies linked to it form the major\ncurrency bloc in which HSBC transacts and funds its business.

The amount of goodwill included in a disposal group is measured on the basis of the relative values of the operation  disposed of and the portion of the CGU retained. \nCritical accounting estimates and judgements \nThe review of goodwill and non-financial assets (see Note 1.2(n)) for impairment reflects management’s best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs  and the rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as follows: \nThe table discusses two main topics related to financial reporting:\n\n**Judgements:**\n- The accuracy of forecast cash flows is highly uncertain in volatile market conditions. \n- Management may test goodwill for impairment more frequently when necessary.\n- The purpose is to ensure assumptions remain relevant to current market conditions and management's estimates.\n\n**Estimates:**\n- Future cash flows of CGUs are sensitive and based on detailed forecasts and assumptions of sustainable cash flows.\n- Discount rates for cash flows affect valuation and are influenced by economic variables, such as risk-free interest rates and business risk premiums.\n- Key assumptions for estimating goodwill and non-financial asset impairment are in Note 21.\nHSBC sponsored structured entities \nHSBC is considered to sponsor another entity if, in addition to ongoing involvement with the entity, it had a key role in establishing that  entity or in bringing together relevant counterparties so the transaction that is the purpose of the entity could occur. HSBC is generally  not considered a sponsor if the only involvement with the entity is merely administrative. \nInterests in associates and joint arrangements \nJoint arrangements are investments in which HSBC, together with one or more parties, has joint control. Depending on HSBC’s rights  and obligations, the joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture. HSBC classifies investments in entities  over which it has significant influence, and that are neither subsidiaries nor joint arrangements, as associates. \nHSBC recognises its share of the assets, liabilities and results in a joint operation. Investments in associates and interests in joint  ventures are recognised using the equity method. The attributable share of the results and reserves of joint ventures and associates is  included in the consolidated financial statements of HSBC based on either financial statements made up to 31 December or pro-rated  amounts adjusted for any material transactions or events occurring between the date the financial statements are available and 31  December. \nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are assessed at each reporting date and tested for impairment when there is an indication  that the investment may be impaired. Goodwill on acquisitions of interests in joint ventures and associates is not tested separately for  impairment, but is assessed as part of the carrying amount of the investment. "}

Customer liabilities under linked and certain\nnon-linked investment contracts issued by insurance subsidiaries are determined based on the fair value of the assets held in the\nlinked funds. If no fair value designation was made for the related assets, at least some of the assets would otherwise be measured at\neither fair value through other comprehensive income or amortised cost. The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and\nreported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows changes in\nfair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line.\n\n¢ Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance\nevaluated on a fair value basis.\n\n(h) Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other\nindices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified\nas assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial\nliabilities, which are bifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis.\n\nWhere the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the contractual interest is\nshown in ‘Interest expense’ together with the interest payable on the issued debt.\n\nHedge accounting\n\nWhen derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge\naccounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC uses these derivatives or,\nwhere allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations as appropriate to the risk being hedged.\n\nFair value hedge\n\nFair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but\nresults in recognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise\nbe recognised in the income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued and the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement on a\nrecalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income\nstatement immediately.\n\nCash flow hedge\n\nThe effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective\nportion of the change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised\nimmediately in the income statement within ‘Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis’.\nThe accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same\nperiods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any\ncumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the\nincome statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in\nother comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement.\n\nNet investment hedge\n\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of gains\nand losses on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and other gains and losses are recognised\nimmediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the\nincome statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation.\n\nDerivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting\n\nNon-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not\napplied.\n\n(i) Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets\n\nExpected credit losses (‘ECL’) are recognised for loans and advances to banks and customers, non-trading reverse repurchase\nagreements, other financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments and\nfinancial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial\nguarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining\nlife is less than 12 months ('12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is required for\nECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where\n12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be ‘stage 1’; financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant\nincrease in credit risk are in ‘stage 2’; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment so are considered to be in\ndefault or otherwise credit impaired are in ‘stage 3’.

The related financial assets and liabilities are managed and  reported to management on a fair value basis. Designation at fair value of the financial assets and related liabilities allows changes in  fair values to be recorded in the income statement and presented in the same line.\n\n • Financial liabilities that contain both deposit and derivative components: These financial liabilities are managed and their performance  evaluated on a fair value basis. \n(h)  Derivatives \nDerivatives are financial instruments that derive their value from the price of underlying items such as equities, interest rates or other  indices. Derivatives are recognised initially and are subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss. Derivatives are classified  as assets when their fair value is positive or as liabilities when their fair value is negative. This includes embedded derivatives in financial  liabilities, which are bifurcated from the host contract when they meet the definition of a derivative on a stand-alone basis. \nWhere the derivatives are managed with debt securities issued by HSBC that are designated at fair value, the contractual interest is  shown in ‘Interest expense’ together with the interest payable on the issued debt. \nHedge accounting \nWhen derivatives are not part of fair value designated relationships, if held for risk management purposes they are designated in hedge  accounting relationships where the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness are met. HSBC uses these derivatives or,  where allowed, other non-derivative hedging instruments in fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign  operations as appropriate to the risk being hedged. \nFair value hedge \nFair value hedge accounting does not change the recording of gains and losses on derivatives and other hedging instruments, but  results in recognising changes in the fair value of the hedged assets or liabilities attributable to the hedged risk that would not otherwise  be recognised in the income statement. If a hedge relationship no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is  discontinued and the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement on a  recalculated effective interest rate, unless the hedged item has been derecognised, in which case it is recognised in the income  statement immediately. \nCash flow hedge \nThe effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective  portion of the change in fair value of derivative hedging instruments that are part of a cash flow hedge relationship is recognised  immediately in the income statement within ‘Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis’.  The accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the income statement in the same  periods in which the hedged item affects profit or loss. When a hedge relationship is discontinued, or partially discontinued, any  cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income remains in equity until the forecast transaction is recognised in the  income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in  other comprehensive income is immediately reclassified to the income statement. \nNet investment hedge \nHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for in a similar way to cash flow hedges. The effective portion of gains  and losses on the hedging instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and other gains and losses are recognised  immediately in the income statement. Gains and losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to the  income statement on the disposal, or part disposal, of the foreign operation. \nDerivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting \nNon-qualifying hedges are derivatives entered into as economic hedges of assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting was not  applied. \n(i)  Impairment of amortised cost and FVOCI financial assets \nExpected credit losses (‘ECL’) are recognised for loans and advances to banks and customers, non-trading reverse repurchase  agreements, other financial assets held at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at FVOCI, and certain loan commitments and  financial guarantee contracts. At initial recognition, allowance (or provision in the case of some loan commitments and financial  guarantees) is required for ECL resulting from default events that are possible within the next 12 months, or less, where the remaining  life is less than 12 months (’12-month ECL’). In the event of a significant increase in credit risk, allowance (or provision) is required for  ECL resulting from all possible default events over the expected life of the financial instrument (‘lifetime ECL’). Financial assets where  12-month ECL is recognised are considered to be ‘stage  $\\uparrow^{\\prime};$   financial assets that are considered to have experienced a significant  increase in credit risk are in ‘stage   $_2\\prime$  ; and financial assets for which there is objective evidence of impairment so are considered to be in  default or otherwise credit impaired are in ‘stage  $_{3^{\\prime}}$  . Purchased or originated credit-impaired financial assets (‘POCI’) are treated  differently, as set out below. \nCredit impaired (stage 3) \nHSBC determines that a financial instrument is credit impaired and in stage 3 by considering relevant objective evidence, primarily  whether:  \n• contractual payments of either principal or interest are past due for more than 90 days;  "}

For the wholesale methodology, the lifetime PD also takes into account credit migration, i.e. a customer\nmigrating through the CRR bands over its life.\n\nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) methodology. The expected\nfuture cash flows are based on the credit risk officer’s estimates as at the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and supportable\nassumptions and projections of future recoveries and expected future receipts of interest. Collateral is taken into account if it is likely\nthat the recovery of the outstanding amount will include realisation of collateral based on the estimated fair value of collateral at the time\nof expected realisation, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral. The cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation\nof the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under four different scenarios are probability-weighted by\nreference to the economic scenarios applied more generally by the Group and the judgement of the credit risk officer in relation to the\nlikelihood of the workout strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases, the effect of different economic\nscenarios and work-out strategies is approximated and applied as an adjustment to the most likely outcome.\n\nPeriod over which ECL is measured\n\nExpected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring\nECL (be it 12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which HSBC is exposed to credit risk. For wholesale\noverdrafts, credit risk management actions are taken no less frequently than on an annual basis and therefore this period is to the\nexpected date of the next substantive credit review. The date of the substantive credit review also represents the initial recognition of the\nnew facility. However, where the financial instrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to\ndemand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not serve to limit HSBC’s exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice\nperiod, the contractual period does not determine the maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period HSBC.\nremains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit risk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards,\nwhere the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to default or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio\nbasis and ranging from between two and six years. In addition, for these facilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan\ncommitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for\nthe financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as\na provision.\n\nForward-looking economic inputs\n\nHSBC applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions\nrepresentative of our view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected loss in\nmost economic environments.

An insurance contract may also transfer financial risk, but\nis accounted for as an insurance contract if the insurance risk is significant. In addition, HSBC issues investment contracts with\ndiscretionary participation features (‘DPF’), which are also accounted for as insurance contracts as required by IFRS 4 ‘Insurance\nContracts’.\n\n296 HSBC Holdings ple Annual Report and Accounts 2020\n", "vlm_text": "The table compares aspects of \"Regulatory capital\" and \"IFRS 9\" across three categories: Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD), with a brief section labeled \"Other.\"\n\n### PD\n- **Regulatory capital:**\n  - Through the cycle: Long-run average PD over a full economic cycle.\n  - Definition of default includes a backstop of 90+ days past due; adjusted to 180+ days for some UK and US mortgages.\n\n- **IFRS 9:**\n  - Point in time: Based on current conditions and estimates of future conditions impacting PD.\n  - Default backstop of 90+ days past due for all portfolios.\n\n### EAD\n- **Regulatory capital:**\n  - Cannot be lower than the current balance.\n\n- **IFRS 9:**\n  - Amortization captured for term products.\n\n### LGD\n- **Regulatory capital:**\n  - Downturn LGD: Consistent with losses in a severe economic downturn.\n  - Regulatory floors may prevent underestimation due to lack of data.\n  - Discounted using the cost of capital.\n  - All collection costs included.\n\n- **IFRS 9:**\n  - Expected LGD: Estimation of loss, considering future economic conditions.\n  - No floors.\n  - Discounted using the original effective interest rate.\n  - Only includes costs for obtaining/selling collateral.\n\n### Other\n- **Regulatory capital:**\n  - Not specified.\n\n- **IFRS 9:**\n  - Discounted back from the point of default to the balance sheet date.\nWhile 12-month PDs are recalibrated from Basel II models where possible, the lifetime PDs are determined by projecting the 12-month  PD using a term structure. For the wholesale methodology, the lifetime PD also takes into account credit migration, i.e. a customer  migrating through the CRR bands over its life. \nThe ECL for wholesale stage 3 is determined on an individual basis using a discounted cash flow (‘DCF’) methodology. The expected  future cash flows are based on the credit risk officer’s estimates as at the reporting date, reflecting reasonable and supportable  assumptions and projections of future recoveries and expected future receipts of interest. Collateral is taken into account if it is likely  that the recovery of the outstanding amount will include realisation of collateral based on the estimated fair value of collateral at the time  of expected realisation, less costs for obtaining and selling the collateral. The cash flows are discounted at a reasonable approximation  of the original effective interest rate. For significant cases, cash flows under four different scenarios are probability-weighted by  reference to the economic scenarios applied more generally by the Group and the judgement of the credit risk officer in relation to the  likelihood of the workout strategy succeeding or receivership being required. For less significant cases, the effect of different economic  scenarios and work-out strategies is approximated and applied as an adjustment to the most likely outcome. \nPeriod over which ECL is measured \nExpected credit loss is measured from the initial recognition of the financial asset. The maximum period considered when measuring  ECL (be it 12-month or lifetime ECL) is the maximum contractual period over which HSBC is exposed to credit risk. For wholesale  overdrafts, credit risk management actions are taken no less frequently than on an annual basis and therefore this period is to the  expected date of the next substantive credit review. The date of the substantive credit review also represents the initial recognition of the  new facility. However, where the financial instrument includes both a drawn and undrawn commitment and the contractual ability to  demand repayment and cancel the undrawn commitment does not serve to limit HSBC’s exposure to credit risk to the contractual notice  period, the contractual period does not determine the maximum period considered. Instead, ECL is measured over the period HSBC  remains exposed to credit risk that is not mitigated by credit risk management actions. This applies to retail overdrafts and credit cards,  where the period is the average time taken for stage 2 exposures to default or close as performing accounts, determined on a portfolio  basis and ranging from between two and six years. In addition, for these facilities it is not possible to identify the ECL on the loan  commitment component separately from the financial asset component. As a result, the total ECL is recognised in the loss allowance for  the financial asset unless the total ECL exceeds the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, in which case the ECL is recognised as  a provision. \nForward-looking economic inputs \nHSBC applies multiple forward-looking global economic scenarios determined with reference to external forecast distributions  representative of our view of forecast economic conditions. This approach is considered sufficient to calculate unbiased expected loss in  most economic environments. In certain economic environments, additional analysis may be necessary and may result in additional  scenarios or adjustments, to reflect a range of possible economic outcomes sufficient for an unbiased estimate. The detailed  methodology is disclosed in ‘Measurement uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of ECL estimates’ on page 127.  \nThe table is divided into two main columns: \"Judgements\" and \"Estimates.\"\n\n**Judgements:**\n\n1. Defining what is considered to be a significant increase in credit risk\n2. Determining the lifetime and point of initial recognition of overdrafts and credit cards\n3.

Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are tested for impairment at an\nappropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU,\nwhich is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based on appropriate\ninputs (see Note 21).\n\nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to\nthe extent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the\nhigher of their respective individual recoverable amount or nil.

The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets\nwould not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been\nrecognised in prior periods.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\n\nThe review of goodwill and other non-financial assets for impairment reflects management's best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the\nrates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as described in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements in\nNote 1.2(a).\n\n2 ~=Net fee income\n\nNet fee income by global business\n\n2020\nWealth and Global\nPersonal Commercial _ Banking and Corporate\nBanking Banking Markets Centre Total\n$m $m $m $m $m\nFunds under management 1,686 126 477 = 2,289\nCards 1,564 360 25 = 1,949\nBroking income 862 61 616 - 1,539\nCredit facilities 93 740 626 - 1,459\nAccount services 431 598 264 - 1,293\nUnderwriting 5 9 1,002 (1) 1,015\nGlobal custody 189 22 723 = 934\nUnit trusts 881 18 - - 899\nRemittances 71 313 288 (1) 677\nImports/exports = 417 160 = 577\nInsurance agency commission 307 7 1 = 325\nOther 1,123 893 2,369 (2,290) 2,095\nFee income 7,218 3,574 6,551 (2,292) 15,051\nLess: fee expense (1,810) (349) (3,284) 2,266 (3,177)\nNet fee income 5,408 3,225 3,267 (26) 11,874\n2019' 2018\nWealth and Global\nPersonal Commercial Banking and Corporate\nBanking Banking Markets Centre Total Total\n$m $m $m $m $m $m\nFunds under management 1,597 120 460 = 2,177 2,221\nCards 1,602 358 15 = 1,975 1,956\nBroking income 485 40 532 = 1,057 1,210\nCredit facilities 90 785 743 = 1,618 1,723\nAccount services 991 654 365 (7) 2,003 2,177\nUnderwriting 3 6 821 (1) 829 723\nGlobal custody 135 18 564 = n7 736\nUnit trusts 1,011 22 2 = 1,035 1,038\nRemittances 77 362 311 (3) 747 778\nImports/exports 1 497 164 = 662 709\nInsurance agency commission 356 20 1 = 377 404\nOther 1,284 887 2,353 (2,282) 2,242 2,369\nFee income 7,632 3,769 6,331 (2,293) 15,439 16,044\nLess: fee expense (1,998) (380) (3,292) 2,254 (3,416) (3,424)\nNet Fee income 5,634 3,389 3,039 (39) 12,023 12,620\n\n1 Achange in reportable segments was made in 2020.

Other non-financial assets are property, plant and equipment,  intangible assets (excluding goodwill) and right-of-use assets. They are tested for impairment at the individual asset level when there is  indication of impairment at that level, or at the CGU level for assets that do not have a recoverable amount at the individual asset level.  In addition, impairment is also tested at the CGU level when there is indication of impairment at that level. For this purpose, CGUs are  considered to be the principal operating legal entities divided by global business. \nImpairment testing compares the carrying amount of the non-financial asset or CGU with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of  the fair value less costs of disposal or the value in use. The carrying amount of a CGU comprises the carrying value of its assets and  liabilities, including non-financial assets that are directly attributable to it and non-financial assets that can be allocated to it on a  reasonable and consistent basis. Non-financial assets that cannot be allocated to an individual CGU are tested for impairment at an  appropriate grouping of CGUs. The recoverable amount of the CGU is the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal of the CGU,  which is determined by independent and qualified valuers where relevant, and the value in use, which is calculated based on appropriate  inputs (see Note 21). \nWhen the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement to  the extent that the impairment can be allocated on a pro-rata basis to the non-financial assets by reducing their carrying amounts to the  higher of their respective individual recoverable amount or nil. Impairment is not allocated to the financial assets in a CGU. \nImpairment loss recognised in prior periods for non-financial assets is reversed when there has been a change in the estimate used to  determine the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the non-financial assets  would not exceed the amount that would have been determined (net of amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been  recognised in prior periods. \nCritical accounting estimates and judgements \nThe review of goodwill and other non-financial assets for impairment reflects management’s best estimate of the future cash flows of the CGUs and the  rates used to discount these cash flows, both of which are subject to uncertain factors as described in the Critical accounting estimates and judgements in  Note 1.2(a).  \n2 Net fee income \nThe table displays financial data for various categories of income and expense for the year 2020, broken down into three main business segments: \"Wealth and Personal Banking,\" \"Commercial Banking,\" \"Global Banking and Markets,\" and a summary for the \"Corporate Centre\" with a total column. The rows represent various types of income or expense categories, and the values are presented in millions of dollars ($m).\n\nHere's a summary of the data categories:\n\n1. **Income Categories:**\n   - Funds under management\n   - Cards\n   - Broking income\n   - Credit facilities\n   - Account services\n   - Underwriting\n   - Global custody\n   - Unit trusts\n   - Remittances\n   - Imports/exports\n   - Insurance agency commission\n   - Other\n\n2. **Summary Data:**\n   - Fee income \n   - Less: fee expense\n   - Net fee income\n\nEach row lists the dollar amounts attributed to each segment and totals for these categories. The \"Fee income\" is calculated by summing up all the income categories, and \"Net fee income\" is determined by subtracting \"fee expense\" from \"fee income\" for each segment and in total. The totals show combined figures for all segments.\nThe table shows financial data segmented by different banking divisions for the year 2019, with a comparison to 2018. The divisions include Wealth and Personal Banking, Commercial Banking, Global Banking and Markets, and Corporate Centre.

The 2020 data for the change in mortality (decrease) is marked as N/A.\n1 For further details of the principal plan, see page 303. \nThe above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this in  unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit  obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the  projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit asset  recognised in the balance sheet. The methods and types of assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change  compared with the prior period. "}

Management expects the US deferred tax asset to be substantially\nrecovered in seven to eight years, with the majority recovered in the first five years. During 2020, the Group derecognised $250m of\ndeferred tax asset relating to US state tax losses as management did not consider there to be sufficient evidence of future taxable profits\nagainst which to recover these losses before they expire. Management's assessment of the likely availability of future taxable profits\nagainst which to recover the US deferred tax assets takes into consideration the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, past\nbusiness performance and forecasts of future business performance. The most recent financial forecasts approved by management\ncover a five-year period and the forecasts have been extrapolated beyond five years by assuming that performance remains constant\nafter the fifth year.\n\nThe Group's net deferred tax asset of $0.2bn (2019: $1.3bn) also included a net UK deferred tax asset of $0.6bn (2019: liability of\n$0.5bn), of which $0.5bn related to UK banking tax losses created in 2020. The net UK deferred tax asset of $0.6bn excludes the\ndeferred tax liability arising on the UK pension scheme surplus, the reversal of which is not taken into account when estimating future\ntaxable profits. The UK deferred tax asset is supported by forecasts of taxable profit, also taking into consideration the history of\nprofitability in the combined UK banking entities and the fact that the loss arising in 2020 arose due to an identifiable and non-recurring\nreason, being the economic impacts of Covid-19.\n\nUnrecognised deferred tax\n\nThe amount of gross temporary differences, unused tax losses and tax credits for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the\nbalance sheet was $15.6bn (2019: $9.9bn).

Fair values of financial instruments carried at fair value\n\nControl framework\n\nFair values are subject to a control framework designed to ensure that they are either determined or validated by a function independent\nof the risk taker.\n\nWhere fair values are determined by reference to externally quoted prices or observable pricing inputs to models, independent price\ndetermination or validation is used. For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to\ninformation that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument\ncomparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices.\n\nFor fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support\nfunctions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before\nbecoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.\n\nChanges in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories\nincluding portfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments.\n\nThe majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GBM. GBM's fair value governance structure comprises its Finance\nfunction, Valuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing\nvaluation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation\nCommittees, which consist of independent support functions. These committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review\nGroup, which considers all material subjective valuations.\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value\n\nIn certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific\ninstrument. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which\nare either based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an\nactive market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread that is appropriate to\nHSBC's liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group's own credit spread is computed as follows:\nfor each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar\nsecurities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a Libor-based discount curve. The\ndifference in the valuations is attributable to the Group’s own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all\nsecurities.\n\nStructured notes issued and certain other hybrid instruments are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value.\n\nThe credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.\n\nGains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC, recorded in other comprehensive income,\nreverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount.\n\nFair value hierarchy\nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\n¢ Level 1 - valuation technique using quoted market price. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments\nin active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.\n\n¢ Level 2 - valuation technique using observable inputs. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in\nactive markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models\nwhere all significant inputs are observable.\n\n¢ Level 3 - valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs.

For inactive markets, HSBC sources alternative market information, with greater weight given to  information that is considered to be more relevant and reliable. Examples of the factors considered are price observability, instrument  comparability, consistency of data sources, underlying data accuracy and timing of prices. \nFor fair values determined using valuation models, the control framework includes development or validation by independent support  functions of the model logic, inputs, model outputs and adjustments. Valuation models are subject to a process of due diligence before  becoming operational and are calibrated against external market data on an ongoing basis.  \nChanges in fair value are generally subject to a profit and loss analysis process and are disaggregated into high-level categories  including portfolio changes, market movements and other fair value adjustments. \nThe majority of financial instruments measured at fair value are in GBM. GBM’s fair value governance structure comprises its Finance  function, Valuation Committees and a Valuation Committee Review Group. Finance is responsible for establishing procedures governing  valuation and ensuring fair values are in compliance with accounting standards. The fair values are reviewed by the Valuation  Committees, which consist of independent support functions. These committees are overseen by the Valuation Committee Review  Group, which considers all material subjective valuations. \nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value \nIn certain circumstances, HSBC records its own debt in issue at fair value, based on quoted prices in an active market for the specific  instrument. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the own debt in issue is valued using valuation techniques, the inputs for which  are either based on quoted prices in an inactive market for the instrument or are estimated by comparison with quoted prices in an  active market for similar instruments. In both cases, the fair value includes the effect of applying the credit spread that is appropriate to  HSBC’s liabilities. The change in fair value of issued debt securities attributable to the Group’s own credit spread is computed as follows:  for each security at each reporting date, an externally verifiable price is obtained or a price is derived using credit spreads for similar  securities for the same issuer. Then, using discounted cash flow, each security is valued using a Libor-based discount curve. The  difference in the valuations is attributable to the Group’s own credit spread. This methodology is applied consistently across all  securities. \nStructured notes issued and certain other hybrid instruments are included within trading liabilities and are measured at fair value.  The credit spread applied to these instruments is derived from the spreads at which HSBC issues structured notes.  \nGains and losses arising from changes in the credit spread of liabilities issued by HSBC, recorded in other comprehensive income,  reverse over the contractual life of the debt, provided that the debt is not repaid at a premium or a discount. \nFair value hierarchy \nFair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined according to the following hierarchy:\n\n \n• Level 1 – valuation technique using quoted market price. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for identical instruments  in active markets that HSBC can access at the measurement date.\n\n • Level 2 – valuation technique using observable inputs. These are financial instruments with quoted prices for similar instruments in  active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in inactive markets and financial instruments valued using models  where all significant inputs are observable.\n\n • Level 3 – valuation technique with significant unobservable inputs. These are financial instruments valued using valuation techniques  where one or more significant inputs are unobservable. "}

Loans held for securitisation, derivatives with monolines, certain  ‘other derivatives’ and predominantly all Level 3 ABSs are legacy positions. HSBC has the capability to hold these positions. \nPrivate equity including strategic investments \nThe fair value of a private equity investment (including strategic investments) is estimated on the basis of an analysis of the investee’s  financial position and results, risk profile, prospects and other factors; by reference to market valuations for similar entities quoted in an  active market; the price at which similar companies have changed ownership; or from published net asset values (‘NAVs’) received. If  necessary, adjustments are made to the NAV of funds to obtain the best estimate of fair value. \nAsset-backed securities \nWhile quoted market prices are generally used to determine the fair value of the asset-backed securities (‘ABSs’), valuation models are  used to substantiate the reliability of the limited market data available and to identify whether any adjustments to quoted market prices  are required. For certain ABSs, such as residential mortgage-backed securities, the valuation uses an industry standard model with  assumptions relating to prepayment speeds, default rates and loss severity based on collateral type, and performance, as appropriate.  The valuations output is benchmarked for consistency against observable data for securities of a similar nature. \nStructured notes \nThe fair value of Level 3 structured notes is derived from the fair value of the underlying debt security, and the fair value of the  embedded derivative is determined as described in the paragraph below on derivatives. These structured notes comprise principally  equity-linked notes issued by HSBC, which provide the counterparty with a return linked to the performance of equity securities and  other portfolios.  \nExamples of the unobservable parameters include long-dated equity volatilities and correlations between equity prices, and interest and  foreign exchange rates. \nDerivatives \nOTC derivative valuation models calculate the present value of expected future cash flows, based upon ‘no arbitrage’ principles. For  many vanilla derivative products, the modelling approaches used are standard across the industry. For more complex derivative  products, there may be some differences in market practice. Inputs to valuation models are determined from observable market data  wherever possible, including prices available from exchanges, dealers, brokers or providers of consensus pricing.

Similarly, structured notes and derivatives have their values, models, and unobservable inputs outlined.\nPrivate equity including strategic investments \nGiven the bespoke nature of the analysis in respect of each private equity holding, it is not practical to quote a range of key  unobservable inputs. \nPrepayment rates \nPrepayment rates are a measure of the anticipated future speed at which a loan portfolio will be repaid in advance of the due date. They  vary according to the nature of the loan portfolio and expectations of future market conditions, and may be estimated using a variety of  evidence, such as prepayment rates implied from proxy observable security prices, current or historical prepayment rates and  macroeconomic modelling. \nMarket proxy \nMarket proxy pricing may be used for an instrument when specific market pricing is not available but there is evidence from instruments  with common characteristics.

{"page": 322, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_HSBC_2020_322.jpg", "ocr_text": "Correlation\n\nCorrelation is a measure of the inter-relationship between two market prices and is expressed as a number between minus one and one.\nIt is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. There is a wide range of\ninstruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-asset\ncorrelations is used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations.\n\nUnobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices,\nproxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects\nthe wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair.\n\nCredit spread\n\nCredit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash\nflow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset.

It is used to value more complex instruments where the payout is dependent upon more than one market price. There is a wide range of  instruments for which correlation is an input, and consequently a wide range of both same-asset correlations and cross-asset  correlations is used. In general, the range of same-asset correlations will be narrower than the range of cross-asset correlations. \nUnobservable correlations may be estimated based upon a range of evidence, including consensus pricing services, HSBC trade prices,  proxy correlations and examination of historical price relationships. The range of unobservable correlations quoted in the table reflects  the wide variation in correlation inputs by market price pair. \nCredit spread \nCredit spread is the premium over a benchmark interest rate required by the market to accept lower credit quality. In a discounted cash  flow model, the credit spread increases the discount factors applied to future cash flows, thereby reducing the value of an asset.

Sales activities include the structuring and marketing of  derivative products to customers to enable them to take, transfer, modify or reduce current or expected risks. Trading activities include  market-making and risk management. Market-making entails quoting bid and offer prices to other market participants for the purpose of  generating revenue based on spread and volume. Risk management activity is undertaken to manage the risk arising from client  transactions, with the principal purpose of retaining client margin. Other derivatives classified as held for trading include non-qualifying  hedging derivatives. \nSubstantially all of HSBC Holdings’ derivatives entered into with subsidiaries are managed in conjunction with financial liabilities  designated at fair value.

The aggregate cash flows  representing both principal balances and interest cash flows across all portfolios are used to determine the effectiveness and  ineffectiveness. Macro cash flow hedges are considered to be dynamic hedges. \nHSBC also hedges the variability in future cash flows on foreign-denominated financial assets and liabilities arising due to changes in  foreign exchange market rates with cross-currency swaps, which are considered dynamic hedges. \nThe table presents data on hedging instruments by hedged risk for December 31, 2020, and 2019. It is divided into sections for foreign currency and interest rate risks.\n\n### Hedged Risk Categories\n1. **Foreign Currency**\n2. **Interest Rate**\n\n### For Each Category, Details Include:\n- **Notional Amount**: \n  - 2020: \n    - Foreign currency: $24,506m \n    - Interest rate: $35,863m \n    - Total: $60,369m\n  - 2019: \n    - Foreign currency: $21,385m\n    - Interest rate: $54,253m\n    - Total: $75,638m\n\n- **Carrying Amount**:\n  - Assets and liabilities categorized under derivatives.\n  - 2020: Assets: $548m, Liabilities: $450m \n\n- **Change in Fair Value**: \n  - 2020: \n    - Foreign currency: $(630)m \n    - Interest rate: $519m\n\n- **Recognized in Profit and Loss**:\n  - Indicates effectiveness and is linked to net income from financial instruments managed on a fair value basis.\n  - 2020: $5m recognized in profit and loss from interest rate hedging.\n\nNote: Ineffectiveness measures the mismatch in value changes between hedging instruments and hedged items.\nSources of hedge ineffectiveness may arise from basis risk, including but not limited to timing differences between the hedged items  and hedging instruments and hedges using instruments with a non-zero fair value. \nThe table titled \"Reconciliation of equity and analysis of other comprehensive income by risk type\" presents data for the years 2019 and 2020, focusing on cash flow hedging reserves. The table is divided into two main parts, one for each year.\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2020:\n\n- The cash flow hedging reserve at the beginning of the year (January 1, 2020) was $204 million for interest rate risk and -$205 million for foreign currency risk.\n- Fair value gains/losses were $514 million for interest rate and -$630 million for foreign currency.\n- Fair value gains/losses reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement for hedged items that have affected profit or loss were -$107 million for interest rate and $822 million for foreign currency.\n- Income taxes were -$79 million for interest rate and -$23 million for foreign currency.\n- Others were -$37 million for interest rate and -$1 million for foreign currency.\n- The cash flow hedging reserve at December 31, 2020, was $495 million for interest rate and -$37 million for foreign currency.\n\nFor the year ending December 31, 2019:\n\n- The cash flow hedging reserve at the beginning of the year (January 1, 2019) was -$26 million for interest rate risk and -$182 million for foreign currency risk.\n- Fair value gains/losses were $193 million for interest rate and $341 million for foreign currency.\n- Fair value gains/losses reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to the income statement for hedged items that have affected profit or loss were $99 million for interest rate and -$371 million for foreign currency.\n- Income taxes were -$53 million for interest rate and $4 million for foreign currency.\n- Others were -$9 million for interest rate and $3 million for foreign currency.\n- The cash flow hedging reserve at December 31, 2019, was $204 million for interest rate and -$205 million for foreign currency.\n\nThe table is used to track changes in cash flow hedging reserves over the two-year period, analyzing gains and losses from interest rate and foreign currency risks.\nHedges of net investments in foreign operations \nThe Group applies hedge accounting in respect of certain consolidated net investments. Hedging is undertaken for Group structural  exposure to changes in the US dollar-sterling exchange rate using forward foreign exchange contracts or by financing with foreign  currency borrowings. This risk arises due to the Group investment in sterling functional currency subsidiaries and is only hedged for  changes in spot exchange rates. At 31 December 2020, the fair values of outstanding financial instruments designated as hedges of net  investments in foreign operations were assets of nil (2019: nil), liabilities of   $\\mathbb{S}733\\mathsf{m}$   (2019:  $\\mathbb{S485m})$   and notional derivative contract values  of   $\\S10{,}500{\\,}\\mathsf{m}$   (2019:  $\\bar{\\mathbb{S}}10{,}500\\mathsf{m})$  ). These values are included in ‘Derivatives’ presented in the balance sheet. Ineffectiveness recognised in \n\n ‘Net income from financial instruments held for trading or managed on a fair value basis’ in the year ended 31 December 2020 was nil \n\n (2019: nil) and the net investment hedge reserve was a negative  $\\S56{\\mathfrak{m}}$   as of 31 December 2020 (  $\\mathfrak{S}304\\mathfrak{m}$   in 2019 and  $\\mathbb{S780m}$   in 2018).

Significant influence in BoCcom\nwas established with consideration of all relevant factors, including representation on BoCom’s Board of Directors and participation in a\nResource and Experience Sharing (‘RES’) agreement. Under the RES, HSBC staff have been seconded to assist in the maintenance of\nBoCom’s financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method of accounting in\naccordance with IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in\nthe Group’s share of BoCom’s net assets. An impairment test is required if there is any indication of impairment.\n\nImpairment testing\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the fair value of the Group’s investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately nine\nyears. As a result, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which confirmed that there was no impairment at\n31 December 2020 as the recoverable amount as determined by a value-in-use (‘VIU’) calculation was higher than the carrying value.\n\nAt 31 Dec 2020 At 31 Dec 2019\nVIU-— Carrying value Fair value VIU Carrying value Fair value\n$bn $bn $bn $bn $bn $bn\nBoCom 21.8 21.2 7.5 21.5 19.0 10.1\n\nCompared with 31 December 2019, the extent to which the VIU exceeds the carrying value (‘headroom’) decreased by $1.9bn. The\nreduction in headroom was principally due to the impact on the VIU from BoCom's actual performance, which was lower than earlier\nforecasts due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the disruption to global economic activity, downward revisions to\nmanagement's best estimates of BoCom's future earnings in the short to medium term, and the net impact of revisions to certain long-\nterm assumptions. Both the VIU and the carrying value increased due to the impact of foreign exchange movements.\n\nIn future periods, the VIU may increase or decrease depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. The main model inputs are\ndescribed below and are based on factors observed at period-end. The factors that could result in a change in the VIU and an\nimpairment include a short-term underperformance by BoCom, a change in regulatory capital requirements or an increase in uncertainty\nregarding the future performance of BoCom resulting in a downgrade of the forecast of future asset growth or profitability. An increase\nin the discount rate as a result of an increase in the risk premium or risk-free rates could also result in a reduction of VIU and an\nimpairment.

The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management's best estimates of future earnings available\nto ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the best\nestimate. There are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management's best estimate of BoCom’s\nearnings, which is based on explicit forecasts over the short to medium term. This results in forecast earnings growth that is lower than\nrecent historical actual growth and also reflects the uncertainty arising from the current economic outlook.

Significant influence in BoCom  was established with consideration of all relevant factors, including representation on BoCom’s Board of Directors and participation in a  Resource and Experience Sharing (‘RES’) agreement. Under the RES, HSBC staff have been seconded to assist in the maintenance of  BoCom’s financial and operating policies. Investments in associates are recognised using the equity method of accounting in  accordance with IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in  the Group’s share of BoCom’s net assets. An impairment test is required if there is any indication of impairment. \nImpairment testing \nAt 31 December 2020, the fair value of the Group’s investment in BoCom had been below the carrying amount for approximately nine  years. As a result, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which confirmed that there was no impairment at  31 December 2020 as the recoverable amount as determined by a value-in-use (‘VIU’) calculation was higher than the carrying value.  \nThe table displays financial data for \"BoCom\" for the years ending on December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. It includes the following values in billions of dollars:\n\n- **At December 31, 2020:**\n  - VIU (Value in Use): $21.8 billion\n  - Carrying Value: $21.2 billion\n  - Fair Value: $7.5 billion\n\n- **At December 31, 2019:**\n  - VIU (Value in Use): $21.5 billion\n  - Carrying Value: $19.0 billion\n  - Fair Value: $10.1 billion\nCompared with 31 December 2019, the extent to which the VIU exceeds the carrying value (‘headroom’) decreased by  $\\S1.9\\mathsf{b n}$  . The  reduction in headroom was principally due to the impact on the VIU from BoCom's actual performance, which was lower than earlier  forecasts due to the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and the disruption to global economic activity, downward revisions to  management's best estimates of BoCom's future earnings in the short to medium term, and the net impact of revisions to certain long- term assumptions. Both the VIU and the carrying value increased due to the impact of foreign exchange movements. \nIn future periods, the VIU may increase or decrease depending on the effect of changes to model inputs. The main model inputs are  described below and are based on factors observed at period-end. The factors that could result in a change in the VIU and an  impairment include a short-term under performance by BoCom, a change in regulatory capital requirements or an increase in uncertainty  regarding the future performance of BoCom resulting in a downgrade of the forecast of future asset growth or profitability. An increase  in the discount rate as a result of an increase in the risk premium or risk-free rates could also result in a reduction of VIU and an  impairment. At the point where the carrying value exceeds the VIU, impairment would be recognised.  \nIf the Group did not have significant influence in BoCom, the investment would be carried at fair value rather than the current carrying  value. \nBasis of recoverable amount \nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of BoCom, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying  amount. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management’s best estimates of future earnings available  to ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36. Significant management judgement is required in arriving at the best  estimate. There are two main components to the VIU calculation. The first component is management’s best estimate of BoCom’s  earnings, which is based on explicit forecasts over the short to medium term. This results in forecast earnings growth that is lower than  recent historical actual growth and also reflects the uncertainty arising from the current economic outlook. Earnings beyond the short to  medium term are then extrapolated into perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to derive a terminal value, which comprises the  majority of the VIU. The second component is the capital maintenance charge (‘CMC’), which is management’s forecast of the earnings  that need to be withheld in order for BoCom to meet regulatory capital requirements over the forecast period, meaning that CMC is  deducted when arriving at management’s estimate of future earnings available to ordinary shareholders. The principal inputs to the CMC  calculation include estimates of asset growth, the ratio of risk-weighted assets to total assets and the expected minimum regulatory  capital requirements. An increase in the CMC as a result of a change to these principal inputs would reduce VIU. Additionally,  management considers other factors, including qualitative factors, to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain appropriate. "}

This is based on a capital asset pricing model (‘CAPM’) calculation for BoCom, using market\ndata. Management also compares the rate derived from the CAPM with discount rates from external sources. The discount rate used\nis within the range of 10.3% to 15.0% (2019: 10.0% to 15.0%) indicated by external sources. The increased rate reflects the net\nimpact of updates to certain components of CAPM due to elevated levels of risk arising from the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and\nthe disruption to global economic activity.\n\ne Expected credit losses (‘ECL’) as a percentage of customer advances: This ranges from 0.98% to 1.22% (2019: 0.95%) in the short to\nmedium term, reflecting increases due to the Covid-19 outbreak and BoCom's actual results. For periods after 2024, the ratio is\n0.88% (2019: 0.76%), which is slightly higher than BoCom’s average ECL in recent years. This ratio was increased to reflect trends in\nBoCom’s actual results in recent years of increasing ECL and of changes to BoCom’s loan portfolio.\n\ne Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets: This ranges from 61% to 62% (2019: 61%) in the short to medium term,\nreflecting increases that may arise from higher ECL in the short term, followed by reductions that may arise from a subsequent\nlowering of ECL and a continuation of the trend of strong retail loan growth.

For periods after 2024, the rate is\n16.8% (2019: 22.5%), which is higher than the recent historical average. This rate was reduced on expectations of a lower effective\ntax rate in the long term, reflecting BoCom’s actual results in recent years and forecast financial asset composition, and forecasts\ndisclosed by external analysts.\n\n* Capital requirements: This was based on a capital adequacy ratio of 11.5% (2019: 11.5%) and tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 9.5%\n(2019: 9.5%), based on the minimum regulatory requirements.\n\nThe following table shows the change to each key assumption in the VIU calculation that on its own would reduce the headroom to nil:\n\nKey assumption Changes to key assumption to reduce headroom to nil\n¢ Long-term profit growth rate * Decrease by 22 basis points\n¢ Long-term asset growth rate ¢ Increase by 20 basis points\n¢ Discount rate ¢ Increase by 26 basis points\n« Expected credit losses as a percentage of customer advances * Increase by 3 basis points\n\n¢ Risk-weighted assets as a percentage of total assets ¢ Increase by 136 basis points.\n* Operating income growth rate * Decrease by 28 basis points\n* Cost-income ratio ¢ Increase by 77 basis points\n¢ Long-term effective tax rate ¢ Increase by 216 basis points.\n* Capital requirements — capital adequacy ratio ¢ Increase by 26 basis points\n* Capital requirements — tier 1 capital adequacy ratio ¢ Increase by 90 basis points\n\nThe following table further illustrates the impact on VIU of reasonably possible changes to key assumptions.

In June 2019, the merger between SABB and\nAlawwal bank (‘Alawwal’) became effective, which reduced HSBC's 40% interest in SABB to 29.2%. On 3 December 2020, HSBC\npurchased additional shares in SABB, which increased the Group’s shareholding to 31%.

As a\nresult, the Group performed an impairment test on the carrying amount, which confirmed no impairment. The recoverable amount as\ndetermined by a VIU calculation is $4.74bn.\n\nThe basis of recoverable amount\n\nThe impairment test was performed by comparing the recoverable amount of SABB, determined by a VIU calculation, with its carrying\namount. The VIU calculation uses discounted cash flow projections based on management's best estimates of future earnings available\nto ordinary shareholders prepared in accordance with IAS 36, which requires significant management judgement. A key component to\nthe VIU calculation is management's best estimate of SABB’s earnings, which is based on explicit forecasts over the short to medium\nterm. This reflects the uncertainty arising from the current economic outlook. Earnings beyond the short to medium term are then\nextrapolated in perpetuity using a long-term growth rate to derive a terminal value, which comprises the majority of the VIU.\nAdditionally, management considers other factors (including qualitative factors) to ensure that the inputs to the VIU calculation remain\nappropriate.\n\nKey assumptions in value-in-use calculation\nWe used a number of assumptions in our VIU calculation, in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36:\n\n¢ Long-term profit growth rate: 2.85% for periods after 2024. This does not exceed forecast GDP growth in Saudi Arabia.\n\n¢ Long-term asset growth rate: 2.85% for periods after 2024. This is the rate that assets are expected to grow to achieve long-term\nprofit growth of 2.85%.\n\n¢ Discount rate: 10.4%. This is based on a CAPM calculation for Saudi Arabia using market data. Management also compares the rate\nderived from the CAPM with cost of capital rates from external sources.\n\ne Management's judgement in estimating the cash flows of SABB: Cash flow projections have considered the scale of the entity\nfollowing the merger with Alawwal, current market conditions and our macroeconomic outlook.\n\nSensitivity of VIU to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions\n\nAt 31 December 2020, the Group’s investment in SABB was sensitive to reasonably possible adverse changes in key assumptions\nsupporting the recoverable amount. The most sensitive inputs to the impairment test are set out in the following table. A reasonable\nchange in a single key assumption may not result in impairment, although taken together a combination of reasonable changes in key\nassumptions could result in a recoverable amount that is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nKey assumption Reasonably possible change\n* Cash flow projections * Cash flow projections decrease by 15%.

Where it is deemed to be acting as principal rather than  agent in its role as investment manager, HSBC controls these funds. \nOther \nHSBC has entered into a number of transactions in the normal course of business, which include asset and structured finance  transactions where it has control of the structured entity. In addition, HSBC is deemed to control a number of third-party managed funds  through its involvement as a principal in the funds. \nUnconsolidated structured entities \nThe term ‘unconsolidated structured entities’ refers to all structured entities not controlled by HSBC. The Group enters into transactions  with unconsolidated structured entities in the normal course of business to facilitate customer transactions and for specific investment  opportunities. "}

HSBC Holdings also raises funds in the debt capital markets to meet the\nGroup’s minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. HSBC Holdings uses this liquidity to meet its obligations, including\ninterest and principal repayments on external debt liabilities, operating expenses and collateral on derivative transactions.\n\nHSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent liquidity risk by virtue of credit-related commitments and guarantees and similar contracts\nissued relating to its subsidiaries. Such commitments and guarantees are only issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings’ ability\nto finance the commitments and guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising.\n\nHSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding company level.\nDuring 2020, consistent with the Group’s capital plan, the Group’s subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying\ndividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or\npayments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things,\ntheir respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating\nperformance.\n\nHSBC Holdings currently has sufficient liquidity to meet its present requirements.\n\nLiquidity risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by Holdings ALCO. This risk arises because of HSBC Holdings’ obligation to make payments\nto debt holders as they fall due and to pay its operating expenses. The liquidity risk related to these cash flows is managed by matching\nexternal debt obligations with internal loan cash flows and by maintaining an appropriate liquidity buffer that is monitored by Holdings\nALCO.\n\nThe balances in the following table are not directly comparable with those on the balance sheet of HSBC Holdings as the table\nincorporates, on an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments (except for derivatives not\ntreated as hedging derivatives).

It is divided into two main parts: data as of December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. Each part lists various categories of financial obligations, such as deposits by banks, customer accounts, repurchase agreements, and others. These are further categorized by the time until they are due: due in not more than 1 month, over 1 month but not more than 3 months, and so on, up to due over 5 years. At the end of each main section, the total cash flows payable and their proportion in each period are summarized.\nHSBC Holdings \nHSBC Holdings’ primary sources of liquidity are dividends received from subsidiaries, interest on and repayment of intra-Group loans  and securities, and interest earned on its own liquid funds. HSBC Holdings also raises funds in the debt capital markets to meet the  Group’s minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities. HSBC Holdings uses this liquidity to meet its obligations, including  interest and principal repayments on external debt liabilities, operating expenses and collateral on derivative transactions. \nHSBC Holdings is also subject to contingent liquidity risk by virtue of credit-related commitments and guarantees and similar contracts  issued relating to its subsidiaries. Such commitments and guarantees are only issued after due consideration of HSBC Holdings’ ability  to finance the commitments and guarantees and the likelihood of the need arising. \nHSBC Holdings actively manages the cash flows from its subsidiaries to optimise the amount of cash held at the holding company level.  During 2020, consistent with the Group’s capital plan, the Group’s subsidiaries did not experience any significant restrictions on paying  dividends or repaying loans and advances. Also, there are no foreseen restrictions envisaged with regard to planned dividends or  payments. However, the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or advance monies to HSBC Holdings depends on, among other things,  their respective local regulatory capital and banking requirements, exchange controls, statutory reserves, and financial and operating  performance. \nHSBC Holdings currently has sufficient liquidity to meet its present requirements. \nLiquidity risk in HSBC Holdings is overseen by Holdings ALCO. This risk arises because of HSBC Holdings’ obligation to make payments  to debt holders as they fall due and to pay its operating expenses. The liquidity risk related to these cash flows is managed by matching  external debt obligations with internal loan cash flows and by maintaining an appropriate liquidity buffer that is monitored by Holdings  ALCO. \nThe balances in the following table are not directly comparable with those on the balance sheet of HSBC Holdings as the table  incorporates, on an undiscounted basis, all cash flows relating to principal and future coupon payments (except for derivatives not  treated as hedging derivatives). Undiscounted cash flows payable in relation to hedging derivative liabilities are classified according to  their contractual maturities. Derivatives not treated as hedging derivatives are included in the ‘On demand’ time bucket. \nIn addition, loan commitments and financial guarantees and similar contracts are generally not recognised on our balance sheet. The  undiscounted cash flows potentially payable under financial guarantees and similar contracts are classified on the basis of the earliest  date on which they can be called. "}

The trial concluded in February\n2017 and, in August 2017, the court dismissed all claims against the defendants. In September 2017, Primeo appealed to the Court of\nAppeal of the Cayman Islands and, in June 2019, the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands dismissed Primeo’s appeal. In August 2019,\nPrimeo filed a notice of appeal to the UK Privy Council, which has listed the first of two possible hearings for April 2021.\n\nLuxembourg litigation: In April 2009, Herald Fund SPC (’Herald’) (in liquidation since July 2013) brought an action against HSSL\nbefore the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of cash and securities that Herald purportedly lost because of Madoff\nSecurities’ fraud, or money damages. The Luxembourg District Court dismissed Herald's securities restitution claim, but reserved\nHerald’s cash restitution claim and its claim for money damages. Herald has appealed this judgment to the Luxembourg Court of\nAppeal, where the matter is pending. In late 2018, Herald brought additional claims against HSSL and HSBC Bank plc before the\nLuxembourg District Court, seeking further restitution and damages.\n\nIn October 2009, Alpha Prime Fund Limited (‘Alpha Prime’) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court,\nseeking the restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In December 2018, Alpha Prime brought additional\nclaims before the Luxembourg District Court seeking damages against various HSBC companies. These matters are currently pending\nbefore the Luxembourg District Court.\n\nIn December 2014, Senator Fund SPC (‘Senator’) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking\nrestitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In April 2015, Senator commenced a separate action against the\nLuxembourg branch of HSBC Bank plc asserting identical claims before the Luxembourg District Court.

In December 2018, the Irish High Court issued a judgment in HTIE’s favour on a preliminary issue, holding\nthat Defender Limited had no effective claim against HTIE. This judgment concluded the trial without further issues in dispute being\nheard. In February 2019, Defender Limited appealed the decision.

Based\nupon the information currently available, management's estimate of the possible aggregate damages that might arise as a result of all\nclaims in the various Madoff-related proceedings is up to or exceeding $500m, excluding costs and interest. Due to uncertainties and\nlimitations of this estimate, any possible damages that might ultimately arise could differ significantly from this amount.\n\nAnti-money laundering and sanctions-related matters\n\nIn December 2012, HSBC Holdings entered into a number of agreements, including an undertaking with the UK Financial Services\nAuthority (replaced with a Direction issued by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) in 2013 and again in 2020) as well as a cease-\nand-desist order with the US Federal Reserve Board (‘FRB’), both of which contained certain forward-looking anti-money laundering\n(‘AML’) and sanctions-related obligations. HSBC also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor (who was, for FCA purposes,\na ‘Skilled Person’ under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act and, for FRB purposes, an ‘Independent Consultant’) to\nproduce periodic assessments of the Group’s AML and sanctions compliance programme. In 2020, HSBC’s engagement with the\nindependent compliance monitor, acting in his roles as both Skilled Person and Independent Consultant, concluded. The role of FCA\nSkilled Person was assigned to a new individual in the second quarter of 2020. Separately, a new FRB Independent Consultant will be\nappointed pursuant to the cease-and-desist order.

(‘HSBC Bank USA’), HSBC North America Holdings Inc. and HSBC USA Inc. (the ‘Nominal Corporate Defendants’)\nin New York state court against certain current and former directors and officers of the Nominal Corporate Defendants (the ‘Individual\nDefendants’). The complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Nominal Corporate Defendants\nand caused a waste of corporate assets by allegedly permitting and/or causing the conduct underlying the five-year deferred prosecution\nagreement with the US Department of Justice (‘DoJ’), entered into in December 2012. In November 2015, the New York state court\ngranted the Nominal Corporate Defendants’ motion to dismiss, but the appellate court reversed the decision in November 2018 and\nreinstated the action. In June 2020, the parties reached an agreement to resolve this derivative action, under which HSBC has received a\npayment from directors and officers liability insurance providers and will continue for a period of time certain corporate governance\npractices. In November 2020, the court issued an order granting final settlement approval and dismissing the action. This matter is now\nconcluded.\n\nSince November 2014, a number of lawsuits have been filed in federal courts in the US against various HSBC companies and others on\nbehalf of plaintiffs who are, or are related to, victims of terrorist attacks in the Middle East or of cartel violence in Mexico. In each case, it\nis alleged that the defendants aided and abetted the unlawful conduct of various sanctioned parties in violation of the US Anti-Terrorism\nAct. Currently, 10 actions remain pending in federal courts in New York or the District of Columbia. In March, September and October\n2019, the courts granted HSBC's motions to dismiss in three of these cases. In October 2020, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal\nof one of the actions on appeal. An appeal remains pending in another case, and plaintiffs are seeking certification to appeal in the third\ncase. HSBC filed motions to dismiss in three further cases, with two of the motions granted in June 2020, and the third granted in\nNovember 2020. These dismissals are subject to appeal.

The deadline for service of the claim has been  extended to September 2021 for UK-based defendants and November 2021 for all other defendants. \nCayman Islands litigation:  In February 2013, Primeo Fund (‘Primeo’) (in liquidation since April 2009) brought an action against HSBC  Securities Services Luxembourg (‘HSSL’) and Bank of Bermuda (Cayman) Limited (now known as HSBC Cayman Limited), alleging  breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty and claiming damages and equitable compensation. The trial concluded in February  2017 and, in August 2017, the court dismissed all claims against the defendants. In September 2017, Primeo appealed to the Court of  Appeal of the Cayman Islands and, in June 2019, the Court of Appeal of the Cayman Islands dismissed Primeo’s appeal. In August 2019,  Primeo filed a notice of appeal to the UK Privy Council, which has listed the first of two possible hearings for April 2021. \nLuxembourg litigation:  In April 2009, Herald Fund SPC (‘Herald’) (in liquidation since July 2013) brought an action against HSSL  before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking restitution of cash and securities that Herald purportedly lost because of Madoff  Securities’ fraud, or money damages. The Luxembourg District Court dismissed Herald’s securities restitution claim, but reserved  Herald’s cash restitution claim and its claim for money damages. Herald has appealed this judgment to the Luxembourg Court of  Appeal, where the matter is pending. In late 2018, Herald brought additional claims against HSSL and HSBC Bank plc before the  Luxembourg District Court, seeking further restitution and damages. \nIn October 2009, Alpha Prime Fund Limited (‘Alpha Prime’) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court,  seeking the restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In December 2018, Alpha Prime brought additional  claims before the Luxembourg District Court seeking damages against various HSBC companies. These matters are currently pending  before the Luxembourg District Court. \nIn December 2014, Senator Fund SPC (‘Senator’) brought an action against HSSL before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking  restitution of securities, or the cash equivalent, or money damages. In April 2015, Senator commenced a separate action against the  Luxembourg branch of HSBC Bank plc asserting identical claims before the Luxembourg District Court. In December 2018, Senator  brought additional claims against HSSL and HSBC Bank plc Luxembourg branch before the Luxembourg District Court, seeking  restitution of Senator’s securities or money damages. These matters are currently pending before the Luxembourg District Court. \nIreland litigation:  In November 2013, Defender Limited brought an action against HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited  (‘HTIE’) and others, based on allegations of breach of contract and claiming damages and indemnification for fund losses. The trial  commenced in October 2018. In December 2018, the Irish High Court issued a judgment in HTIE’s favour on a preliminary issue, holding  that Defender Limited had no effective claim against HTIE. This judgment concluded the trial without further issues in dispute being  heard. In February 2019, Defender Limited appealed the decision. In July 2020, the Irish Supreme Court ruled in part in favour of  Defender Limited and returned the case to the High Court for further proceedings, which will resume in April 2021. \nThere are many factors that may affect the range of possible outcomes, and any resulting financial impact, of the various Madoff-related  proceedings described above, including but not limited to the multiple jurisdictions in which the proceedings have been brought. Based  upon the information currently available, management’s estimate of the possible aggregate damages that might arise as a result of all  claims in the various Madoff-related proceedings is up to or exceeding   $\\mathbb{S500m}$  , excluding costs and interest. Due to uncertainties and  limitations of this estimate, any possible damages that might ultimately arise could differ significantly from this amount. \nAnti-money laundering and sanctions-related matters \nIn December 2012, HSBC Holdings entered into a number of agreements, including an undertaking with the UK Financial Services  Authority (replaced with a Direction issued by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) in 2013 and again in 2020) as well as a cease- and-desist order with the US Federal Reserve Board (‘FRB’), both of which contained certain forward-looking anti-money laundering  (‘AML’) and sanctions-related obligations. HSBC also agreed to retain an independent compliance monitor (who was, for FCA purposes,  a ‘Skilled Person’ under section 166 of the Financial Services and Markets Act and, for FRB purposes, an ‘Independent Consultant’) to  produce periodic assessments of the Group’s AML and sanctions compliance programme. In 2020, HSBC’s engagement with the  independent compliance monitor, acting in his roles as both Skilled Person and Independent Consultant, concluded. The role of FCA  Skilled Person was assigned to a new individual in the second quarter of 2020. Separately, a new FRB Independent Consultant will be  appointed pursuant to the cease-and-desist order.

It is possible that additional civil actions will be initiated against HSBC in relation to  its historical foreign exchange activities. \nThere are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact, of these matters, which could be  significant. \nPrecious metals fix-related litigation \nGold:  Beginning in March 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District Court and the US District Courts for  the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of California, naming HSBC and other members of The London Gold Market Fixing  Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2004 to June 2013, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of  gold and gold derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. The actions  were consolidated in the New York District Court. The defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated action was granted in part and  denied in part in October 2016. In June 2017, the court granted the plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint, naming a new  defendant. In October 2020, HSBC reached a settlement in principle with the plaintiffs to resolve the consolidated action. The settlement  remains subject to court approval. \nBeginning in December 2015, numerous putative class actions under Canadian law were filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts  of Justice against various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. The plaintiffs allege that, among other things, from January  2004 to March 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of gold and gold derivatives in violation of the Canadian  Competition Act and common law. These actions are ongoing. \nSilver:  Beginning in July 2014, numerous putative class actions were filed in federal district courts in New York, naming HSBC and  other members of The London Silver Market Fixing Limited as defendants. The complaints allege that, from January 2007 to December  2013, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives for their collective benefit in violation of US  antitrust laws, the US CEA and New York state law. The actions were consolidated in the New York District Court. The defendants’  motion to dismiss the consolidated action was granted in part and denied in part in October 2016. In June 2017, the court granted the  plaintiffs leave to file a third amended complaint, which names several new defendants. The court has denied the pre-existing  defendants’ request for leave to file a joint motion to dismiss, and discovery is proceeding. \nIn April 2016, two putative class actions under Canadian law were filed in the Ontario and Quebec Superior Courts of Justice against  various HSBC companies and other financial institutions. The plaintiffs in both actions allege that, from January 1999 to August 2014,  the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of silver and silver derivatives in violation of the Canadian Competition Act and  common law. These actions are ongoing. \nPlatinum and palladium:  Between late 2014 and early 2015, numerous putative class actions were filed in the New York District  Court, naming HSBC and other members of The London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Limited as defendants. The complaints  allege that, from January 2008 to November 2014, the defendants conspired to manipulate the price of platinum group metals (‘PGM’)  and PGM-based financial products for their collective benefit in violation of US antitrust laws and the US CEA. In March 2017, the  defendants’ motion to dismiss the second amended consolidated complaint was granted in part and denied in part. In June 2017, the  plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In March 2020, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the third amended  complaint but granted the plaintiffs leave to re-plead certain claims. The plaintiffs have filed an appeal. \nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable at this time for HSBC to predict the resolution of these matters, including the  timing or any possible impact on HSBC, which could be significant. \nFilm finance litigation \nIn July and November 2015, two actions were brought by individuals against HSBC Private Bank (UK) Limited (‘PBGB’) in the High Court  of England and Wales seeking damages on various alleged grounds, including breach of duty to the claimants, in connection with their  participation in certain Ingenious film finance schemes. These actions are ongoing.  \nIn December 2018, a separate action was brought against PBGB in the High Court of England and Wales by multiple claimants seeking  damages for alleged unlawful means conspiracy and dishonest assistance in connection with lending provided by PBGB to third parties  in respect of certain Ingenious film finance schemes in which the claimants participated. In June 2019, a similar claim was issued  against PBGB in the High Court of England and Wales by additional claimants. These actions are ongoing. \nIn June 2020, two separate claims were issued against HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to PBGB’s business) by two separate groups of  investors in Eclipse film finance schemes in connection with PBGB’s role in the development of such schemes. These matters are at an  early stage. \nIn February 2020, a claim was issued against HSBC UK Bank plc (as successor to PBGB’s business) by two individuals in relation to the  Zeus film finance schemes. The claimants failed to serve the claim on time, and this claim has now lapsed. Separately, in June 2020,  HSBC UK Bank plc received an application for disclosure of documents by a law firm acting on behalf of a number of investors in the  Zeus film finance schemes. This application was dismissed by the court in November 2020. \nIt is possible that additional actions or investigations will be initiated against HSBC UK Bank plc as a result of PBGB’s historical  involvement in the provision of certain film finance-related services. \nBased on the facts currently known, it is not practicable to predict the resolution of these matters, including the timing or any possible  impact on HSBC, which could be significant.

Here are the entries:\n\n1. **Announcement** - 23 February 2021\n2. **Shares quoted ex-dividend** in London, Hong Kong, Bermuda, and American Depositary Shares (ADS) quoted ex-dividend in New York - 11 March 2021\n3. **Record date** for London, Hong Kong, New York, Bermuda - 12 March 2021\n4. **Mailing of Annual Report and Accounts 2020 and/or Strategic Report 2020 and dividend documentation** - 24 March 2021\n5. **Final date for receipt by registrars** of forms of election, Investor Centre electronic instructions, and revocations of standing instructions for dividend elections - 15 April 2021\n6. **Exchange rate determined** for payment of dividends in sterling and Hong Kong dollars - 19 April 2021\n7. **Payment date** - 29 April 2021\nInterim dividends for 2021 \nIn December 2020, the PRA announced that it intends to transition back to its standard approach to capital setting and shareholder  distributions through 2021. In the meantime, for 2021 dividends the PRA is content for appropriately prudent dividends to be accrued but  not paid out and the PRA aims to provide a further update ahead of the 2021 half-year results of large UK banks. As a result, the Group  will not be paying quarterly dividends during 2021 but will consider whether to announce an interim dividend at the 2021 half-year results  in August. \nThe Group will review whether to revert to paying quarterly dividends at or ahead of its 2021 results announcement in February 2022.  \nThe Board has adopted a policy designed to provide sustainable dividends going forward. We intend to transition towards a target payout  ratio of between  $40\\%$   and  $55\\%$   of reported earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’) for 2022 onwards, with the flexibility to adjust EPS for non- cash significant items such as goodwill or intangibles impairments. The dividend policy could be supplemented by buy-backs or special  dividends, over time and not in the near term, should the Group find itself in an excess capital position absent compelling investment  opportunities to deploy that excess. \nDividends are declared in US dollars and, at the election of the shareholder, paid in cash in one of, or in a combination of, US dollars,  pounds sterling and Hong Kong dollars. The Group has decided to discontinue the scrip dividend option as it is dilutive, including to  dividend per share progression over time. \nOther equity instruments \nAdditional tier 1 capital – contingent convertible securities \nHSBC continues to issue contingent convertible securities that are included in its capital base as fully CRR II-compliant additional tier 1  capital securities. For further details on these securities, please refer to Note 31 on the financial statements.  \nIn 2020, HSBC issued  $\\S1{,}500\\mathsf{m}\\ 4.600\\%$   Perpetual Contingent Convertible Securities on 17 December 2020.  \n2020 Annual General Meeting \nAll resolutions considered at the 2020 Annual General Meeting held at 11:00 am on 24 April 2020 at 8 Canada Square, London E14 5HQ,  UK were passed on a poll.

For US tax purposes, a US holder must include cash  dividends paid on the shares or ADSs in ordinary income on the  date that such holder or the ADS depositary receives them,  translating dividends paid in UK pounds sterling into US dollars  using the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt. A US  holder that elects to receive shares in lieu of a cash dividend must  include in ordinary income the fair market value of such shares on  the dividend payment date, and the tax basis of those shares will  equal such fair market value.
