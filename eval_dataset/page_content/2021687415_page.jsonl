Therefore, the safety  performance of vehicles needs to be further improved as part of an integrated road safety  approach and in order to protect vulnerable road users better.  \nThe update of vehicle safety requirements is part of the “Europe on the Move” package of the  European Commission to achieve a mobility system that is “safe, clean and efficient for all  EU citizens.” 8   \nII.  Development and Installation of Car Crash Avoidance Systems  \nA.   Approval and Oversight  \nManufacturers apply for type-approval or individual vehicle approval with the competent  approval authorities of the EU Member States.  They must ensure that the vehicle complies with  all relevant requirements applicable at the time of production and issue a certificate of conformity   to accompany each vehicle.  Type-approval is granted by the approval authority if the type of  vehicle, system, component, or separate technical unit satisfies the relevant administrative  provisions and technical requirements under EU legislation.  The type approval can be either  EU-wide, meaning the vehicle complies with all relevant EU administrative provisions and  technical requirements, or restricted to the territory of an EU Member State, meaning all national  requirements are fulfilled.

The Department provides a summary list of the ADRs applicable to different  categories of passenger vehicles (M–Category Vehicles),  including, for example, ADR 42 on  General Safety Requirements,  ADR 69 on Full Frontal Impact Occupant Protection,  ADR 89  on Brake Assist Systems,  ADR 90 on Steering System,  and ADR 94 on Audible Warning.   \nThe current ADRs for light vehicles do not mandate specific systems for avoiding collisions with  pedestrians and cyclists, such as autonomous emergency braking systems, lane keeping and lane  departure warning systems, blind spot monitoring and warning systems, and forward collision  warning and avoidance systems.   \nANCAP notes that   \n[t]he ADRs do not prevent the introduction of new safety technology. For example, the  majority of new passenger cars, SUVs and light commercial vehicles (LCVs) are now being  sold in Australia with autonomous emergency braking (AEB) well ahead of the  introduction of any ADR. Other new safety technology, such as lane keeping assist (LKA),  is also provided in new vehicle models, again without any regulatory requirement.   \nCurrently, ANCAP evaluates new vehicles against four key areas: Adult Occupant Protection,  Child Occupant Protection, Vulnerable Road User Protection, and Safety Assist. The Vulnerable  Road User Protection area assesses AEB systems with respect to their ability to actively avoid or  mitigate impacts with pedestrians and cyclists. The Safety Assist area includes assessments of  lane departure warning, lane keeping assist, and lane support systems, among others.   "}

The  mandate for crash avoidance and pedestrian recognition equipment on vehicles used  in mines has been repealed.     \nI.  Introduction  \nSeveral laws regulate road and traffic safety in Russia. The work of federal executive authorities  in the field of road safety is coordinated at the ministerial level by the State Commission for  Road Safety.     \nThe Federal Road Safety Program for 2013–2020 was implemented by the Ministry of Transport, which is the federal agency that ensures transportation safety in all 85 constituent components of  the Russian Federation.  On January 8, 2018, the government of the Russian Federation adopted  the Road Safety Strategy of the Russian Federation 2018-2024.  These documents promote  technological solutions for road safety problems and introduce the notion of an “intelligent  transport system” consisting of integrated informational, digital, and remote technological  capabilities. Except for antilock brake systems (ABS), however, crash and collision avoidance  systems are not recognized as required elements yet, and their installation on new Russian and  imported cars is not mandated.

General Framework Regarding Type Approval of Motor Vehicles, Systems, and\nComponents\n\nSince the establishment of the European Union-Turkey Customs Union in 1996, the Turkish legal\nframework regarding type approvals of land motor vehicles has been harmonized with the\nrelevant European Union (EU) framework.’ The Law on Highway Traffic authorizes the Ministry\nof Industry and Technology (MIT) to issue regulations regarding the technical standards and type\napproval systems to ensure the roadworthiness of vehicles at the manufacturing stage.®\nAccordingly, the MIT has issued numerous regulations harmonizing Turkish law with the EU\nframework concerning type approvals of land vehicles. The EU framework provides the technical\nspecifications a manufacturer of motor vehicles must satisfy in its whole-vehicles, vehicle\nsystems, components, or separate technical units that it manufactures in order to obtain an EU\ntype approval for these products.? An EU type approval allows the manufacturer to market these\nproducts, and an importer to import them, within the EU and within the EU-Turkey Customs\nUnion without needing to recertify in each member state.1!° The EU framework incorporates\nspecific technical standards issued by the European Commission and certain technical\nregulations created by the UNECE; some series of UNECE regulations are considered equivalent\nand acceptable alternatives for compliance with EU standards for type approvals and free\nmovement of approved products. 4\n\nIn Turkish law, the framework currently in force governing the type approval and market\nsurveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, systems, components, and separate technical\nunits is set forth in MIT’s framework regulation transposing Regulation (EU) 2018/858.!2 In\naddition to this, two other MIT framework regulations transpose Regulations (EU) 167/2013 and\n168/2013, which concern type approvals and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry\n\nfor Reciprocal Recognition of Approvals Granted on the Basis of these United Nations Regulations, Mar. 20,\n1958, 335 U.N.T:S. 211, https:/ / perma.cc/U85X-23EY, ratified by Council of Ministers Decision No. 96/8657\n(Official Gazette [O.G.] No. 22868, Jan. 5, 1997), https: / / perma.cc/ VV82-9XM8; Agreement Concerning the\nEstablishing of Global Technical Regulations for Wheeled Vehicles, Equipment and Parts Which Can be Fitted\nand/or be Used on Wheeled Vehicles, June 25, 1998, 2119 U.N.T.S. 129, https:/ / perma.cc/8CRR-6QTF, ratified\nby Council of Ministers Decision No. 2000/1318 (O.G.

General Framework Regarding Type Approval of Motor Vehicles, Systems, and  Components  \nSince the establishment of the European Union-Turkey Customs Union in 1996, the Turkish legal  framework regarding type approvals of land motor vehicles has been harmonized with the  relevant European Union (EU) framework.  The Law on Highway Traffic authorizes the Ministry  of Industry and Technology (MIT) to issue regulations regarding the technical standards and type  approval systems to ensure the roadworthiness of vehicles at the manufacturing stage.   Accordingly, the MIT has issued numerous regulations harmonizing Turkish law with the EU  framework concerning type approvals of land vehicles. The EU framework provides the technical  specifications a manufacturer of motor vehicles must satisfy in its whole-vehicles, vehicle  systems, components, or separate technical units that it manufactures in order to obtain an EU  type approval for these products.  An EU type approval allows the manufacturer to market these  products, and an importer to import them, within the EU and within the EU-Turkey Customs  Union without needing to recertify in each member state.  The EU framework incorporates  specific technical standards issued by the European Commission and certain technical  regulations created by the UNECE; some series of UNECE regulations are considered equivalent  and acceptable alternatives for compliance with EU standards for type approvals and free  movement of approved products.    \nIn Turkish law, the framework currently in force governing the type approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, systems, components, and separate technical  units is set forth in MIT’s framework regulation transposing Regulation (EU) 2018/858.  In  addition to this, two other MIT framework regulations transpose Regulations (EU) 167/2013 and  168/2013, which concern type approvals and market surveillance of agricultural and forestry  vehicles, and two- or three- wheeled vehicles and quadricycles, respectively.  These three MIT  framework regulations are complemented by the Regulation on the Manufacturing, Repair, and  Assembly of Vehicles, which governs the national type approval system for vehicles that are not  required to be certified under the harmonized EU type approval rules.

Enforcement activity is carried out through reacting to complaints, testing of  products at approved test facilities, monitoring of information and products at point of  sale, and monitoring of advertisements. The form of enforcement action used will differ  depending on the nature of the non-compliance, the harm caused and the history of the  responsible person or business. DVSA are therefore not restricted to taking the least formal  enforcement action in the first instance and will consider what immediate action is needed  to protect consumer interests, including where necessary, prosecution.
