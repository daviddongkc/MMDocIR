They tried to make marketing, operations or finance all work well. Some 30  years ago managers recognized that simply optimizing functions within a company wasn’t adequate. They had to  find a way to optimize the total firm. Therefore, concepts such as “reengineering the corporation” advanced the  kind of cross-functional process thinking that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s. They “broke down silos”  and implemented process thinking.    •   As good as these efforts were, today’s enlightened companies are recognizing that when a company purchases   $50\\%$   to  $70\\%$   of the cost of its final product from outside suppliers, there is a limit as to how well you can make  your individual company perform. If a company really is to manage its total costs, quality, cycle time, and even  technology, it needs to be able to manage its supply chains, logistics and transportation. And, managing a supply  chain and logistics means not just your direct suppliers, but their suppliers, right down sometimes to the most  basic raw materials. As a result, supply chain management (SCM) and logistics is now becoming mandatory at  many companies.
