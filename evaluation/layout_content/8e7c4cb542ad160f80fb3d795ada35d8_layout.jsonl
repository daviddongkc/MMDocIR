These  findings have several important implica- tions. The fact the upzonings took place in  areas with average levels of development  may signal that the upzonings will have to  lead, rather than follow, the market. It may  be appropriate for upzonings to try to chan- nel growth into areas where the market has  not yet signaled interest if, for example, the  City believes infrastructure in those areas is  underused, or if the City plans to upgrade  infrastructure it believes was holding devel- opment back.
