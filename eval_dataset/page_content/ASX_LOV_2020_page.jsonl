While the costs and time that would be\nrequired to replicate Lovisa’s business model, design team,\nIT systems, store network, warehouse facilities and level of\nbrand recognition would be substantial, the industry as a\nwhole has relatively low barriers to entry. The industry is\nalso subject to ever changing customer preferences.\n\nLovisa’s current competitors include:\n\n© specialty retailers selling predominately fashion\njewellery;\n\n© department stores;\n\n© fashion apparel retailers with a fashion jewellery\nsection; and\n\n© smaller retailers (i.e. less than five stores) that specialise\nin the affordable jewellery segment.\n\nCompetition is based on a variety of factors including\nmerchandise selection, price, advertising, new stores,\nstore location, store appearance, product presentation and\ncustomer service.\n\nLovisa’s competitive position may deteriorate as a result of\nfactors including actions by existing competitors, the entry\nof new competitors (such as international retailers or online\nretailers) or a failure by Lovisa to successfully respond to\nchanges in the industry.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, Lovisa employs a product team of more\nthan 20 people to meet market demands as described in\nsection 5.1. Management believe it would take a number\nof years for a new entrant to establish a portfolio of leases\ncomparable with Lovisa in premium store locations due to\nsubstantial barrier to entry costs as detailed above.\n\n6.3 Retail Environment and General Economic Conditions\n\nAs Lovisa’s products are typically viewed by consumers\nto be ‘discretionary’ items rather than ‘necessities’,\nLovisa’s financial performance is sensitive to the current\nstate of, and future changes in, the retail environment\nin the countries in which it operates. However, with a\nlow average retail spend per transaction, macro market\nperformance has minimal impact for Lovisa.\n\nLovisa’s main strategy to overcome any downturn in the\nretail environment or economic conditions is to continue\n\nto offer our customers quality, affordable and on trend\nproducts. The current global situation in relation to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has had a larger impact on the\nbusiness than normally seen as a result of macro market\nconditions, with the unprecedented scale of its impact on\nall aspects of people’s lives, and in particular the inability\nfor people to socialise in normal ways, having a continued\nimpact on trading conditions.\n\n6.4 Failure to Successfully Implement Growth Strategies\nLovisa’s growth strategy is based on its ability to increase\nearnings contributions from existing stores and continue to\nopen and operate new stores on a timely and profitable\n\nbasis. This includes the opening of new stores in both Australia\nand overseas.\n\nLovisa’s store roll-out program is dependent on securing\n\nstores in suitable locations on acceptable terms, and may\n\nbe impacted by factors including delays, cost overruns and\n\ndisputes with landlords.\n\nThe following risks apply to the roll out program:\n\nnew stores opened by Lovisa may be unprofitable;\nLovisa may be unable to source new stores in preferred\n\nareas, and this could reduce Lovisa’s ability to continue to\nexpand its store footprint;\n\nnew stores may reduce revenues of existing stores; and\n© establishment costs may be greater than budgeted for.\n\nFactors mitigating these risks are that fitout costs are low with\nminimal standard deviation in setup costs across sites and\nterritories through our small store format and homogeneous\nstore layout, minimising potential downside for new stores.\nThe Group assesses store performance regularly and evaluates\nstore proximity and likely impact on other Lovisa stores as part\nof its roll-out planning.\n\nWhen entering new markets, Lovisa assesses the region, which\ninvolves building knowledge by leveraging a local network of\nindustry contacts, and aims to secure a portfolio of stores in\norder to launch an operating footprint upon entry. The Group\nplans to remain nimble and opportunistic in expanding and\nmoving into new markets, such that if opportunities arise,\n\nthe Group may accelerate its plans to enter a new market\n\nor continue to grow an existing market.

Current conditions in the global\nretail leasing market as a result of the impact of COVID-19\nare being monitored closely by management to ensure that\nopportunities are identified and taken advantage of as they\narise.\n\n6.5 Exchange Rates\n\nThe majority of inventory purchases that are imported by\nLovisa are priced in USD. Consequently, Lovisa is exposed to\nmovements in the exchange rate in the markets it operates in.\nAdverse movements could have an adverse impact on Lovisa’s\ngross profit margin.\n\nThe Group’s foreign exchange policy is aimed at managing its\nforeign currency exposure in order to protect profit margins by\nentering into forward exchange contracts specifically against\nmovements in the USD rate against the AUD associated with its\ncost of goods. The Group does not currently hedge its foreign\ncurrency earnings. The Group monitors its working capital in\nits foreign subsidiaries to ensure exposure to movements in\ncurrency is limited.\n\n6.6 Prevailing Fashions and Consumer Preferences May\nChange\n\nLovisa’s revenues are entirely generated from the retailing of\njewellery, which is subject to changes in prevailing fashions\nand consumer preferences. Failure by Lovisa to predict or\nrespond to such changes could adversely impact the future\nfinancial performance of Lovisa.

The Directors are satisfied that  the provision of non-audit services by the auditor did not  compromise the auditor independence requirements of the  Corporations Act 2001 for the following reasons:\n\n \n•\t all non-audit services have been reviewed by the Audit,  Business Risk and Compliance Committee to ensure  they do not impact the impartiality and objectivity of the  auditor; and\n\n \n•\t none of the services undermine the general principles  relating to auditor independence as set out in APES 110  Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.   \n12. PROCEEDINGS ON BEHALF OF  COMPANY \nNo person has applied to the Court under section  237 of the Corporations Act 2001 for leave to bring  proceedings on behalf of the Company, or to intervene in  any proceedings to which the Company is a party, for the  purpose of taking responsibility on behalf of the Company  for all or part of those proceedings. \nNo proceedings have been brought or intervened in on  behalf of the Company with leave of the Court under  section 237 of the Corporations Act 2001. \n13. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION \nThe Company’s operations are not subject to any significant  environmental regulations under either Commonwealth  or State legislation. However, the Directors believe that  the Company has adequate systems in place for the  management of its environmental requirements and is not  aware of any breach of these environmental requirements  as they apply to the entity. \n14. NON-IFRS FINANCIAL  INFORMATION \nThis report contains certain non-IFRS financial measures of  historical financial performance. The measures are used by  management and the Directors for the purpose of assessing  the financial performance of the Group and individual  segments. The measures are also used to enhance the  comparability of information between reporting periods  by adjusting for non-recurring or controllable factors which  affect IFRS measures, to aid the user in understanding the  Group’s performance. These measures are not subject to  audit. \n15. ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS \nThe Group is of a kind referred to in ASIC Corporations  (Rounding in Financial/Directors’ Reports) Instrument  2016/191 issued by the Australian Securities and  Investments Commission, relating to the ‘rounding off’ of  amounts in the Directors’ report. Amounts in the Directors’  Report have been rounded off in accordance with that  Instrument to the nearest thousand dollars, or in certain  cases, to the nearest dollar. \nSigned in accordance with a resolution of the Directors \n\nBrett Blundy\t \t Non-Executive Chairman\t \nThe image contains a signature.\nShane Fallscheer  Managing Director \nMelbourne, 25 August 2020 "}

If a lease renewal is\n\nbeing actively sought and the lease renewal terms are reasonably known, the lease term has been adjusted to include the\n\nexpected renewal term.

Right-of-use assets have been adjusted for the re-measurement of lease liabilities due to  changes to existing lease terms, including extensions to existing lease terms. \nThe Group has applied the IFRIC agenda decision, released in November  $2019,$   clarifying how the lease term should be  determined for arragements that automatically renew until one of the parties gives notice to terminate. If a lease renewal is  being actively sought and the lease renewal terms are reasonably known, the lease term has been adjusted to include the  expected renewal term. If a lease renewal is not being sought, for example because the store will be relocated to a new  location, the lease term has not been adjusted and the lease has not been recognised on the balance sheet.          \nAt 28 June 2020, the Group has executed leases for which the lease commencement date has not yet occurred.

If any such indication exists then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated in line with the calculation  methodology listed below. \nCash-generating units \nAn impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable  amount.

It reflects the potential effects of strengthening or weakening of four currencies: Singapore Dollar (SGD), United States Dollar (USD), British Pound (GBP), and South African Rand (ZAR), for two different dates—28 June 2020 and 30 June 2019.\n\nFor 28 June 2020:\n- SGD: A strengthening results in a loss of 27, while a weakening results in a gain of 58.\n- USD: A strengthening results in a loss of 170, while a weakening results in a gain of 188.\n- GBP: A strengthening results in a loss of 261, while a weakening results in a gain of 288.\n- ZAR: A strengthening results in a loss of 180, while a weakening results in a gain of 199.\n\nFor 30 June 2019:\n- SGD: A strengthening results in a loss of 42, while a weakening results in a gain of 53.\n- USD: A strengthening results in a gain of 8, while a weakening results in a loss of 9.\n- GBP: A strengthening results in a gain of 51, while a weakening results in a loss of 56.\n- ZAR: A strengthening results in a loss of 718, while a weakening results in a gain of 794.\n\nOverall, the table outlines how fluctuations in exchange rates could impact financial outcomes, providing insight into currency exposure for the two years analyzed.\nThe Group is subject to exposure to interest rate risk as changes in interest rates will impact borrowings which bear interest  at floating rates. Any increase in interest rates will impact Lovisa’s costs of servicing these borrowings which may adversely  impact its financial position. This impact is not assessed to be material. \nIncreases in interest rates may also affect consumer sentiment and the level of customer demand, potentially leading to a  decrease in consumer spending. \nExposure to interest rate risk \nThe interest rate profile of the Group’s interest-bearing financial instruments as reported to the management of the Group is  as follows: \nThe table titled \"Consolidated ($000s)\" displays nominal amounts for variable-rate instruments.\n\n- In 2020, the table shows a nominal amount of zero for financial liabilities.\n- In 2019, the table shows a nominal amount of 7,988 for financial liabilities.\nAt 28 June 2020, if interest rates had changed by  $+/.$   100 basis points from the year end rates with all other variables  held constant, there would have been nil impact on pre tax profit for the year (30 June  $2019$  :   $\\S4\\,]$  ,000 impact), as a result  of higher/lower interest expense from variable rate borrowings. There is no impact on equity.  \n(c) Derivative assets and liabilities \nThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to manage its foreign currency risk exposures. \nRecognition and measurement \nDerivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are  recognised in profit or loss as they are incurred. Subsequent to initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are  measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss. \nDetermination of fair values \nA number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both financial and  non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and / or disclosure purposes based  on the following methods. \nForward rate contracts \nThe fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their quoted price, if available. If a quoted price is not available,  then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward  price for the residual maturity of the contract using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds).

The Group sells fashion\njewellery and is therefore subject to\nchanging consumer demands and\nfashion trends. This increases the risk\nthat, as trends change, products may\neither need to be sold at a discount\nbelow their recorded cost, or ultimately\ndisposed of for zero value. Estimating\nthe level of provisioning for obsolete\ninventory by the Group at product\nlevel, and therefore the value of\ninventories, requires consideration of\nthe ageing and condition of products\non hand, historic trends in write-offs,\ninventory turnover, seasonality of\ninventory and anticipated future sales.\nSuch judgements may have a\nsignificant impact on the Group’s\nprovisioning, and therefore the overall\ncarrying value of inventories,\nnecessitating our audit effort thereon.\n\nGroup’s policy for the shrinkage\nprovision is calculated based on the\ninventory counts performed and\nexpected misappropriation of\ninventories as a percentage of sales.\nWe focus on the shrinkage\nprovisioning calculation which is largely\nmanual and is therefore at greater risk\nof error.\n\nOur procedures included:\n\nEvaluating the appropriateness of the Group’s inventory\nprovisioning policies against the requirements of the\naccounting standards.\n\nAssessing the historical accuracy of the Group’s\ninventory provision against actual outcomes, to inform\nour evaluation of the current year provisioning and key\njudgements;\n\nChallenging the Group's judgements within their\nobsolete inventory provisioning, particularly the extent\nto which aged and seasonal inventory can be sold,\ntaking into account our knowledge of the industry and\npast Group performance;\n\nAnalysing current and historic trends in inventory\nturnover and ageing to identify indicators of slow-\nmoving or obsolete inventory and therefore those\ninventory items at higher risk of obsolescence. We\ncompared this to the Group's inventory ageing report.\n\nChecking the integrity of the Group’s inventory ageing\nreport at 28 June 2020, as a key input used in the\nobsolete inventory provisioning, by comparing on a\nsample basis inventory age per the report to purchase\ninvoices.\n\nAttending a sample of inventory counts across the\nGroup’s store and warehouse locations\n\n- to observe the condition of a sample of products held.\nWe did this to check the condition of products assumed\nin their recorded inventory value.\n\n- to observe the Group’s shrinkage process.\n\nAnalysing the inventory shrinkage provision levels by\nregion against sales, including against historical trends.\n\nAssessing the integrity of the provisioning calculations.\nThis included checking the accuracy of the formulas\nwithin the calculations.\n\nComparing a statistical sample of inventory product\nvalues recorded by the Group at year-end, to the\nGroup’s post year-end recommended retail selling prices\nto identify products at risk of selling below cost.\n\nLovisa Holdings Limited Annual Report - 28 June 2020\n", "vlm_text": "INDEPENDENT AUDIT REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF  LOVISA HOLDINGS LIMITED (CONTINUED) \n\nKey Audit Matters  \nKey Audit Matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in  our audit of the Financial Report of the current period.  \nThis matter was addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Report as a whole, and in  forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on this matter.   \nValuation of Inventories (\\$21.7m)  \nRefer to Note B2 to the Financial Report  \nThe table presented outlines a key audit matter regarding the evaluation of inventories within a Group, primarily focused on fashion jewelry and related inventory risks.
