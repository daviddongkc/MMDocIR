There is also a banner nearby with \"NUS Day of Service\" written on it. The atmosphere seems to be a public or educational event related to community service.\nGREEN NUS  \nOur environmental student groups  play a big part in promoting campus  sustainability and acting as a catalyst  for change in areas such as resource  consumption and sustainable lifestyles. \nThe image shows an icon of a shirt within an orange circle. The shirt is depicted with long sleeves and a pocket on the left side.\nGREEN BAZAAR \nTo promote responsible  consumption, yearly or biannual  clothing swap events are  organised for students and staff to  exchange secondhand items. \n The surplus items are donated \n to student-run projects and \n other causes. \nThe image shows a white line drawing of a divided food container or tray on an orange circular background.\nPROJECTS \n BOX AND TUMBLER \nProjects Box and Tumbler were  introduced in NUS canteens and  other selected food and beverage  outlets in 2010 and 2012  respectively. These are \n rebate schemes funded by the  Plastic Bag Tax Scheme, aimed at  encouraging NUS students and  staff to bring their own lunch  boxes and tumblers \n for takeaways.  \nNUS Students Against Violation of the \n Earth (SAVE) is the main environmental  student group in the University. The group  initiates campaigns and projects to reduce  waste and promote nature appreciation,  including Green Bazaar, Plastic Bag Tax  Scheme, Projects Box and Tumbler, \n and Reusable Bag Library. \nThe image shows an icon of a plastic bag with the text \"10¢\" on it, set against an orange circle background. This likely indicates a charge of 10 cents for a plastic bag.\nPLASTIC BAG TAX SCHEME \nSince 2008, a 10-cent charge per  plastic bag has been imposed to  encourage consumers to switch  from using plastic bags to reusable  bags at canteens, convenience  stores and bookstores.\n The tax proceeds go to the \n NUS Sustainability Fund that  supports environmental projects  run by NUS students.  \nThe image shows an icon of a shopping bag with a recycling symbol on it, set against an orange circular background. This typically represents a focus on eco-friendly or recyclable products.\nREUSABLE BAG LIBRARY \nLaunched in 2018, \n the Reusable Bag Library provides  easily accessible alternatives  to plastic bags at retail outlets  on campus, such as Cheers  convenience store. \n Reusable bags are regularly \n refilled at the library racks  whenever possible. The NUS  community is encouraged to  borrow, return and contribute  additional bags at the \n collection points. "}
