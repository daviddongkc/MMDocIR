Just   $40\\%$   said they were satisfied with  the candidates in the race.          \nAmong those who voted for Trump,  $65\\%$   said  they were satisfied with the field of candidates,  which marks a low point for voters who backed  the winning candidate in any recent election.  Eight years ago,  $95\\%$   of Obama supporters  said they were satisfied with their vote choices,  and  $87\\%$   of Obama voters did so in 2012.   \nSupporters of losing presidential contenders  consistently express less positive views of the  field after elections, but Clinton voters are  particularly dissatisfied. Only  $25\\%$   express  satisfaction with their options for president  this year.
