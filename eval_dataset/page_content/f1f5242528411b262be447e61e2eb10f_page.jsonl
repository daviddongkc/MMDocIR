Deﬁnition \nPath o genetics encompasses studying the various factors and different mechanisms involved in the pathogen es is of genetic diseases. It comprises the study of mutagens or factors that can cause change and/or damage of the genetic material, the study of mutations or acquired structural/functional changes of the genetic components at any of its organizational levels that result secondary to the effects of mutagens, the study of the various anti-mutation mechanisms of the human genome/ transcript ome/proteome that exert an essential and pivotal role in maintaining the integrity/stability/identity of the genome, the study of the different and varying path o physiological alterations in cellular functions secondary to the ensuing disturbances of the metabolic-regulatory networks that mediate and control these functions, and the study of the different path o genetic mechanisms that mediate the development and pathogen es is of genetic defects due to the ensuing changes of the normal structure/function framework of the genetic material. \n2. Pathogen es is of genetic diseases \nGenetic diseases are caused by harmful mutations. Mutations cause structural changes and consequent functional alterations of the affected components of the genetic material, leading ultimately to a deﬁcient synthesis of proteins or synthesis of defective proteins necessary for mediation of cellular activities. These functional consequences are reﬂected in disturbed/defec- tive construction of one or more of the metabolic networks that regulate every aspect of cellular functions. As depicted from the cardinal dogma of molecular biology, mutated genome results in the transcription of altered transcript ome which, in turn, causes synthesis of a defective proteome. The defective proteome leads to wide spread path o physiological alterations that pave the way for the development of various path o genetic mechanisms responsible for initiation and pathogen es is of genetic disorders. The spectrum of path o physiological alterations and patho- genetic mechanisms is quite wide and is steadily expanding as more knowledge of the structure/function/behavior/regulation of the genetic material is revealed. However, the basic e tio logical outline of development of genetic defects, as depicted in  Fig. 1 , can be summarized as follows ( Fig. 1 ): \n\n(1) Deletion or loss of part of a gene, one or many genes, part of a chromosome, one or more chromosomes, one or more of mitochondrial genes, or even a whole genome. (2) Duplication/rearrangement of the genetic material. (3) Deﬁcient/defective transcription of mRNA. (4) Deﬁcient/defective post-transcriptional modi cations of mRNA. "}

The specific pathognomonic\nphenotype that characterizes each genetic disease is primarily\ndetermined by the spectrum of pathophysiological changes in\naffected subjects. These, in turn, are determined by the spec-\ntrum of the mutation-induced damage to the genetic material\nin affected patients.\n\n3. Mutagens\n\nMutagens are factors capable of affecting the structural integ-\nrity of the genome. The number of harmful mutagens we are\ncontinually exposed to, and interacting with, in our life, start-\ning with fertilization and ending by death, is innumerable.\nHowever, due to the many lines of defense against the harmful\neffects of these factors, represented by the many anti-mutation\nmechanisms of the genome and proteome, only a small per-\ncentage of mutational events can reach a threshold level\nbeyond which genetic defects can develop.\n\n4. Classification of mutagens\n\n(A) According to their nature, mutagens are classified into\nthree main categories:\n\n(1) Chemical mutagens: these compounds are\ninnumerable in the environment and include, for\nexample, organic compounds, asbestos, insecticides,\nherbicides, heavy metals, etc.\n\nPathogenesis of genetic diseases.\n\n(2) _ Physical mutagens: these include particulate radi-\nations like X ray, alpha particles, UV waves at\n2800 A wavelength, solar radiation, thermal and\nmechanical agitation of nucleic acids [1].\n\n(3) Biological mutagens: these include living microor-\nganisms like some viruses: cytomegalovirus, rub-\nella virus and herpes virus.\n\n(B) According to their pathogenetic effects, mutagens are\n\nclassified into four main categories:\n\n(1) Non-specific Mutagens.\n\n(2) Carcinogens are mutagens that induce malignant\ntransformations in affected cells.\n\n(3) Clastogens are mutagenic agents that can induce\nchromosome breaks in affected cells.\n\n(4)  Teratogens are mutagens that cause congenital\nmalformations in exposed fetuses. (Fig. 2)\n\nThe pathogenetic effects of mutagens and the resulting\npathological alterations follow disturbed functions of mutated\ngenes. Many types of mutagens have the ability to induce all\ntypes of mutagenic damage to the cell. Particulate and non-\nparticulate radiations, for example, are effective carcinogens\ncapable of causing malignant transformation of affected cells.\nThey can also cause chromosomal gaps and breaks. In\naddition, teratogenic effects in developing fetuses following\nexposure of pregnant women to radiation are a well-known\nhazard of overexposure to radiation during pregnancy. This\nglobal mutagenic effect is also shared by many other types of\nmutagens like mutagenic viruses and chemicals that can induce\nmalignant transformation, chromosomal breaks and terato-\ngenic malformations in exposed subjects.\n\n5. Factors affecting actions of mutagens\n\nThe pathological effects of mutagens are determined by many\ndifferent factors. Each of these factors has its relative muta-\ngenic potential depending on the circumstances of its action.\nCongenital malformations caused by teratogens, for instance,\ndepend largely on timing of exposure of the developing\n", "vlm_text": "The image is a flowchart titled \"Pathogenetics ..

(7) Deﬁcient/defective synthesis of genetic regulatory components that include transcription nu cleo proteins, transcription factors, microRNA, etc. \nIrrespective of the site, type, nature or magnitude of the mutational event(s) that drastically affect the genetic material, the resultant alterations in gene function(s) trigger many dis- turbances in one or more of the cellular metabolic regulatory networks mediated by the deﬁcient/defective gene products, thus leading to a wide and varied spectrum of path oph y sio log- ical changes in cellular functions leading, ultimately, to the development of genetic diseases. The speciﬁc path o gnomon ic phenotype that characterizes each genetic disease is primarily determined by the spectrum of path o physiological changes in affected subjects. These, in turn, are determined by the spec- trum of the mutation-induced damage to the genetic material in affected patients. \n3. Mutagens \nMutagens are factors capable of affecting the structural integ- rity of the genome. The number of harmful mutagens we are continually exposed to, and interacting with, in our life, start- ing with fertilization and ending by death, is innumerable. However, due to the many lines of defense against the harmful effects of these factors, represented by the many anti-mutation mechanisms of the genome and proteome, only a small per- centage of mutational events can reach a threshold level beyond which genetic defects can develop. \n4. Class i cation of mutagens \n(A) According to their nature, mutagens are classiﬁed into three main categories: (1) Chemical mutagens: these compounds are innumerable in the environment and include, for example, organic compounds, asbestos, insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals, etc. \n(2) Physical mutagens: these include particulate radi- ations like X ray, alpha particles, UV waves at  $2800\\;\\mathring\\mathrm{A}$  ˚ wavelength, solar radiation, thermal and mechanical agitation of nucleic acids  [1] . (3) Biological mutagens: these include living microor- ganisms like some viruses: cytomegalovirus, rub- ella virus and herpes virus. \n(B) According to their path o genetic effects, mutagens are classiﬁed into four main categories: (1) Non-speciﬁc Mutagens. (2) Carcinogens are mutagens that induce malignant transformations in affected cells. (3) Clastogens are mutagenic agents that can induce chromosome breaks in affected cells. (4) Teratogens are mutagens that cause congenital malformations in exposed fetuses. ( Fig. 2 ) \nThe path o genetic effects of mutagens and the resulting pathological alterations follow disturbed functions of mutated genes. Many types of mutagens have the ability to induce all types of mutagenic damage to the cell. Particulate and non- particulate radiations, for example, are effective carcinogens capable of causing malignant transformation of affected cells. They can also cause chromosomal gaps and breaks. In addition, teratogen ic effects in developing fetuses following exposure of pregnant women to radiation are a well-known hazard of overexposure to radiation during pregnancy. This global mutagenic effect is also shared by many other types of mutagens like mutagenic viruses and chemicals that can induce malignant transformation, chromosomal breaks and terato- genic malformations in exposed subjects. \n5. Factors affecting actions of mutagens \nThe pathological effects of mutagens are determined by many different factors. Each of these factors has its relative muta- genic potential depending on the circumstances of its action. Congenital malformations caused by teratogens, for instance, depend largely on timing of exposure of the developing "}

Induced and spontaneous mutation\n\nInduced mutations are structural alterations of the genetic\nmaterial that occur due to exposure to the effects of any of\nthe known mutagens. Spontaneous mutations, on the other\nhand, are mutations that occur without recognizable causes.\nSpontaneous mutations happen, probably, on a regular basis\nbecause of the intrinsic nature of the genome. Possible poten-\ntial causes of spontaneous mutation of the genome can be\ndelineated and include: transposon activity, tautomerism an\nchanges of energy states of hydrogen bonds of bases.\nTransposon activity represents a major potential cause of\nspontaneous mutations [2]. The movement of transposons\nresults in insertional mutagenesis and disruption of targete\ngenes or other functional genetic elements. Disturbed gene\nfunction with resultant deficiency of gene product, production\nof defective protein/RNA or loss of genetic regulatory mecha-\nnisms exerted by mutated genes follows transposon-induce\nmutations. Tautomerism of bases of the DNA also accounts\nfor a considerable fraction of spontaneous mutations of the\ngenetic material. Changes of energy states of hydrogen bonds\nbetween complementary bases of DNA represent a_ thir\npotential cause of spontaneous mutation. Alterations resulting\nfrom changes in electron resonance and/or proton transfer or\nrelocation between the bonds can lead to tautomeric shift or\ntautomerization and momentary change of one base to\nanother base, thus inducing point mutation, transition muta-\ntion [1]. The actual mechanisms underlying the occurrence of\nthese changes are still largely undefined, precisely. Analysis\nof DNA base dynamics according to quantum, rather than\nto Newtonian, principles seems essential for clarifying these\nmechanisms, and the concept of quantum biology, or studying\nthe structure and function of the genetic material based on\nprinciples and rules of quantum mechanics, would certainly\nprevail due to the progressive increase in our knowledge of\nthe structure and function(s) of our genome and our proteome.\nReplicative errors occurring during cell division and repli-\ncation of the DNA are, arbitrarily, considered as one source\nof spontaneous mutations. These errors occur, and persist,\nJue to many causes including failure of the proof reading sys-\ntem of DNA replication or failure of the DNA repair system to\nrepair or correct the errors. It is estimated that during every\nsomatic cell division cycle of nearly 20h duration, about\n12,000 point mutations occur along the whole genome. The\nvast majority of these replicative errors are repaired by the\nDNA repair system of the cell. If some of these errors escape\ndetection and repair they will persist and be transferred to\nthe genome of daughter cells and become fixed mutations.\n\n7.2. Nuclear and mitochondrial mutation\n\nNuclear mutations are mutations that affect the nuclear gen-\nome, and mitochondrial mutations are mutations that affect\nthe mitochondrial genome. Mutations of nuclear genes\naccount for the occurrence of most genetic diseases. Due to\nthe marked differences between the specific structural organi-\nzation of each genome, each type of these mutations has its\nown characteristic features. Nuclear mutations may affect\none or both alleles of a structural gene on an autosome or\non a sex chromosome, thus giving rise to any of the traditional\ngenetic disorders: autosomal and sex linked dominant and\n\nrecessive diseases. The presence of most nuclear genes as pairs\nof alleles derived equally from both parents, paternal and\nmaternal alleles, allows for this classification of genetic dis-\neases due to nuclear gene mutations to be formulated clearly.\nMitochondrial mutations, on the other hand, have different\nfeatures due to the peculiar nature of the mtDNA. Each\nmtDNA molecule consists of 37 genes and exists inside the\nmitochondrion in large numbers, tens to thousands, depending\non the metabolic activities of the cell and its demand for ATP.\nThus, the copy number of each mtDNA molecule, and of\nmitochondrial genes is extremely huge in metabolically active\norgans, e.g. brain, retina, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal\nmuscles. Mutations of mitochondrial genome can affect a\nconsiderable portion of its genes without affecting its efficiency\nin mediating its functions. It is estimated that mitochondrial\nysfunction begins to occur when approximately 80% of its\ngenome gets mutated. This threshold effect does not apply\nfor nuclear mutations where mutation of one single allele\ncan cause a serious disease, as is the case for many autosomal\nominant disorders.\n\nMitochondria in somatic cells are derived from maternal\nmitochondria in the ovum. The sperm, with rare exceptions,\noes not offer any mitochondrial genes to the zygote, because\nsperm mitochondria are present in the neck piece of the sperm,\nwhich exists next to its head pro-nucleus and which do not par-\nticipate in fertilization. Accordingly, mitochondrial disorders\nresult from mutations of maternal mitochondria and are trans-\nmitted by carrier or affected mothers to all their offspring. This\nifference underlies the specific features that characterize the\nnature and the inheritance pattern of mitochondrial diseases.\n\n7.3. Somatic and germinal mutation\n\nSomatic mutations refer to mutations of the genome of\nsomatic cells. Since somatic cells do not participate in fertiliza-\ntion or determination of the genetic constitution of the off-\nspring they can’t be transmitted to the offspring, i.e. they are\nnot heritable mutations. They can be transmitted only to the\ndaughter cells of mutated cells upon their division. The effects\nof somatic mutations depend on many factors including the\ntype of cell, the genetic constitution of affected cells, selective\ntargeting of nuclear and/or mitochondrial genome and the\nmutation burden of the cell. According to the interactive pro-\ncesses involving these factors, somatic mutations might result\nin cell death if the mutation-induced pathophysiological alter-\nations of the cell exceed its ability to obviate and correct these\nalterations. Milder alterations can cause deranged cellular\nfunction(s) and limited or progressive failure and loss of cellu-\nlar activities, e.g. progressive organ failure syndrome following\noverexposure to radiation. Somatic mutations affecting the\nproto-oncogenes or genes regulating DNA repair systems\ncan result in malignant transformation of the cell and develop-\nment of cancer.\n\nSomatic cells overburdened with mutation are driven to a\nspecial suicidal pathway involving its involuntary death to\nprotect other cells from the hazardous risk of its malignant\ntransformation. It might also be looked at as a cellular\neconomic adaptation behavior by getting rid of mutated\ndiseased, energy consuming and harmful cells. This mechanism\nof compulsory involuntary or programed cell death, referred to\nas apoptosis, represents an important protective anti-mutation\n\n", "vlm_text": "7.1.

Possible poten- tial causes of spontaneous mutation of the genome can be delineated and include: transposon activity, taut omer is m and changes of energy states of hydrogen bonds of bases.

The vast majority of these replica ti ve errors are repaired by the DNA repair system of the cell. If some of these errors escape detection and repair they will persist and be transferred to the genome of daughter cells and become ﬁxed mutations. \n7.2.

Thus, the copy number of each mtDNA molecule, and of mitochondrial genes is extremely huge in metabolically active organs, e.g. brain, retina, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal muscles. Mutations of mitochondrial genome can affect a considerable portion of its genes without affecting its efﬁciency in mediating its functions. It is estimated that mitochondrial dysfunction begins to occur when approximately   $80\\%$   of its genome gets mutated. This threshold effect does not apply for nuclear mutations where mutation of one single allele can cause a serious disease, as is the case for many autosomal dominant disorders. \n\nMitochondria in somatic cells are derived from maternal mitochondria in the ovum. The sperm, with rare exceptions, does not offer any mitochondrial genes to the zygote, because sperm mitochondria are present in the neck piece of the sperm, which exists next to its head pro-nucleus and which do not par- ticipate in fertilization.

If the particular ovum or sperm affected by the\nmutation happens to participate in fertilization and zygote for-\nmation, the mutation will be inherited and transferred to all\ncells the offspring and a carrier or disease state might result\naccording to the nature of the mutated gene and the pattern\nof its inheritance.\n\n7.4. Static and dynamic mutation\n\nStatic mutations signify mutations that are transmitted with-\nout change in type or extent of the mutation from a parent\nto his progeny. For instance, a father suffering from Marfan\nsyndrome due to a specific mutation in the fibrillin gene may\ntransfer the mutation as it is to some of his offspring.\nMutation analysis by molecular diagnostic techniques of the\ngene of both father and child will reveal identity of the muta-\ntion between them in the affected gene. Static mutations char-\nacterize the mutational events that underlie the development of\nmost currently defined genetic diseases.\n\nDynamic mutations, on the other hand, represent a peculiar\ncategory of genetic mutations that increase in magnitude or\nextent upon transmission from a carrier parent to an offspring.\nThe discovery of this type of mutation clarified the patho-\ngenetic mechanisms responsible for the pathogenesis of a large\nnumber of genetic diseases known as triplet repeat expansion\ndisorders. The list of these diseases due to this type of mutation\nis expanding progressively and includes many common and\nrelevant genetic disorders like fragile X syndrome, Friedreich\nataxia, Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, some types\nof spino-cerebellar ataxia and many others.\n\nIn this type of mutation, a normal defined number of\ncodons, triplets of nucleotides, along a specific segment of\nthe gene increases in number when the gene is inherited. A\nthreshold effect characterizes this dynamic mutational process.\nWithin a certain range, we can identify a normal repeat num-\nber in the normal gene, a larger repeat number in carriers or\npre-mutation state and a much larger number in affected\npatients. For instance, the fragile X mental retardation gene\n(FMRI gene) which is mutated in fragile X syndrome, regu-\nlates the synthesis of a protein, fragile X mental retardation\nprotein (FMRP) which acts, partly, as RNA binding protein\nthat regulates in a global fashion cellular protein translation\nand micoRNA regulatory pathways, and has important func-\ntions in many organs like the nervous system and the ovaries.\nThe normal transcript of the gene has a sequence consisting of\nsix to forty-five (6-45) repeats of CGG nucleotides at the 5’-\nuntranslated region. Carrier mothers have a larger number\nof these repeats ranging from 55-200 repeats. When this per-\nmutation state of the gene is transmitted to a male offspring,\nprogressive increase, or dynamic expansion of the number of\nthe repeats happens and the gene in the affected male off-\nspring, or full mutation state, is found to contain more than\n200, sometimes much more numbers up to hundreds, of these\n\nDynamic Mutations\nFragile X Mental Retardation\n\n(1) Ettrect of (CGE) repeat number\n\nFigure 3.

The deleterious effects of this mutation and the result-\ning pathological phenotypes of the disease are due to disrup-\ntion of functions of the FMRI gene via silencing of the gene\nactivity and cessation of synthesis of the FMRP, or through\ndisrupting the structure of the gene leading to production of\na defective protein that can’t mediate its global cellular physi-\nological regulatory functions in post-translation modifications\nand targeting of synthesized proteins (Fig. 3).\n\n7.5. Pathological and non-pathological mutation\n\nThe deleterious effects of mutation are determined by many\nfactors. Mutations affecting functional elements of the gen-\nome, i.e. functional genes, can result in gene dysfunction caus-\ning deficient synthesis of the gene product or synthesis of\ndefective product. These mutations are expected to cause\npathophysiological changes and disease phenotypes in affected\nindividuals, and represent an overt example of harmful patho-\nlogical disease causing mutations. On the other hand, muta-\ntions affecting non-functional regions of the genome, e.g.\nintergenic areas of DNA and intronic segments of genes, do\nnot result in pathophysiological alterations and are referred\nto as non-pathological mutations.\n\nThough the vast majority of mutational events of the gen-\nome are harmful, some mutations, conversely, have beneficial\neffects. Such mutations, known as beneficial mutations, exert\ntheir effects by conferring selective advantage on affected cells\nsecondary to the resulting change of the structure and function\nof protein/enzyme product of the mutated gene. The most\nobvious example of beneficial mutations is the sickle mutation\nof the B-globin gene. Carriers, but not homozygotes, of this\nmutation have a selective value because they are more resistant\nto infestation by the malaria parasite compared to normal\nsubjects. Another example of beneficial mutations is the dele-\ntion mutation of the human CCRS5 or CD195 or chemokine\nreceptor type 5. The protein of the normal gene acts as a T cell\nmembrane receptor and is used by human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) as a gate to enter the cell and build up infection\nwith the virus. Mutation of the CCR5 gene, CCRS Delta32\ndeletion, results in the synthesis of an altered protein that loses\nits receptor function and can’t bind the HIV. Carriers of this\nbeneficial mutation are resistant to infection and genetic\nhomozygosity of the mutation is known to confer protection\nagainst infection with the virus [3].\n\n7.6.

The discovery of this type of mutation clariﬁed the patho- genetic mechanisms responsible for the pathogen es is of a large number of genetic diseases known as triplet repeat expansion disorders. The list of these diseases due to this type of mutation is expanding progressively and includes many common and relevant genetic disorders like fragile  $\\mathrm{X}$   syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, myotonic dystrophy, some types of spino-cerebellar ataxia and many others. \nIn this type of mutation, a normal deﬁned number of codons, triplets of nucleotides, along a speciﬁc segment of the gene increases in number when the gene is inherited. A threshold effect characterizes this dynamic mutational process. Within a certain range, we can identify a normal repeat num- ber in the normal gene, a larger repeat number in carriers or pre-mutation state and a much larger number in affected patients. For instance, the fragile X mental retardation gene (FMR1 gene) which is mutated in fragile X syndrome, regu- lates the synthesis of a protein, fragile   $\\mathrm{X}$   mental retardation protein (FMRP) which acts, partly, as RNA binding protein that regulates in a global fashion cellular protein translation and micoRNA regulatory pathways, and has important func- tions in many organs like the nervous system and the ovaries. The normal transcript of the gene has a sequence consisting of six to forty-ﬁve (6–45) repeats of CGG nucleotides at the   $5^{\\prime}.$  - untranslated region. Carrier mothers have a larger number of these repeats ranging from 55–200 repeats. When this per- mutation state of the gene is transmitted to a male offspring, progressive increase, or dynamic expansion of the number of the repeats happens and the gene in the affected male off- spring, or full mutation state, is found to contain more than 200, sometimes much more numbers up to hundreds, of these \nThe image illustrates the concept of triplet repeat expansion in fragile X syndrome. It shows the effect of the number of CGG repeats on different types of alleles:\n\n1. **Wild-type alleles:** Fewer than 50 CGG repeats.\n2. **Premutation alleles:** Between 50 and 200 CGG repeats.\n3. **Disease-causing alleles:** More than 200 CGG repeats.\n\nThese expansions in the CGG repeat region are associated with the development of fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition that causes various developmental issues.\nrepeats. The deleterious effects of this mutation and the result- ing pathological phenotypes of the disease are due to disrup- tion of functions of the FMR1 gene via silencing of the gene activity and cessation of synthesis of the FMRP, or through disrupting the structure of the gene leading to production of a defective protein that can’t mediate its global cellular physi- ological regulatory functions in post-translation modi cations and targeting of synthesized proteins ( Fig. 3 ). \n7.5. Pathological and non-pathological mutation \nThe deleterious effects of mutation are determined by many factors. Mutations affecting functional elements of the gen- ome, i.e. functional genes, can result in gene dysfunction caus- ing deﬁcient synthesis of the gene product or synthesis of defective product. These mutations are expected to cause path o physiological changes and disease phenotypes in affected individuals, and represent an overt example of harmful patho- logical disease causing mutations. On the other hand, muta- tions affecting non-functional regions of the genome, e.g. intergenic areas of DNA and intronic segments of genes, do not result in path o physiological alterations and are referred to as non-pathological mutations. \nThough the vast majority of mutational events of the gen- ome are harmful, some mutations, conversely, have beneﬁcial effects. Such mutations, known as beneﬁcial mutations, exert their effects by conferring selective advantage on affected cells secondary to the resulting change of the structure and function of protein/enzyme product of the mutated gene. The most obvious example of beneﬁcial mutations is the sickle mutation of the    $\\upbeta$  -globin gene. Carriers, but not homozygotes, of this mutation have a selective value because they are more resistant to infestation by the malaria parasite compared to normal subjects. Another example of beneﬁcial mutations is the dele- tion mutation of the human CCR5 or CD195 or chemokine receptor type 5. The protein of the normal gene acts as a T cell membrane receptor and is used by human immuno de cie n cy virus (HIV) as a gate to enter the cell and build up infection with the virus. Mutation of the CCR5 gene, CCR5 Delta32 deletion, results in the synthesis of an altered protein that loses its receptor function and can’t bind the HIV. Carriers of this beneﬁcial mutation are resistant to infection and genetic homo zy gos it y of the mutation is known to confer protection against infection with the virus  [3] . \n7.6.

Molecular mechanisms of point mutation\n\nPoint mutations refer to mutational events that involve one\nsingle base of the gene irrespective of the size of the gene.\nLethal genetic diseases can be caused by single point muta-\ntions, even in very large genes. A well known example is\nDuchenne myopathy due to single point mutations of the dys-\ntrophin gene which is the largest human gene composed of 2.4\nmillion bases. Sickle cell anemia is another example of a drastic\ngenetic disease resulting from a single point mutation of the\nbeta globin gene. Point mutations account for nearly 70% of\ncurrently defined human single gene disorders.\n\nMolecular mechanisms of point mutation comprise a wide\nspectrum of alterations at the molecular level of the genetic\nmaterial (Fig. 4). These mechanisms include replacement of\none base (nucleotide) of the gene by another base, deletion,\nor loss, of one base of the gene and addition of one base to\nthe gene. Replacement of one base by another base may not\naffect the function of the gene or, on the other hand, can have\ndrastic effects on gene function according to the type and func-\ntional consequences of the change.\n\n7.6.2. Types of point mutations\n\nFive different types of point mutation can be delineated: same-\nsense, missense, non-sense, re-sense and frame shift point\nmutations.\n\n7.6.2.1. Same-sense mutation. Due to degeneracy of the genetic\ncode that allows for defining the same amino acid by different\ncodons, a point mutation might involve one base of a specific\ncodon changing it to another codon, that still defines the same\namino acid. For example, the amino acid leucine is defined or\ndictated by six different codons, TTA-TTG-CTT-CTC-CT\nA-CTG. Replacement of one base of some of these codons,\nTTA to TTG, CTT to CTC or CTA to CTG, by another base\ndoes not change the specified amino acid, leucine, in the syn-\nthesized protein, hence the term same-sense because the same\namino acid is dictated by the new codon and no change in\nthe synthesized protein results.\n\n7.6.2.2. Mis-sense mutation. Due to the rigid rules of the\ngenetic code, a change of one base of a codon might turn it\ninto another codon that defines a different amino acid in the\nsynthesized protein. If base replacement results in a new codon\nthat specifies a different amino acid, a mis-sense mutation\nresults. For instance, a point mutation of the codon (TTT)\nor (thymine-thymine-thymine) that defines phenylalanine\nmay change it to another codon (TCT) or (thymine-cyto\nsine-thymine) that defines serine. For protein translation sys-\ntem this change is considered as wrong code, hence the term\nmissense, since it dictates a different amino acid. The effects\nof mis-sense mutation depend on the role played by the origi-\nnal amino acid in protein functioning, e.g. protein stability and\naggregation. If it has important roles within fundamental\nstructural or functional domains of the protein that could\nnot be performed by the new different amino acid, then patho-\nphysiological alteration of the structure and/or function of the\nprotein are expected and the pathogenesis of a genetic defect\nmight ensue.\n\n7.6.2.3. Non-sense mutation. The sixty-four codons of the\ngenetic code include three codons that do not define or dictate\nany amino acids and are used by the gene to signal the end of\nthe protein synthesis process in order to form the proper pro-\ntein with the proper number of amino acids.

Due to the peculiar structural organization\nof the nuclear human genome, chromosomal abnormalities\ncan involve either the structure of the chromosome, structural\nchromosomal abnormalities or the number of the chromo-\nsomes, numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Mutations of\nchromosome structure might involve the autosomes, autosomal\nchromosomal abnormalities, of chromosomes 1-22, or sex\nchromosomal abnormalities involving the sex chromosomes\n(X and Y chromosomes).

Interstitial deletions involving\nthe centromeric region of the chromosome lead to formation\n\nof acentric chromosomes.

It may be unidirectional when a segment of\nthe chromosome is broken at both ends, detached from its\noriginal site and translocated to another chromosome, or it\nmay be reciprocal when two different chromosomes inter-\nchange parts of their genetic material. Translocation can result\nin functional deficiency and development of genetic disease if\nthe translocated chromosome segments are inserted within\nintact gene sequences on the recipient chromosome leading\nto its disruption. Conversely, translocation might lead to over\nexpression of the genes at the end of the translocated segment\nif they get inserted next to an over expressive promoter of a\nrecipient gene. Translocations leading to over activation of\noncogenes or causing disruption of critical regulatory genes,\nor genes responsible for maintaining genomic stability and\nintegrity, are known to underlie the development of many\nmalignant tumors secondary to these peculiar pathogenetic\nmechanisms. Examples of such cancers include Burkitt lym-\nphoma (8;14), follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland\n1(2;3), Ewing sarcoma ¢(11;22), chronic myelogenous leukemia\n1(9;22), follicular lymphoma ¢(14;18) and many others.\n\nRobertsonian translocation is a specific type of transloca-\ntion involving translocation of a small (21-22) or large\n(13-15) acrocentric chromosome to another, large or small\nacrocentric chromosome. This defect involves fusion of the\nlong arms of the two acrocentric chromosomes at their\ncentromeres and loss of both short arms of the two chromo-\nsomes. Balanced carriers of this defect are phenotypically\nnormal because they do not suffer relevant genetic deletions,\nsince the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes do not code\nfor essential or unique gene products.\n\nRobertsonian translocations have an incidence of about\none in a thousand newborns with its most frequent forms being\nbetween chromosomes 13 and 14, 14 and 21, and 14 and 15.\nMost people with Robertsonian translocations have only 45\nchromosomes in each of their cells. Their children, however,\nmight inherit the fusion chromosome and become phenotypi-\ncally normal balanced carriers like their carrier parent or they\nmay inherit a missing or an extra long arm of an acrocentric\nchromosome. In unbalanced forms, Robertsonian transloca-\ntions cause chromosomal deletions or addition and result in\nchromosome trisomy syndromes including trisomy 13 (Patau\nsyndrome) and trisomy 21 (Down syndrome).

Gross mutations \nGross mutations are mutations that involve large portions of the genetic material. Chromosomal aberrations represent the prototype of this type of mutation, since even the smallest functional portion of a chromosome may consist of tens to hundreds of genes.

Interstitial deletions involving the centro m eric region of the chromosome lead to formation of acentric chromosomes. Because chromosome segregation during cell division depends on attachment of the spindle ﬁb- rils to speciﬁc centro m eric receptor proteins, acentric chromo- somes are lost during the anaphase stage of cell division and chromosome monosomy of affected daughter cell results. Autosomal monosomy is incompatible with life of the cell in view of the deleterious functional deﬁciency of the proteome due to loss of hundreds, even thousands, of genes located on the missing chromosome. \n\n(b) Translocation \nTranslocation involves breakage of part of the chromosome and its insertion within the genetic material of another chromosome. It may be unidirectional when a segment of the chromosome is broken at both ends, detached from its original site and trans located to another chromosome, or it may be reciprocal when two different chromosomes inter- change parts of their genetic material. Translocation can result in functional deﬁciency and development of genetic disease if the trans located chromosome segments are inserted within intact gene sequences on the recipient chromosome leading to its disruption. Conversely, translocation might lead to over expression of the genes at the end of the trans located segment if they get inserted next to an over expressive promoter of a recipient gene. Translocation s leading to over activation of oncogenes or causing disruption of critical regulatory genes, or genes responsible for maintaining genomic stability and integrity, are known to underlie the development of many malignant tumors secondary to these peculiar path o genetic mechanisms. Examples of such cancers include Burkitt lym- phoma  t (8;14), follicular carcinoma of the thyroid gland t (2;3), Ewing sarcoma  t (11;22), chronic my e loge nous leukemia t (9;22), follicular lymphoma  t (14;18) and many others. \nRobertson ian translocation is a speciﬁc type of transloca- tion involving translocation of a small (21–22) or large (13–15) a cro centric chromosome to another, large or small a cro centric chromosome. This defect involves fusion of the long arms of the two a cro centric chromosomes at their centromeres and loss of both short arms of the two chromo- somes. Balanced carriers of this defect are phenotypic ally normal because they do not suffer relevant genetic deletions, since the short arms of a cro centric chromosomes do not code for essential or unique gene products. \nRobertson ian translocation s have an incidence of about one in a thousand newborns with its most frequent forms being between chromosomes 13 and 14, 14 and 21, and 14 and 15.

However, if the break\npoints of the inversion disrupt the sequence of an important\ngene, disease state might ensue. Inversions result in disturbed\ncrossing over during meiosis and production of defective\ngametes with low recombination frequency.

The net loss of genetic material from the\nchromosome depends on the extent of deletion of both arms.\nRing chromosome formation can also occur with terminal or\ntotal deletion of one chromosome arm only, and in rare cases\nit occurs when telomeres at the ends of a chromosome fuse\nwithout any loss of genetic material from the chromosome.\nPathological consequences of ring chromosomes are caused\nby deletion of genes in the telomeric regions of affected\nchromosomes.\n\n(e) Duplication\n\nChromosome duplication occurs when part of a chromo-\nsome is copied abnormally, resulting in extra genetic material\nfrom the duplicated segment. Duplications arise from aberrant\nrecombination or unequal crossing-over that occurs between\nmisaligned homologous chromosomes during meiosis with\nconsequent reciprocal deletion of the homologous chromo-\nsomes. Chromosome duplications offer the etiological basis\nof gene duplication and gene amplification. They also offer\nan explanation for the presence of multiple repetitive\nsequences along the DNA, since placement of the duplicated\nregions adjacent to the original sequence results in formation\nof tandem repeats along the DNA. Gene amplification due\nto duplication is a common phenomenon for many oncogenes\nbecause duplication and amplification of oncogenes results in\ntheir over expression with over production of oncoproteins\nthat confer the malignant phenotype on transformed cells.\nExamples of human cancers due to oncogene duplication\nand amplification include esophageal cancer, gastric cancer,\ncervical cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and\nneuroblastoma.\n\n><\n\n>\\<\n\nik\n\nisochromosome\n\n[TI\nfn ae\n\nIsochromosome formation.\n\nThe finding that specific genomic regulatory elements, e.g.\nzinc finger nuclease enzyme, can induce specific chromosomal\nrearrangements, like duplications and inversions, suggest an\nevolutionary role for these chromosomal abnormalities. This\nevent might be considered as a mechanism of genomic evolu-\ntion through formation of novel genes that can amplify the\nfunction of parent genes or, alternatively, can undergo one\nor successive mutational events converting them to new genes\nwith new functions. However, the beneficial role of this pre-\nsumed evolutionary pathway as identified in some organisms,\ne.g. the mutational conversion of a duplicated digestive gene\nin ice fish into an antifreeze gene [7] is still a matter of debate\nwaiting for clarification in human race since most of these\nchromosomal rearrangements have pathological effects on\naffected subjects. This might be attributed to their being an\nexpression of genomic instability, rather than of genomic evo-\nlution, of the human genome.\n\n(f) Isochromosomes\n\nNormally, duplicated chromosome pairs separate from\neach other and get equally distributed to daughter cells by\nthe attachment of the spindle fibrils to specific receptor pro-\nteins on their common centromere with consequent disjunction\nalong their longitudinal axis (Fig. 8). Abnormal attachment of\nthe spindle fibrils or instability of the centromeric region might\nresult in abnormal separation of the chromosome pair along\nits transverse axis so that two chromosomes result: one consist-\ning of the long arms of the pair and the other consisting of the\nshort arms only, i.e. mirror-image chromosomes. This results\nin complete deletion and functional monosomy of the short\narm or the long arm of each resulting isochromosome,\nrespectively. Isochromosomes have equal arms with identical\nbanding pattern of both arms. They are seen in some female\npatients with Turner syndrome and in many types of myeloid\nand lymphoblastic leukemias. They may rarely involve\nautosomes, e.g. isochromosome 18q syndrome.\n\n(g) Mosaicism\n\nChromosomal mosaicism describes the presence of two or\nmore cell populations with different chromosome comple-\nments in one individual. For instance, mosaic Down syndrome\n(46,XY/47,XY, +21), mosaic Turner syndrome (46,XX/45,X)\nand mosaic Klinefelter syndrome (46,XY/47,XXY).\nNormally, due to Lyonization or X chromosome inactivation,\nall female cells are functionally mosaic as regards the X chro-\nmosome, i.e. cells with the maternal X inactivated depend on\nthe paternal X chromosome genes for mediating X\n\n", "vlm_text": "The image illustrates the formation of an isochromosome.

The net loss of genetic material from the chromosome depends on the extent of deletion of both arms. Ring chromosome formation can also occur with terminal or total deletion of one chromosome arm only, and in rare cases it occurs when telomeres at the ends of a chromosome fuse without any loss of genetic material from the chromosome. Pathological consequences of ring chromosomes are caused by deletion of genes in the telomeric regions of affected chromosomes. \n(e) Duplication \nChromosome duplication occurs when part of a chromo- some is copied abnormally, resulting in extra genetic material from the duplicated segment. Duplications arise from aberrant recombination or unequal crossing-over that occurs between misaligned homologous chromosomes during meiosis with consequent reciprocal deletion of the homologous chromo- somes. Chromosome duplications offer the e tio logical basis of gene duplication and gene amp li cation. They also offer an explanation for the presence of multiple repetitive sequences along the DNA, since placement of the duplicated regions adjacent to the original sequence results in formation of tandem repeats along the DNA. Gene amp li cation due to duplication is a common phenomenon for many oncogenes because duplication and amp li cation of oncogenes results in their over expression with over production of on co proteins that confer the malignant phenotype on transformed cells. Examples of human cancers due to oncogene duplication and amp li cation include esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and neuroblastoma. \nThe ﬁnding that speciﬁc genomic regulatory elements, e.g. zinc ﬁnger nuclease enzyme, can induce speciﬁc chromosomal rearrangements, like duplications and inversions, suggest an evolutionary role for these chromosomal abnormalities. This event might be considered as a mechanism of genomic evolu- tion through formation of novel genes that can amplify the function of parent genes or, alternatively, can undergo one or successive mutational events converting them to new genes with new functions. However, the beneﬁcial role of this pre- sumed evolutionary pathway as identiﬁed in some organisms, e.g. the mutational conversion of a duplicated digestive gene in ice ﬁsh into an antifreeze gene  [7]  is still a matter of debate waiting for clar i cation in human race since most of these chromosomal rearrangements have pathological effects on affected subjects.

For instance, mosaic Down syndrome  $(46,\\mathrm{XY}/47,\\mathrm{XY},+21)$  , mosaic Turner syndrome (46,XX/45,X) and mosaic Klinefelter syndrome (46,XY/47,XXY).

If a dupli- cated chromosome pair fails to separate from each other and both chromosomes are distributed to one daughter cell only, then trisomy of this cell results with concomitant monosomy of the other daughter cell. Partial trisomy refers to duplication of certain parts of a chromosome, e.g. the long arm or the short arm only. It has similar e tio logical bases like complete trisomy including non-disjunction, spindle derangement s and centro m eric breaks due to genomic instability. \n(b) Monosomy means the presence of one single copy of the chromosome. Autosomal monosomy is incompatible with nor- mal development and cells with this type of abnormalities die because of lack of the vital functions of hundreds or thousands of genes on the missing chromosome. Monosomy of the   $\\mathrm{X}$  chromosome is the only monosomy compatible with life in view of the peculiar nature of the genetics of the X chromosome. Partial monosomy, due to deletion of a part of a chromosome, is a common cyto genetic abnormality seen in many genetic syndromes.

In some cases it might be so extensive that some malignant cells have chromosome number reaching near haploidy, or 23 chro- mosomes. Hypo diploid y is an important prognostic marker for the karyotypic evolution of cancer cells since the smaller the number of chromosomes a cell can live with, the more vir- ulent malignant phenotype these cells can have. Milder states of hypo diploid y, low hypo diploid y with (33–38) chromosomes and high hypo diploid y with (42–45) are also common cytoge- netic ﬁndings in malignant cells. \n(d) Hyper diploid y, or chromosome numbers more than 46 chromosomes, underlies the pathogen es is of some genetic disorders, e.g. trisomy 13–18–21, XXY, XYY and multiple X syndromes with three or more X chromosomes in cells of affected female patients. Marked pathological hyper diploid y with chromosome number reaching up to seventy (70) or a lit- tle bit more chromosomes, however, is quite common in many malignancies like acute lymph oblast ic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia  [9] .

However, several kinds of\nmutations can affect the sugar and the phosphate group, and\ncan have deleterious effects on the genetic material. Several\nkinds of mutation can affect the sugar portion of the nucleo-\ntide. For instance, some physical and chemical mutagens can\nadd oxygen to the deoxyribose of DNA or remove oxygen\nfrom the ribose of RNA, or a whole deoxyribonucleotide\nmight be substituted by a ribonucleotide.

Irradiation turns ordinary phosphorus\nto radioactive phosphorus which, upon release of an electron,\nchanges to non-radioactive sulfur and suffers a recoil in diam-\neter leading to loss of its connection to the adjacent sugar. This\nresults in multiple recoil breaks in the sugar-phosphate\n\nbackbone of the DNA with ultimate breakage mutations of\nthe nucleic acid [1].\n\n7.8. Persistent and reversible mutation\n\nMutations are frequent structural genetic alterations in view of\nthe dynamic nature of the genome. It almost always accompa-\nnies replication of DNA and transcription of RNA. However,\nmost of these mutations are corrected and repaired by the\ngenomic repair mechanisms. Mutations in one cell that escape\nrepair are liable to be transferred to daughter cells upon\ndivision and a whole progeny of mutated cells makes its\nappearance. Persistence of the mutation and its transfer to\nprogeny cells results in fixation of the mutation, the change\nbecomes persistent and appears in all daughter cells. The\noutcome of this scenario depends on the type of the cell and\nthe pathogenetic effects of the resulting damage.

However, a parallel human genome function project aiming at deﬁning the complete functional spectrum of the genome seems to be an indispensable and imperative task in order to ﬁnalize our knowledge of our genetic material. \nCurrently deﬁned path o genetic mechanisms and patho- physiological alterations implicated in the pathogen es is of genetic disorders include the following: \n(1) Loss/damage/duplication/in activation of nuclear genes (2) Mutation of mitochondrial genes (mitDNA) (3) Deﬁcient/defective DNA replication/repair (4) Triplet repeat expansion disorders (5) Loss/acquisition/damage of chromosomes (6) Deﬁcient transcription of mRNA \n(7) Transcription of defective mRNA\n\n (8) Deﬁcient/defective post-transcription mRNA repair\n\n (9) Deﬁcient/defective post-transcription modi cations of mRNA\n\n (10) Deﬁcient translation of proteins\n\n (11) Translation of defective proteins\n\n (12) Deﬁcient/defective post-translation modi cation of proteins\n\n (13) Deﬁcient/defective post-translation repair of misfolded proteins\n\n (14) Deﬁcient/defective post-translation targeting and traf- ﬁcking of proteins\n\n (15) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cell growth\n\n (16) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cell division\n\n (17) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cell differentiation\n\n (18) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cell migration\n\n (19) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of inter cellular contact and cell movement\n\n (20) Deﬁcient/defective apoptosis/selection repair\n\n (21) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cell architecture and cytoskeleton: e.g. ciliary dyskinesia disorders (bronchi ect as is, dex tro car dia and situs-inversus, hydron ep hro s is, hydro c ep haly, male infertility and repeated abortions), hereditary sp hero cyto s is, Wiskott– Aldrich syndrome and neural tube defects.\n\n (22) Imprinting disorders: genomic imprinting disorders, e.g. ovarian teratomas and hy dati di form moles, and genic imprinting diseases, e.g. Prader–Willi syndrome, Angelman syndrome, Silver–Russell syndrome, Beckwith–Wiedemann Syndrome.\n\n (23) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of cellular functions:\n\n (a) Deﬁcient/defective transport across cell membrane or membranes of cell organelles (transport defects)\n\n (b) Deﬁcient/defective transport across cell pores, nuclear pores or pores of cell organelles (chanel lop athies)\n\n (c) Deﬁcient/defective secretion of gene products (pro- tein/enzyme deﬁciency disorders)\n\n (d) Deﬁcient/defective excretion of metabolic waste prod- ucts (storage disorders)\n\n (e) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of intra and inter net- work reactions and interactions: signal transduction disorders: e.g. neuro degeneration, diabetes mellitus, schizophrenia and Noonan syndrome.\n\n (f) Deﬁcient/defective positioning of structural proteins (cell cytoskeleton disorders)\n\n (g) Deﬁcient/defective regulation of intracellular trafﬁcking.\n\n (h) Deﬁcient/defective production of cellular energy: oxidative-phosphor yl ation disorders.\n\n (i) Ubiquitin ation/proteasome degradation defects: e.g. Friedreich ataxia, Huntington disease, Parkinson dis- ease, Alzheimer disease, Angelman syndrome, motor neuron disease and immuno de cie n cy.\n\n (j) Apoptosis defects: e.g. congenital malformations, autoimmune disorders, cancer and neuro degeneration. \n9. Anti-mutation mechanisms of the human genome and human proteome \nThe human genome develops, persists and works in a hostile environment full of existing, and continuously generated, mutagens. Mutational events induced by external factors, which include physical, chemical and biological mutagens, have widespread detrimental effects on the stability and integ- rity of the genome as well as on the stability and integrity of the proteome. Additionally, further and considerable damage of the structural organization and functional capabilities of both the genome and the proteome regularly occurs on contin- uous and progressive basis due to the continuously generated burden of internal mutagens that result from the diverse meta- bolic activities of the exceedingly large number of metabolic networks of the cell. Unless a powerful and effective protective and repair system actively participates in protecting the gen- ome and proteome of the cell against the deleterious effects of mutations, and in efﬁcient repair of resulting damage, main- taining the stability and integrity of both of these bio-systems that constitute the framework of life activities within the cell would have been impossible.

Anti-mutation mechanisms of the human genome \n10.1. Structural organization of the human genome \nThe peculiar structural organization of the human genome rep- resents the ﬁrst innate anti-mutation mechanism in view of the presence of large interspersed portions of non-functional intra- genic, introns, and inter-genic DNA sequences and segments that can be mutated without having appreciable deleterious functional effects. In addition to functional sequences needed for synthesis of protein and of regulatory small RNA species, the human genome has a considerable amount of repetitive DNA sequences, including both noncoding repetitive DNA sequences and multiple copy genes and gene fragments, a large number (19,000–21,000) of pseudo genes, a considerable sizable portion (about 1/6th of the total genome size) as pyknons, a quite large portion (nearly   $40\\%$   of the total genome size) as transposons and large numbers of multiple copies of functional genes that share the same regulatory function and whose sup- pression or damage by mutation can be tolerated by other genes having the same function. These peculiar structural features of the human genome allows for occurrence of mutational events in many segments of the genome without having appreciable functional defects. Even if some of these genes or DNA sequences have important roles in genome function, their pres- ence in multiple repetitive copies can greatly reduce, or even nullify, the consequences of mutational damage resulting from affecting many copies. \n\nThe presence of multiple copies, hundreds to thousands, of mitochondrial genes within the mitochondria of each cell is crucial in obviating devastating mutation-induced damage to these vital organelles in view of their role in production of ATP. This feature of mitochondrial genome allows for consid- erable burden of mutations to affect it before appreciable pathological consequences result. It is estimated that muta- tions affecting nearly   $80\\%$   of certain mitochondrial genes might occur before pathological manifestations of mitochon- drial genetic diseases make their appearance due to this multi- ple copy feature of mtDNA  [1] . \n10.2. Structural features of DNA \nDNA exists as a double stranded structure composed of two tightly bound strands, each strand consisting of a straight sugar-phosphate backbone with opposing nitrogenous bases linked by glycosidic linkage to the sugar of one strand and by hydrogen bonds with a complementary base on the other strand. This speciﬁc structural organization of DNA serves many purposes. It stabilizes the dynamics of the molecule, per- mits replication and duplication of the genetic material, pro- tects the interiorly located bases and, most important, stores a template or copy of the genetic information ready for use in case of damage of the other strand. If small or gross muta- tional events affect important functional portions of the genetic material, repair mechanisms can restore the exact sequence of the damaged or lost or deleted parts through restoration mechanisms based on the complementary informa- tion of the other strand. Mutations leading to damage of cor- responding segments of both strands represent a catastrophic event to the genome due to the absence of the sequence data- base needed for the repair mechanism to deﬁne the exact base sequence of the newly synthesized segment in place of the deleted or grossly damaged segment. \n10.3. Degeneracy of the genetic code \nDegeneracy of the genetic code represents the third innate anti- mutation mechanism of the human genome. This feature per- mits the occurrence of same-sense point mutations in func- tional codons without changing the amino acid deﬁned by the mutated codon. Since some amino acids, as a part of a speciﬁc protein domain, play critical roles in attaining and maintaining correct protein structure and in mediating proper protein function, point mutations leading to replacement of these essential amino acids by other amino acids, missense mutations, that can’t perform the functions of the original amino acids might result in detrimental effects on the struc- tural integrity and stability of the protein followed by deleteri- ous consequences on physiological function of the protein. Hence, degeneracy of the genetic code allows for occurrence of many point mutations, the commonest type of mutational events and the commonest cause of genetic disorders, without changing the ﬁnal structure of the synthesized protein, thus protecting against, and obviating, the pathological effects of these mutations.

They mediate this protective role by many\nmechanisms including modulation of charge transport of\noxidative agents within the DNA, limitation of DNA helix\ndistortion and regulation of protein-dependent alterations in\nDNA base stacking [1].\n\n10.6.

Genetic repair systems\n\nGenetic repair systems responsible for correcting and repairing\nmany different types of point and small mutations that affect\nthe genetic material, whether induced by exogenous mutagens\nor occurring secondary to endogenous spontaneous alter-\nations, comprise both nuclear DNA repair system and mito-\nchondrial DNA repair system. Genetic function and genetic\nrepair represent two sides of one coin. Without the persevering\ncontinuous, active and effective surveillance exerted by the\ngenetic repair systems to detect and repair the continuously\nand persistently occurring mutations, maintaining stability\nand integrity of the genome would be an impossible task.\nThese repair systems consist of large numbers of enzymes, pro-\nteins and related factors that function in complementary and\ncollaborative mechanisms along specific pathways, with each\nof them having a predefined role in the repair process. For\ninstance, if mutation causes damage of a genetic segment con-\nsisting of sequence of nucleotides, an endonuclease enzyme\ncuts both sides of the damaged segment, followed by addition\nof proper nucleotides instead of the damaged or deleted ones\nby a polymerase enzyme, then a ligase enzyme joins the ends\nof the newly added segment of nucleotides to the original\nneighboring nucleotides by forming phosphor-di-ester bonds\nbetween the phosphate and the sugar of adjacent nucleotides,\nthus, regaining the sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA [2].\n\n10.7.1.

These approaches include differ-\nent pathways and sub-pathways according to the type, site and\nextent of the mutation-induced damage and also according to\nthe stage of cell cycle affected by the mutation. They include:\nbase excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair\n(NER), direct reversal repair, mismatch repair, transcription-\ncoupled repair (TCR) and recombination repair (Fig. 11).\n\n10.7.1.1.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER). Nucleotide exci-\nsion repair is one of the most important DNA repair systems\nand is highly conserved among species, though it is much more\ncomplicated in higher eukaryotes than prokaryotes. The most\nprominent feature of this repair system is its broad substrate\nspecificity because it can excise DNA lesions such as UV-\ninduced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of\nDNA.\n\n10.7.1.3. Direct reversal repair. This repair mechanism can\ndirectly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and\nalkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl-\ntransferase proteins, respectively. Direct reversal repair mech-\nanisms are not followed by incision of DNA strands or\nresynthesis of new DNA since the changed or mutated bases\nare directly reverted to their original states either by light-\ndependent photoreactivation process, for pyrimidine dimers\nrepair, or by use of alkyltransferase. Placental mammals do\nnot have photolyase-dependent repair mechanisms and depend\non nucleotide excision repair to correct and repair UV-induced\npyrimidine dimer formation.\n\n10.7.1.4.. Mismatch repair (MMR). The mismatch repair\n(MMR) system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired\nbases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA\nreplication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of\nmany enzymes, proteins and signal discrimination factors, prob-\nably in collaboration with the proofreading system, to recognize\nthe mutated strand first and then to locate the site of the mis-\nmatched pair. This is followed by removal of the mutated\nsequence by an endonuclease, addition of new pair(s) by DNA\npolymerase and final regain of the DNA double stranded struc-\nture by DNA ligases. Post-replication mismatch repair is\nachieved by removal of a relatively long tract of mismatch-\ncontaining oligonucleotides, a process called long-patch MMR.\n\n10.7.1.5. Recombination repair. Recombination repair mecha-\nnisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of\nDNA which represent the most devastating mutation-\ninduced lesions of DNA because they can lead to loss of\ngenetic information and chromosomal instabilities with conse-\nquent pathological alterations including chromosome break-\nage syndromes and carcinogenesis. Double-strand breaks can\n\nDNA repair mechanisms.\n\nbe caused either endogenously during DNA replication due\nto replication errors, e.g. replication fork collapse, or exoge-\nnously by, e.g. ionizing radiation. Recombination repair mech-\nanisms consist of many various steps: end resection, strand\ninvasion, DNA repair synthesis, branch migration and\nHolliday junction resolution, and include, at least, two differ-\nent repair pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR)\nand nonhomologous end-joining repair. HR repair mechanism\nis the accurate pathway and makes use of undamaged homol-\nogous DNA as a template for repair. Non-homologous end-\njoining repair mechanism directly ligates two double-strand\nbreak ends together, and although it is efficient, it is prone\nto loss of genetic information at the ligation sites. However,\nthere are many anti-recombination mechanisms to suppress\nexcessive recombination that might lead to loss of genetic\ninformation and genomic instability [1].\n\n10.7.2. RNA repair/editing system\n\nRNA editing refers to molecular modifications of nucleotides of\nRNA through chemical changes in the base makeup of the\nmolecule. Such changes appear to be present in all three\ndomains of life, and involve both coding, mRNA, and non-\ncoding, tRNA and mRNA, types of small or microRNA.\nRNA editing occurs in the cell nucleus and the cytosol, as well\nas in mitochondria and is mediated by a complex repair system\ncomprising many species of small RNA (guide RNA) and large\nprotein complexes known as the editosomes. The pathways of\nRNA editing include many diverse processes: nucleoside base\nmodifications such as cytidine (C) to uridine (U) and adenosine\n(A) to inosine (I) deaminations, as well as non-templated inser-\ntions of nucleotide.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER).  Nucleotide exci- sion repair is one of the most important DNA repair systems and is highly conserved among species, though it is much more complicated in higher eukaryotes than prokaryotes. The most prominent feature of this repair system is its broad substrate speciﬁcity because it can excise DNA lesions such as UV- induced pyrimidine dimers as well as more bulky adducts of DNA. \n10.7.1.3. Direct reversal repair.  This repair mechanism can directly repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation and alkylation adducts by DNA photolyase enzymes and alkyl- transfer as e proteins, respectively. Direct reversal repair mech- anisms are not followed by incision of DNA strands or re synthesis of new DNA since the changed or mutated bases are directly reverted to their original states either by light- dependent photo reactivation process, for pyrimidine dimers repair, or by use of alkyl transfer as e. Placental mammals do not have photolyase-dependent repair mechanisms and depend on nucleotide excision repair to correct and repair UV-induced pyrimidine dimer formation.\n\n \n10.7.1.4. Mismatch repair (MMR).  The mismatch repair\n\n (MMR) system recognizes and corrects mismatched or unpaired bases that result from errors of DNA polymerase during DNA replication. It involves complex reactions and interactions of many enzymes, proteins and signal discrimination factors, prob- ably in collaboration with the proofreading system, to recognize the mutated strand ﬁrst and then to locate the site of the mis- matched pair. This is followed by removal of the mutated sequence by an end on ucl ease, addition of new pair(s) by DNA polymerase and ﬁnal regain of the DNA double stranded struc- ture by DNA ligases. Post-replication mismatch repair is achieved by removal of a relatively long tract of mismatch- containing oli go nucleotides, a process called long-patch MMR. \n10.7.1.5. Recombination repair.  Recombination repair mecha- nisms aim primarily at repairing double-strand breaks of DNA which represent the most devastating mutation- induced lesions of DNA because they can lead to loss of genetic information and chromosomal instabilities with conse- quent pathological alterations including chromosome break- age syndromes and carcinogen es is. Double-strand breaks can be caused either endogenous ly during DNA replication due to replication errors, e.g. replication fork collapse, or exoge- nously by, e.g. ionizing radiation. Recombination repair mech- anisms consist of many various steps: end resection, strand invasion, DNA repair synthesis, branch migration and Holliday junction resolution, and include, at least, two differ- ent repair pathways: homologous recombination repair (HR) and non homologous end-joining repair. HR repair mechanism is the accurate pathway and makes use of undamaged homol- ogous DNA as a template for repair. Non-homologous end- joining repair mechanism directly ligates two double-strand break ends together, and although it is efﬁcient, it is prone to loss of genetic information at the ligation sites. However, there are many anti-recombination mechanisms to suppress excessive recombination that might lead to loss of genetic information and genomic instability  [1] . \n\n10.7.2. RNA repair/editing system \nRNA editing refers to molecular modi cations of nucleotides of RNA through chemical changes in the base makeup of the molecule. Such changes appear to be present in all three domains of life, and involve both coding, mRNA, and non- coding, tRNA and mRNA, types of small or microRNA. RNA editing occurs in the cell nucleus and the cytosol, as well as in mitochondria and is mediated by a complex repair system comprising many species of small RNA (guide RNA) and large protein complexes known as the editosomes. The pathways of RNA editing include many diverse processes: nucleoside base modi cations such as cytidine (C) to uridine (U) and adenosine (A) to inosine (I) de ami nations, as well as non-templated inser- tions of nucleotide. RNA editing in mRNAs effectively alters the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein so that it differs from that predicted by the genomic DNA sequence. Though mRNA editing is used in many instances to allow for synthesis by the cell of more than one protein from the same mRNA tran- script, e.g. synthesis of both apo lipoprotein B-100 and apo lipoprotein B-48 from the same mRNA in liver cells, it can also be used to repair missense or termination mutations of the molecule which can have deleterious effects on the synthe- sized protein. Speciﬁc end on uc leases and ligases for double stranded species of RNA have been deﬁned in many prokary- otes and it might be just a matter of time before deﬁning their functional counterparts in eukaryotes and human cells.
