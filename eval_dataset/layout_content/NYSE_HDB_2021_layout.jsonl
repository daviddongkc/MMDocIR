The farmer accounts are electronically credited  and they can withdraw the money from cash  dispensers immediately, if needed. There  are two objectives behind the initiative.

Here’s a breakdown of the columns and possible interpretation of the table:\n\n1. **Annual Data**: Each column corresponds to a fiscal year, ranging from 2015-2016 to 2020-2021. The numbers represent some form of financial metrics, likely revenue, expenses, or other financial statements.\n\n2. **Data Categories**: \n   - The first section of numbers (e.g., 60,221.45, 69,305.96) likely represents the main category or headline figures for each fiscal year.\n   - Subcategories beneath them (slightly indented and in smaller font size) most likely represent detailed breakdowns or components contributing to the main figure.\n\n3. **Highlighted Figures**: Certain rows and figures are highlighted in bold which suggests the importance or key metrics for those specific years.\n\n4. **Growth Indicators/Percentages**: Towards the bottom of the table, there are percentages and decimal numbers (e.g., 24.42, 28.59, 17.97%). These might be financial ratios, growth rates, or other key performance indicators.\n\n5. **Asterisks**: The use of asterisks (e.g., ***) may denote data that is provisional, estimated, or not finalized.\n\nWithout a caption or additional context, it's difficult to be certain, but the layout and figures suggest that the table likely represents a financial summary or report over a period of time for a company or sector, providing important figures and possibly trends in performance."}

Thus, the stimulus package focused on the  survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-19 crisis  and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was  its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly  and to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing  the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them  by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a  fraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose  Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an  equity stake.
