We assess our engagement performance through an annual engagement survey that addresses engagement, direct supervisor effectiveness, behavior change and performance enablement, as well as through our voluntary turnover rate. \n $\\underline{{\\mathbf{D}+\\mathbf{I}}}$  We believe a diverse workforce and culture of inclusion is essential to drive innovation, fuel growth and help ensure our technologies and products effectively serve a global customer base.Danaher's Diversity  $^+$  Inclusion Council (including Danaher's Senior Vice President of Human Resources, Vice President of Diversity  $^+$  Inclusion and multiple other executive officers)oversees the development and execution of our diversity and inclusion  $\\bf(^{\\bullet}D^{+I^{\\bullet}})$  strategy. We focus on broadening our candidate pools, sourcing diverse slates in the hiring process and implementing and sustaining programs (such as our U.S.-based Associate Resource Groupsfor Women,Black,Latinx,LGBTQ and Asian descent associates)that offer mentorship support and engagement to help our associates, including those from underrepresented groups, succeed and thrive. In support of our  $\\mathrm{D+I}$  commitment, we conduct regular pay reviews from a race (in the United States.) and gender (globally) perspective that serve to proactively identify and address potential pay differences. As of December 31, 2020,  $36\\%$  of our total associates were female;  $29\\%$  of our managerial associates were female;  $33\\%$  of our total U.S. associates were People of Color; and  $25\\%$  of ourU.S. managerial associates were People of Color. \nRetention \nCompensation and Benefits. We are committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits, tailored in form and amount to geography, industry, experience and performance and designed to attract associates, motivate and reward performance, drive growth and support retention. We have a common job architecture across our businesses to provide a standardized framework for defining jobs, job families, and career levels, \nand set market-aligned pay structures for each career level (adjusted as appropriate for the particular job family, industry, and geography) based on a range of compensation surveys. Performance Management. Our Performance for Growth process supports our high-performance culture by seeking to ensure that high-performing associates are recognized and rewarded for their contributions. Talent Development and Career Mobility. Our talent development program (which is generally structured to consistof  $70\\%$  on-the-joblearning,  $20\\%$  coaching and mentoring and  $10\\%$  formal training)strives to provide every associate with appropriate development opportunities. In particular, we make available to people leaders at every level training, coaching and developmental resources to help them be effective leaders and advance their careers. We further encourage internal promotion and mobility through our Danaher Go program, which makes open positions throughout the organization visible to associates and proactively encourages our associates to seek promotional opportunities. We assess our performance in this area using metrics including internal fill rate (which tracks the percentages of open roles at particular levels filled by our own associates) as well as the percentage of eligible associates with talent assessments/career plans.

There is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare\nsystems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, in the United\nStates, in March 2010, the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education\nAffordability Reconciliation Act) (collectively, the “PPACA”) was signed into law, which substantially changed the way\nhealthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affected the healthcare industry. Since its\nenactment, there have been judicial, Congressional and executive challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and there may be\nadditional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future.\n\nMoreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for\ntheir marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed,\namong other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer\npatient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for medical products. Individual states in the\nUnited States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control product pricing, including\nprice or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and\ntransparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.\n\nData Privacy and Security Laws\n\nAs a global organization, we are subject to data privacy and security laws, regulations, and customer-imposed controls in\nnumerous jurisdictions as a result of having access to and processing confidential, personal and/or sensitive data in the course of\nour business. For example, in the United States, HIPAA privacy and security rules require certain of our operations to maintain\ncontrols to protect the availability and confidentiality of patient health information, individual states regulate data breach and\nsecurity requirements and multiple governmental bodies assert authority over aspects of the protection of personal privacy. In\nparticular, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which came into effect in January 2020 has some of the same\nfeatures as the GDPR (discussed below), and has already prompted several other states to consider enacting similar laws. The\nEU General Data Protection Regulation that became effective in May 2018 (“GDPR”) has imposed significantly stricter\nrequirements in how we collect, transmit, process and retain personal data, including, among other things, in certain\ncircumstances a requirement for almost immediate notice of data breaches to supervisory authorities with significant fines for\nnon-compliance.

The global spread of COVID-19 has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal\nactivities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and\ngovernments are taking to mitigate the spread. For example, many governments have issued “stay-at-home” orders which\nrestrict business and personal activities, and many employers are requiring employees to work from home. In addition to\nexisting travel and activity restrictions, jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further\nrestrict travel and other activities.

Our ability to\ncompete can also be impacted by changing customer preferences and requirements (for example increased demand for products\nincorporating digital capabilities or more environmentally-friendly products and supplier practices) as well as changes in the\nway healthcare services are delivered (including the movement of some care from acute to non-acute settings and increased\nfocus on chronic disease management).

These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party\nthat can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty. If we are required to indemnify any of the other parties\nunder the circumstances set forth in these agreements, we may be subject to substantial liabilities. In addition, with respect to\nthe liabilities for which the other parties have agreed to indemnify us under these agreements, there can be no assurance that the\nindemnity rights we have against such other parties will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of the liabilities, or\nthat such other parties will be able to fully satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. It is also possible that a court\ncould disregard the allocation of assets and liabilities agreed to between Danaher and such other parties and require Danaher to\nassume responsibility for obligations allocated to such other parties. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business\nand financial statements.\n\n22\n", "vlm_text": "as a result of our acquisitions and investments, we have recorded significant goodwill and other assets on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these assets, or if the value of our investments declines, we are required to incur impairment charges; we may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners or the companies we invest in, and we may not be able to direct or influence the management and operations of the joint venture, other strategic relationship or investee in the manner we believe is most appropriate, exposing us to additional risk; and investing in or making loans to early-stage companies often entails a high degree of risk, and we do not always achieve the strategic, technological, financial or commercial benefits we anticipate; we may lose our investment or fail to recoup our loan; or our investment may be illiquid for a greater-than-expected period of time. \nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities. \nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the acquired company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our business and financial statements. \nDivestitures or other dispositions could negatively impact our business,and contingent liabilities from businesses that we or our predecessors have disposed could adversely affect our business and financial statements. \nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest, spin-off, split-off or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example,  in 2015, Danaher separated and split-off to Danaher shareholders the majority of its former communications business in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Net Scout Systems,Inc.(the\"Communications Disposition'),in 2 O 16 Dana her separated and spun-off to Danaher shareholders its former Test & Measurement segment, Industrial Technologies segment (excluding the product identification businesses) and retail/commercial petroleum business (collectively known as Fortive Corporation) (the \"Fortive Disposition\"), and in 2019 Danaher consummated the separation and initial public offering (\"IPO\") and subsequent split-off of its Dental segment, known as Envista Holdings Corporation (the“Envista Disposition'). Transactions such as these pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business and financial statements. For example, when we decide to sell or otherwise dispose of a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms within our anticipated timeframe or at all, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell or dispose a business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not become satisfied. In addition, divestitures or other dispositions can dilute the Company's earnings per share, have other adverse financial, tax and accounting impacts and distract management, and disputes can arise with buyers. In addition, we have retained responsibility for and/or have agreed to indemnify buyers against some known and unknown contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses we or our predecessors have sold or disposed. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material effect on our business or financial statements but we cannot be certainthat this favorable pattern will continue. \nPotential indemnification liabilities pursuant to the Communications Disposition,the Fort ive Disposition or theEnvista Disposition couldmaterially and adversely affect our business and financial statements. \nWith respect to each of the Communications Disposition, the Fortive Disposition and the Envista Disposition, we entered into a separation agreement and related agreements to govern the separation and related transactions and the relationship between the respective companies going forward. These agreements provide for specific indemnity and liability obligations of each party that can lead to disputes between us and the respective counterparty.

Any sustained interruption in the supply of these items could adversely affect our business and financial statements.Inaddition,due to the highly competitive nature of the industries that we serve,thecost- containment efforts of our customers and the terms of certain contracts we are party to, when commodity prices rise we are not always able to pass along cost increases through higher prices.If we are unable to fully recover higher commodity costs through price increases or offset these increases through cost reductions, or if there is a time delay between the increase in costs and our ability to recover or offset these costs, our margins and profitability could decline and our business and financial statements could be adversely affected. \nOur restructuring actions canhavelong-term adverse effects on ourbusiness andfinancial statements. \nWe have implemented significant restructuring activities across our businesses to adjust our cost structure, and we may engage in similar restructuring activities in the future. These restructuring activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and can slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers, limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases and trigger adverse public attention. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize from such actions. Moreover, we may not succeed in implementing present or future restructuring activities or cost reduction activities. Realizing the anticipated benefits from these initiatives, if any benefits are achieved at all, can take several years, and we may be unable to achieve our targeted cost efficiencies and profit margin improvements. Additionally, we may have insufficient access to capital to fund investments in these strategic initiatives, or our business strategy may change from time to time, which could delay our ability to implement initiatives that we believe are important to our business.Any of the circumstances described above could adversely impact our business andfinancial statements.

In December\n2020, the UK and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that applies provisionally until it is ratified by the parties\nto the agreement. On December 31, 2020, the UK passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement, with\nthe EU expected to formally adopt the agreement in the first half of 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the\ngeneral objectives and framework of the relationship between the UK and the EU, including with respect to trade, transport,\nvisas, judicial matters, law enforcement and security matters, and provides for continued participation in community programs\nand mechanisms for dispute resolution. Uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation\nagreement and the other potential impacts of Brexit, such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the UK\ndetermines which EU laws to replace or replicate (including potentially new or different regulations affecting clearance or\napproval of products that are developed or manufactured in the UK), and trade and tax impacts as the UK negotiates its own tax\nand trade treaties with countries around the world.

One example is in the area of \\*base erosion and profit shifting,” for which the OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan that have been adopted and expanded by many taxing authorities to address perceived tax abuse and inconsistencies between tax jurisdictions. As a result, the tax laws in the United States and other countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely affect our business and financial statements \nLegal, political, and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom (\"UK\") from the EU could have an adverseeffect onourbusiness andfinancial statements. \nThe UK ceased to be a member state of the EU on January 31, 2020 (commonly referred to as “Brexit'), and the transition period provided for in the withdrawal agreement entered by the UK and the EU ended on December 31,2020.InDecember 2020, the UK and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement that applies provisionally until it is ratified by the parties to the agreement. On December 31, 2020, the UK passed legislation giving effect to the trade and cooperation agreement, with the EU expected to formally adopt the agreement in the first half of 2021. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the UK and the EU, including with respect to trade, transport, visas, judicial matters, law enforcement and security matters, and provides for continued participation in community programs and mechanisms for dispute resolution. Uncertainties remain regarding the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement and the other potential impacts of Brexit, such as the impact of new or different laws and regulations as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate (including potentially new or different regulations affecting clearance or approval of products that are developed or manufactured in the UK), and trade and tax impacts as the UK negotiates its own tax and trade treaties with countries around the world. The impacts from Brexit could add time and expense to the conduct of our business, delay regulatory approval of products, adversely impact the manufacturing or movement of products, adversely impact customer demand and otherwise adversely affect our business and financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had eight manufacturing facilities in the UK and the Company's net investment in property, plant and equipment in theUKwas  $\\S214$  million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, less than  $5\\%$  of our sales were derived from customers located in the UK, however, the impact of Brexit could also impact our business and financial statements outside the UK. \nOur defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect our financial statements. \nThe performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in discount rates can increase our funding obligations and adversely impact our financial statements. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing health care coverage to current employees and retirees can increase our future funding obligations and adversely affect our financial statements. \nLegal, Regulatory, Compliance and Reputational Risks \nSignificant developments or changes in U.s. laws or policies, including changes in U.S. trade policies and tariffs and the reaction of other countries thereto,particularly China,canhave an adverse effecton ourbusiness andfinancial statements \nSignificant developments or changes in U.S. laws and policies (including as a result of the new U.S. administration), such as laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where we or our customers operate, or governing the health care system and drug prices, can adversely affect our business and financial statements.

Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations also involves substantial costs. \nOur products are subject to clinical trials, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market,and could adversely affect our business and financial statements. \nAs a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for certain new products and new indications for certain existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials, or a regulator's or the market's perception of this clinical data, can adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business and financial statements. \nOff-label marketing of our products could result insubstantial penalties. \nThe FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about approved or cleared products. In particular, any clearances we may receive only permit us to market our products for the uses indicated on the labeling cleared by the FDA. We may request additional label indications for our current products, and the FDA may deny those requests outright, require additional expensive performance or clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared products as a condition of clearance. If the FDA or any other federal, state or foreign regulator determines that we have marketed our products for off-label use, we can be subject to exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the other adverse effects referenced under the risk factor titled “Certain of our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by the U.s. FDA and by comparable agencies of other countries, as well as laws regulating fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and the privacy and security of health information. Failure to comply with those regulations could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\" Any of these events could significantly harm our business and financial statements. \nCertain modifications to our products may require new 51o(k) clearances or other marketing authorizations and may require us to recall or cease marketing our products. \nOnce a medical device is permitted to be legally marketed in the United States pursuant to a 51o(k) clearance, a manufacturer may be required to notify the FDA of certain modifications to the device (similar requirements apply in other jurisdictions). Manufacturers determine in the first instance whether a change to a product requires a new 51o(k) clearance or premarket submission, but the FDA may review any manufacturer's decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances are necessary. We have made modifications to our products in the past and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA regulations and guidance that in certain instances new 51o(k) clearances or other premarket submissions were not required. We may make similar modifications or add additional features in the future that we believe do notrequire anew51o(k)clearance.If the FDA disagrees with our determinations and requires us to submit new 51 o(k) notifications, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance, and we may be subject to civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and damage to our reputation.

The Company's individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. \nAs a result of the Company's geographic and industry diversity, the Company faces a variety of opportunities and challenges, including rapid technological development (particularly with respect to computing, automation, artificial intelligence, mobile connectivity, communications and digitization) in most of the Company's served markets, the expansion and evolution of opportunities in high-growth markets, trends and costs associated with a global labor force, consolidation of the Company's competitors and increasing regulation. The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment in most markets and the Company's long-term growth and profitability will depend in particular on its ability to expand its business in high- growth geographies and high-growth market segments, identify, consummate and integrate appropriate acquisitions and identify and consummate appropriate investments and strategic partnerships, develop innovative and differentiated new products and services with higher gross profit margins, expand and improve the effectiveness of the Company's sales force, continue to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency and quality, and effectively address the demands of an increasingly regulated global environment. The Company is making significant investments, organically and through acquisitions and investments, to address the rapid pace of technological change in its served markets and to globalize its manufacturing, research and development and customer-facing resources (particularly in high-growth markets) in order to be responsive to the Company's customers throughout the world and improve the efficiency of the Company'soperations. \nTheCOVID-19Pandemic \nThe global spread of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to unprecedented restrictions on, and disruptions in, business and personal activities, including as a result of preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses, our communities and governments have taken and are taking to mitigate the spread of the virus and to manage its impact.The Company continues to actively monitor the pandemic and has taken and intends to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, the Company's business (including but not limited to its employees, customers, business partners, manufacturing capabilities and capacity, and supply and distribution channels) posed by the spread of COVID-19 and the governmental and community responses thereto. The Company's businesses have activated their business continuity plans in response to the pandemic, including taking steps in an effort to help keep our workforce healthy and safe, and are assessing and updating those plans on an ongoing basis. As a result of COVID-19 the Company's businesses have modified certain of their respective business practices (including in many cases with respect to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and the Company expects to take such further actions as may be required by government authorities or as determined to be in the best interests of our employees, customers and other business partners. The Company has developed return-to-work protocols designed to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, customers and business partners, for its businesses to apply as and when return-to-work is legally permissible and deemed appropriate.We are also working with our suppliers to understand the existing and potential future negative impacts to our supply chain and take actions in an effort to mitigate such impacts. To date we have not experienced any significant supply chain disruptions. Given that the prevalence of COVID-19 and the nature of the response thereto (including the degree to which restrictions are being relaxed or re-imposed) varies significantly by geography, the impact of the pandemic on the Company's different business locations around the world at any given time also varies significantly.

While patient volumes remained down year-over-year, the Company saw sequential improvement in patient volume from the second quarter of 2020 through the end of the year.Core sales in the segment's clinical lab business decreased on a year-over-year basis driven by lower demand across all major product lines. Geographically, shutdown measures to curb COVID-19 reduced core laboratory testing volumes year-over-year across all major geographies. Core sales increased in the molecular diagnostics business on a year-over-year basis in both developed and high-growth markets and contributed significantly to overall segment core sales growth. The molecular diagnostics business experienced particularly strong growth in sales of instruments and consumables in the infectious disease product line driven by the development and commercialization of diagnostic test solutions for COVID-19. Core sales in the acute care diagnostic business increased year-over-year primarily due to higher demand for blood gas instruments and consumables, driven in part by increased hospitalizations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Geographically, demand was strong across all major geographies. Core sales in the pathology business grew year-over-year driven by increased demand for advanced staining consumables and pathology imaging products. Geographically, core sales growth in the pathology business was led by North America and Western Europe, partially offset by soft demand inChina. \nOperating Profit Performance \nOperating profit margins increased 350 basis points during 2020 as compared to 2019. The following factors impacted year over-year operating profit margin comparisons. \n2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were favorably impacted by: \nHigher 2020 core sales volumes, lower overall spending levels for business travel and other business activities as a result of the pandemic and incremental year-over-year cost savings associated with the continued productivity improvement initiatives taken in 2020 and 2019, net of incremental year-over-year costs associated with various new product development and sales and marketing growth investments and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates in2020-355basispoints \n2020 vs. 2019 operating profit margin comparisons were unfavorably impacted by: Impairment charges related to a facility incurred in the first quarter of 2020 - 5 basis points \n\nDepreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales decreased during 2020 as compared with 2019 largely due to the impact ofincreasedsalesin2020. \nENVIRONMENTAL&APPLIED SOLUTIONS \nThe Company's Environmental & Applied Solutions segment offers products and services that help protect important resources and keep global food and water supplies safe.

The divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation. \nLOSSONEARLYEXTINGUISHMENTOFBORROWINGS \nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company redeemed the E800 million aggregate principal amount of  $1.7\\%$  seniorunsecured notes due 2022 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on early extinguishment of these borrowings of  $\\S26$  million (  $\\mathfrak{S}20$  million after-tax or  $\\S0.03$  per diluted common share) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using available cash balances, including proceeds from the fourth quarter 2020 issuance of the  $2.6\\%$  senior unsecured notes due 2050. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company redeemed the  $\\S500$  million aggregate principal amount of  $2.4\\%$  senior unsecured notes due 2020 and the  $\\S375$   million aggregate principal amount of  $5.0\\%$  senior unsecured notes due 2020 at a redemption price equal to the outstanding principal amount and a make-whole premium as specified in the applicable indenture, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of these borrowings of  $\\S7$  million (\\$5 million after-tax or  $\\S0.01$  per diluted common share) related to the payment of make-whole premiums in connection with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption using a portion of the cash distribution it received in connection with the Envista Disposition. \nINTERESTCOSTS \nInterest expense of  $\\S275$  million for 2020 was  $\\S167$  million higher than in 2019, due primarily to the impact of higher average debt balances as a result of the issuances of debt in 2019 and 2020 (primarily to fund the Cytiva Acquisition) and 2020 borrowings under the Company's  $\\S5.0$  billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that expires on August 27, 2024, subject to a one-year extension option at the request of the Company with the consent of the lenders (the \"Five-Year Facility\") and the Company's  $\\S5.0$  billion 364-day unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks that was scheduled to expire 0n August 26, 2020 (the “Superseded 364-Day Facility\"), prior to the subsequent repayment of such credit facility borrowings. Proceeds from these borrowings as well as available cash balances were used to fund the acquisitior of Cytiva and for general corporate purposes. Interest income of  $\\S71$  million for 2020 was  $\\S68$  million lower than in 2019, due primarily to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances in 2020 due to the funding of the Cytiva Acquisition \nIn January 2019, the Company entered into approximately  $\\S1.9$  billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts on its U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to effectively convert the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc and reduce the interest rate from the stated interest rates on the U.S. dollar denominated debt to the interest rates of the swaps.

The Company appealed these assessments to the Danish National\nTax Tribunal in 2014. The appeal is pending, awaiting the final outcome of other, preceding withholding tax cases that were\nappealed to the Danish courts and subsequently to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”). In February 2019, the\nCJEU decided several of these cases and ruled that the exemption of interest payments from withholding taxes provided in the\napplicable EU directive should be denied where taxpayers use the directive for abusive or fraudulent purposes, and that it is up\nto the national courts to make this determination.

The Company\ngenerally addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company also\nperiodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks. In addition, the\nCompany’s broad-based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may\nhave on its financial statements as a whole.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe Company manages interest cost using a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. A change in interest rates on fixed\nrate debt impacts the fair value of the debt but not the Company’s earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is\nfixed. Generally, the fair market value of fixed-rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise.\nAs of December 31, 2020, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the\nCompany’s fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of\nthis convertible debt was primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately $2.0 billion.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company’s variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of euro-based commercial paper\nborrowings (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s outstanding\ncommercial paper balances as of December 31, 2020). As a result, the Company’s primary interest rate exposure results from\nchanges in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term\ncommercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available.\nIn 2020, the average annual interest rate associated with the Company’s outstanding commercial paper borrowings was\napproximately negative 6 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to positive 13 basis points would have increased\nthe Company’s annual interest expense by $5 million. The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the\nCompany’s commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2020.\n\nRefer to “Results of Operations—Interest Costs” for discussion of the Company’s cross-currency swap derivative contracts and\ninterest rate swap agreements.\n\nCurrency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and\nfrom intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods\nand services in currencies other than Danaher’s functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The\nCompany also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations\ninto U.S. dollars, Danaher’s functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the\nUnited States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the\nCompany is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the\nCompany has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies\nstrengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change\nin currency exchange rates on the Company’s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity.\n\nCurrency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2020 reported sales on a year-over-year basis. If the currency\nexchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 were to prevail throughout 2021, currency exchange rates would increase\n2021 estimated sales relative to 2020 sales by approximately 3.0%. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major\ncurrencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 would adversely impact the Company’s sales and\nresults of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the\nexchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 would positively impact the Company’s sales and results of operations.\n\nThe Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments\nto manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-\ncurrency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.\nBoth positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported\namount of sales and net earnings in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets\nand liabilities held in foreign currencies. A 10% depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31,\n\n49\n", "vlm_text": "Company recorded losses from cash flow hedge adjustments related to the Company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts in2020of  $\\S72$  million compared to losses of  $\\mathbb{S}113$  millionin2019. \nFINANCIALINSTRUMENTSANDRISKMANAGEMENT \nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices and commodity prices as well as credit risk, each of which could impact its Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2020, an increase of 100 basis points in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of the Company's fixed-rate long-term debt (excluding the LYONs, which have not been included in this calculation as the value of this convertible debt was primarily derived from the value of its underlying common stock) by approximately  $\\S2.0$  billion. \nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's variable-rate debt obligations consisted primarily of euro-based commercial paper borrowings (refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company's outstanding commercial paper balances as of December 31, 2020). As a result, the Company's primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short-term interest rates. As these shorter duration obligations mature, the Company may issue additional short-term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings, to the extent commercial paper markets are available. In 2020, the average annual interest rate associated with the Company's outstanding commercial paper borrowings was approximately negative 6 basis points. A hypothetical increase of this average to positive 13 basis points would have increased theCompany's annual interest expenseby  $\\S5$  million.The hypothetical increase used is the actual amount by which the Company's commercial paper interest rates fluctuated during 2020. \nRefer to “Results of Operations—-Interest Costs\" for discussion of the Company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts and interest rate swap agreements. \nCurrency Exchange Rate Risk \nThe Company faces transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside the United States and from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than Danaher's functional currency or the functional currency of its applicable subsidiary. The Company also faces translational exchange rate risk related to the translation of financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars, Danaher's functional currency. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar. In particular, the Company has more sales in European currencies than it has expenses in those currencies. Therefore, when European currencies strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar, operating profits are increased or decreased, respectively. The effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the Company's net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component of stockholders’ equity. \nCurrency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on 2020 reported sales on a year-over-year basis. If the currency exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 were to prevail throughout 2021, currency exchange rates would increase 2021 estimated sales relative to 2020 sales by approximately  $3.0\\%$  .Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31,2020 would adversely impact the Company'ssalesand results of operations on an overall basis. Any weakening of the U.S. dollar against other major currencies compared to the exchange rates in effect as of December 31, 2020 would positively impact the Company's sales and results of operations \nThe Company has generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this transactional exchange risk, although the Company has used foreign currency-denominated debt and cross- currency swaps to hedge a portion of its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. Both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales and net earnings in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, the Company has assets and liabilitiesheld in foreign currencies.A  $10\\%$  depreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of December 31, 2020 would have reduced foreign currency-denominated net assets and stockholders’ equity by approximately  $\\S1.5$  billion.As ofDecember31,2020,theCompanyhad  $\\S2.0$  billion of cross-currency swap derivative contracts outstanding ashedges of its net investment in foreign operations. These contracts effectively convert the Company's U.S. dollar-denominated bonds to obligations denominated in Danish kroner, Japanese yen, euro and Swiss franc, and partially offset the impact of changes in currency rates on foreign currency-denominated net assets during the term of the swap. The Company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge U.S.dollar-denominatedlong-term debt issuance s in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro against adverse movements in exchange rates between the U.s. dollar and the euro.For a further description of the Company's cross-currency swap derivative contracts as of December 31, 2020 refer to Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition, in 2020 and 2019, the Company invested $342 million and $241 million, respectively, in\nnon-marketable equity securities and partnerships.\n\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five businesses for total consideration of $331 million in cash, net of cash acquired. The\nbusinesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company’s three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these\nbusinesses at the time of their acquisition, in each case based on the companies’ revenues for its last completed fiscal year prior\nto the acquisition, were $72 million.\n\nRefer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company’s transfer of its\nformer dental business to Envista Holdings Corporation.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development,\nimproving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease\narrangements that certain of the Company’s businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled $791 million in\n2020 and $636 million in 2019. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2020 was primarily due to capital\nexpenditures to support production of products supporting customers’ efforts related to testing, treatment and vaccine\nproduction for COVID-19 and capital expenditures at Cytiva, partially offset by declines in expenditures for instruments used in\nOTL arrangements. In 2021, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year, to primarily support\nproduction of products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19. The Company’s actual expenditures\nwill ultimately depend on business conditions, including demand for the Company’s products related to COVID-19, regulatory\nrequirements, and the capability of suppliers to support increased production. As a result, the Company estimates capital\nexpenditures in 2021 to be between approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial\npaper, issuance and repayment of long-term debt, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and\npayments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately $1.0 billion during 2020\ncompared to approximately $16.4 billion of cash provided during 2019. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by\nfinancing activities was due primarily to the significant borrowings incurred in 2019 to finance the Cytiva Acquisition, partially\noffset by borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate\npurposes.\n\nTotal debt was approximately $21.2 billion and $21.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and notes\npayable and current portion of long-term debt was $11 million and $212 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.

In addition, in 2020 and 2019, the Company invested \\$342 million and  $\\S241$  million, respectively, in non-marketable equity securities and partnerships \nDuring 2019, the Company acquired five businesses for total consideration of  $\\S331$  million in cash, net of cash acquired. The businesses acquired complement existing units of each of the Company's three segments. The aggregate annual sales of these businesses atthetime of their acquisition,ineachcasebased onthecompanies’revenues for its last completed fiscal year prioi to the acquisition,were  $\\S72$  million. \nRefer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's transfer of its former dental business to Envista Holdings Corporation. \nCapitalExpenditures \nCapital expenditures are made primarily for increasing capacity, replacing equipment, supporting new product development, improving information technology systems and the manufacture of instruments that are used in operating-type lease arrangements that certain of the Company's businesses enter into with customers. Capital expenditures totaled  $\\S791$  millionin 2020and  $\\S636$  million in 2019. The year-over-year increase in capital spending in 2020 was primarily due to capital expenditures to support production of products supporting customers’ efforts related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19 and capital expenditures at Cytiva, partially offset by declines in expenditures for instruments used in OTL arrangements. In 2021, the Company expects to incur higher capital spending than the prior year, to primarily support production of products related to testing, treatment and vaccine production for COVID-19. The Company's actual expenditures will ultimately depend on business conditions, including demand for the Company's products related to COVID-19, regulatory requirements, and the capability of suppliers to support increased production. As a result, the Company estimates capital expenditures in 2021 to be between approximately  $\\S1.0$  billionand  $\\S1.2$  billion. \nFinancing Activities \nCash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with the issuance and repayments of commercial paper, issuance and repayment oflong-term debt, issuance and repurchases of common stock, issuance of preferred stock and payments of cash dividends to shareholders. Financing activities provided cash of approximately  $\\S1.0$  billion during 2020 compared to approximately  $\\S16.4$  billion of cash provided during 2019. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to the significant borrowings incurred in 2019 to finance the Cytiva Acquisition, partially offset by borrowings incurred in 2020 to finance the remaining amounts needed to acquire Cytiva and for general corporate purposes. \nTotal debt was approximately  $\\S21.2$  billion and  $\\S21.7$  billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and notes payable and current portion of long-term debt was  $\\S11$   million and  $\\S212$  million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had the ability to incur approximately  $\\S4.4$  billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings or under the outstanding commercial paper facilities based on the amounts available under the Company's  $\\S5.0$  billion Five-Year Facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balances. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has classified  $\\S611$   million of its borrowings outstanding under the euro-denominated commercial paper program and  $\\S290$  million of borrowings outstanding under the 2021 Yen Notes as long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the Five-Year Facility, to refinance these borrowings for at least one year from the balance sheet date.

The fair values of acquired intangibles are\ndetermined using information available near the acquisition date based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed\nreasonable by the Company. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of\nthe forecasted results of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization\n(“EBITDA”), growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could\nbe affected by future economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the\nCompany’s critical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant\nacquisitions. In connection with acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized aggregate\ngoodwill of approximately $10.4 billion and intangible assets of approximately $10.7 billion.

In evaluating the\nestimates derived by the market-based approach, management makes judgments about the relevance and reliability of the\nmultiples by considering factors unique to its reporting units, including operating results, business plans, economic projections,\nanticipated future cash flows, and transactions and marketplace data as well as judgments about the comparability of the market\nproxies selected.

In connection with acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized aggregate goodwill of approximately  $\\S10.4$  billion and intangible assets of approximately  $\\S10.7$  billion. Refer to Notes 1, 3 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's policies relating to goodwill, acquired intangibles and acquisitions. \nIn performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units primarily using a market-based approach which relies on current trading multiples of forecasted EBITDA for companies operating in businesses similar to each of the Company's reporting units to calculate an estimated fair value of each reporting unit.

Based on this hypothetical  $10\\%$  decrease, the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value (expressed as a percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit) for each of the Company's reporting units ranged from approximately  $60\\%$  toapproximately  $615\\%$  "}

Determining whether an impairment loss occurred for finite-lived intangibles\nrequires a comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset.\nThese analyses require management to make judgments and estimates about future revenues, expenses, market conditions and\ndiscount rates related to these assets. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more\nfrequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. Determining whether an impairment\nloss occurred for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets and\ncomparing the fair value to their carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an\nimpairment loss. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of intangible assets impairment\ncharges recorded during 2020.\n\nIf actual results are not consistent with management’s estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be\noverstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company’s financial\nstatements. Historically, the Company’s estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct.\n\nContingent Liabilities—As discussed in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the\nCompany is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or\nthe business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is\nknown or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as\nlitigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both\npending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may\nchange in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If\nthe reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be\nrequired to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the\nCompany’s financial statements.\n\nRevenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services. Revenue is recognized when\ncontrol over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the\nCompany expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, the Company\nconsiders whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment,\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the\nconsideration that the customer owes the Company, the Company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer\nallowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with\ncustomers which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Refer to\nNotes | and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company’s revenue recognition policies.\n\nIf the Company’s judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company’s reported revenues in particular\nperiods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company’s estimates of revenue have been materially correct.\n\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit\naccounting practices, refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension\nand other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including\nassumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates,\nmortality rates and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and\nobligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience,\nchanges in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company’s financial statements could be materially affected. A 50\nbasis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by $144 million\n($110 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $191 million ($147 million on an after-tax basis) from\nthe amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point increase in the\ndiscount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by $133 million ($101 million on an after-tax\nbasis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by $175 million ($135 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020.\n\nFor 2020, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans was 7.0%, and the Company intends to use an assumption of\n6.75% for 2021. The estimated long-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on\n\n56\n", "vlm_text": "\nThe Company reviews identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable.

If the fair value is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairmentloss.Refer toNote8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of intangible assets impairment charges recorded during 2020. \nIf actual results are not consistent with management's estimates and assumptions, goodwill and other intangible assets may be overstated and a charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the Company's financial statements. Historically, the Company's estimates of goodwill and intangible assets have been materially correct. \nContingent Liabilities—As discussedin\"Item3.Legal Proceedings\"andNote18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements,the Company is, from time to time, subject to a variety of litigation and similar contingent liabilities incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities). The Company recognizes a liability for any legal contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. These assessments require judgments concerning matters such as litigation developments and outcomes, the anticipated outcome of negotiations, the number of future claims and the cost of both pending and future claims. In addition, because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to various factors, including those discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If the reserves established by the Company with respect to these contingent liabilities are inadequate, the Company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserves, which would adversely affect the Company's financial statements. \nRevenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues from the sale of products and services.Revenue is recognized when control over the promised products or services is transferred to the customer in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In determining if control has transferred, the Company considers whether certain indicators of the transfer of control are present, such as the transfer of title, present right to payment, significant risks and rewards of ownership and customer acceptance when acceptance is not a formality. To determine the consideration that the customer owes the Company, the Company must make judgments regarding the amount of customer allowances and rebates, as well as an estimate for product returns. The Company also enters into lease arrangements with customers which requires the Company to determine whether the arrangements are operating or sales-type leases. Refer to Notes 1 and 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the Company's revenue recognition policies \nIf the Company's judgments regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect, the Company's reported revenues in particular periods may be incorrect. Historically, the Company's estimates of revenue have been materially correct. \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits—For a description of the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practices, refer to Notes 13 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Calculations of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations depend on the assumptions used in the actuarial valuations, including assumptions regarding discount rates, expected return on plan assets, rates of salary increases, health care cost trend rates, mortality rates and other factors. If the assumptions used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are incorrect or if the factors underlying the assumptions change (as a result of differences in actual experience, changes in key economic indicators or other factors) the Company's financial statements could be materially affected. A 50 basis point reduction in the discount rates used for the plans would have increased the U.S. net obligation by  $\\S144$  million (\\$11o0 million on an after-tax basis) and the non-U.S. net obligation by  $\\S191$  million (\\$147 million on an after-tax basis) from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. A 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used for the plans would have decreased the U.S. net obligation by  $\\S133$  million(  $\\mathfrak{S}101$  million on an after-tax basis)and thenon-U.S.net obligationby  $\\S175$  million(\\$135million on an after-taxbasis)from the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements as of December 31, 2020. \nFor 2020, the estimated long-term rate of return for the U.S. plans was  $7.0\\%$  ,and the Company intends touse an assumption of  $6.75\\%$  for 2021.The estimated 1ong-term rate of return for the non-U.S. plans was determined on a plan-by-plan basis based on the nature of the plan assets and ranged from  $0.5\\%$  to  $5.0\\%$  . If the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2020 was reduced by 50 basis points, pension expense for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans for 2020 would have increased  $\\S9$  million (\\$7 million on an after-tax basis) and  $\\S6$  million (\\$4 million on an after-tax basis), respectively.

{"page": 83, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_DHR_2020_83.jpg", "ocr_text": "Uncertain Tax Positions\n\nDescription As discussed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company operates in the U.S. and multiple\n\nof the international tax jurisdictions and as a result files numerous tax returns in those locations. Uncertainty in a tax\n\nMatter position may arise for multiple reasons, including because tax laws are subject to interpretation. For some\nmatters, the Company uses judgment to (1) determine whether, based on the technical merits, a tax position is\nmore likely than not to be sustained and (2) measure the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As\nof December 31, 2020, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were\napproximately $1.2 billion. As further discussed in Note 15, if the Internal Revenue Service proposes\nadjustments related to the Company's self-insurance programs and if the Company is unsuccessful in defending\nits position the Company may be required to record a charge against future earnings. The Company believes its\npositions related to the self-insurance programs are more likely than not sustainable and accordingly has no\nunrecognized tax benefit related to these self-insurance programs.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the resolution of some of these tax matters, auditing the Company’s\nuncertain tax positions and the related unrecognized tax benefits is complex and required the use of tax subject\nmatter resources to determine whether the more likely than not criteria was met.\n\nHow We We tested controls over management’s accounting for uncertain tax positions, including assessment of the\nAddressed technical merits of tax positions.\n\nthe Matter To evaluate whether the technical merits of some uncertain tax positions are more likely than not sustainable,\n\nin Our Audit our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, court cases, tax regulations and\nother regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter resources. We also involved tax subject matter resources in\nverifying our understanding of the relevant facts and analysis by reading relevant correspondence with the tax\nauthority and reading third-party advice obtained by management. We also evaluated the adequacy of the\nCompany’s disclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters.\n\nAccounting for the Acquisition of Cytiva\nDescription As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the\nof the Biopharma business now known as Cytiva, for a purchase price of $20.7 billion. The transaction was accounted\nMatter for as a business combination. As part of the allocation of the purchase price, the Company estimated the fair\nvalue of finite-lived intangible assets to be $10.7 billion, comprised of product trade names, developed\ntechnology and customer relationships.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Cytiva was complex due to the estimation uncertainty\nin determining the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to\nthe sensitivity of the respective assets’ fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of\nCytiva and other related valuation assumptions.

As further discussed in Note 15, if the Internal Revenue Service proposes adjustments related to the Company's self-insurance programs and if the Company is unsuccessful in defending its position the Company may be required to record a charge against future earnings. The Company believes its positions related to the self-insurance programs are more likely than not sustainable and accordingly has no unrecognized tax benefit related to these self-insurance programs. \nDue to the inherent uncertainty in predicting the resolution of some of these tax matters, auditing the Company's uncertain tax positions and the related unrecognized tax benefits is complex and required the use of tax subject matter resources to determine whether themorelikely than not criteriawasmet. \nHowWe Addressed theMatter inOurAudit \nDescription ofthe Matter \nWe tested controls over management's accounting for uncertain tax positions, including assessment of the technical merits of tax positions. \nTo evaluate whether the technical merits of some uncertain tax positions are more likely than not sustainable our audit procedures included, among others, evaluation of applicable tax law, court cases, tax regulations and other regulatory guidance by our tax subject matter resources.We also involved tax subject matter resources in verifying our understanding of the relevant facts and analysis by reading relevant correspondence with the tax authority and reading third-party advice obtained by management.We also evaluated the adequacy of the Company's disclosures included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in relation to these matters. \nAccounting for the Acquisition of Cytiva \nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, on March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business now known as Cytiva, for a purchase price of  $\\S20.7$  billion.The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. As part of the allocation of the purchase price, the Company estimated the fair value of finite-lived intangible assetstobe  $\\S10.7$  billion, comprised of product trade names, developed technology and customer relationships. \nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Cytiva was complex due to the estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets. The estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective assets’ fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of Cytiva and other related valuation assumptions. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of these assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results including revenue and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization) growth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates.These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. \nHowWe Addressed theMatter inOurAudit We tested the Company's controls over its accounting for acquisitions, including controls over management's review of the significant assumptions described above. To test the estimated fair value of these intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others,evaluating the Company's use of the selected valuation model and testing the significant assumptions used in the model and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we compared certain assumptions to current market and economic trends, to historical results of the acquired business, to assumptions used by guideline companies within the industry,and to internal communications andanalysis Our valuation specialists assisted with the evaluation of the valuation model selected and certain assumptions including the discount rate, royalty rates and technological obsolescence rates. \n\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002 \nTysons, Virginia February 24,2021 "}

As of December 31, 2020, the Company operates in three business segments: Life\nSciences; Diagnostics; and Environmental & Applied Solutions.\n\nThe Company’s Life Sciences segment offers a broad range of instruments and consumables that are primarily used by\ncustomers to study the basic building blocks of life, including genes, proteins, metabolites and cells, in order to understand the\ncauses of disease, identify new therapies, and test and manufacture new drugs and vaccines.\n\nThe Company’s Diagnostics segment offers analytical instruments, reagents, consumables, software and services that hospitals,\nphysicians’ offices, reference laboratories and other critical care settings use to diagnose disease and make treatment decisions.\n\nThe Company’s Environmental & Applied Solutions segment offers products and services that help protect important resources\nand keep global food and water supplies safe. The Company’s water quality business provides instrumentation, consumables,\nsoftware, services and disinfection systems to help analyze, treat and manage the quality of ultra-pure, potable, industrial,\nwaste, ground, source and ocean water in residential, commercial, municipal, industrial and natural resource applications. The\nCompany’s product identification business provides instruments, software, services and consumables for various color and\nappearance management, packaging design and quality management, packaging converting, printing, marking, coding and\ntraceability applications for consumer, pharmaceutical and industrial products.\n\nRefer to Notes 3 and 4 for a discussion of significant acquisitions, discontinued operations and other dispositions.\n\nAccounting Principles—The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

The\nConsolidated Financial Statements also reflect the impact of noncontrolling interests. Noncontrolling interests do not have a\nsignificant impact on the Company’s consolidated results of continuing operations, therefore earnings attributable to\nnoncontrolling interests for continuing operations are not presented separately in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings. Earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests have been reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses\nand were insignificant in all periods presented.

The Company bases these estimates on\nhistorical experience, the current economic environment and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable\nunder the circumstances. However, uncertainties associated with these estimates exist and actual results may differ materially\nfrom these estimates.\n\nCash and Equivalents—The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date\nof purchase to be cash equivalents.\n\nAccounts Receivable and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts—AII trade accounts, contract and finance receivables are reported\non the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for any write-offs and net of allowances for doubtful accounts.\n\nThe allowances for doubtful accounts represent management’s best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the\nCompany’s trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios.

The allowances for doubtful accounts represent management's best estimate of the expected future credit losses from the Company's trade accounts, contract and finance receivable portfolios. Determination of the allowances requires management to exercise judgment aboutthetiming,frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for credit losses and, therefore, net earnings. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of its portfolios to determine if an impairment has occurred and evaluates the collectability of receivables based on a combination of various financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers’ ability to pay, including customers² financial condition, collateral, debt-servicing ability, past payment experience and credit bureau information.

If the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate,resultingin an impairment of their ability to make payments,additional reserves would be required. The Company does not believe that trade accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas.

Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized. In-process research and development\n(“IPR&D”) is initially capitalized at fair value and when the IPR&D project is complete, the asset is considered a finite-lived\nintangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life.

The Company reviews identified intangible assets and\ngoodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be\nrecoverable. The Company also tests intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment at least annually.\nRefer to Notes 3 and 8 for additional information about the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nRevenue Recognition—The Company derives revenues primarily from the sale of Life Sciences, Diagnostics and\nEnvironmental & Applied Solutions products and services. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or\nservices is transferred to the Company’s customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be\nentitled to in exchange for those products or services (the transaction price). A performance obligation is a promise in a\ncontract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standards\nCodification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. For equipment, consumables and most software licenses\nsold by the Company, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. To indicate the transfer of control, the Company must\nhave a present right to payment, legal title must have passed to the customer, the customer must have the significant risks and\nrewards of ownership, and where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have accepted the product or service. The\nCompany’s principal terms of sale are FOB Shipping Point, or equivalent, and, as such, the Company primarily transfers\ncontrol and records revenue for product sales upon shipment. Sales arrangements with delivery terms that are not FOB\nShipping Point are not recognized upon shipment and the transfer of control for revenue recognition is evaluated based on the\nassociated shipping terms and customer obligations. If a performance obligation to the customer with respect to a sales\ntransaction remains to be fulfilled following shipment (typically installation or acceptance by the customer), revenue\nrecognition for that performance obligation is deferred until such commitments have been fulfilled. Returns for products sold\nare estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale. Customer allowances and rebates, consisting primarily\nof volume discounts and other short-term incentive programs, are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale because\nthese allowances reflect a reduction in the transaction price. Product returns, customer allowances and rebates are estimated\nbased on historical experience and known trends. For extended warranty, service, post contract support (“PCS”), software-as-a-\nservice (“SaaS”) and other long-term contracts, control transfers to the customer over the term of the arrangement. Revenue for\nextended warranty, service, PCS, SaaS and certain software licenses is recognized based upon the period of time elapsed under\nthe arrangement. Revenue for other long-term contracts is generally recognized based upon the cost-to-cost measure of\nprogress, provided that the Company meets the criteria associated with transferring control of the good or service over time.\n\nCertain of the Company’s revenues relate to operating-type lease (“OTL”) arrangements. Leases are outside the scope of ASC\n606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases (or ASC 840, Leases (“ASC 840”) prior to January 1,\n2019). Equipment lease revenue for OTL agreements is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease, and the\ncost of customer-leased equipment is recorded within property, plant and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance\nSheets and depreciated over the equipment’s estimated useful life. Depreciation expense associated with the leased equipment\nunder OTL arrangements is reflected in cost of sales in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The OTLs are\ngenerally not cancellable until after an initial term and may or may not require the customer to purchase a minimum number of\nconsumables or tests throughout the contract term. The Company also enters into sales-type lease (“STL”) arrangements with\ncustomers which result in earlier recognition of equipment lease revenue as compared to an OTL.\n\nFor a contract with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each\nperformance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis using the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling\nprice of each distinct product or service in the contract. The primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the\nprice observed in standalone sales to customers; however, when prices in standalone sales are not available the Company may\nuse third-party pricing for similar products or services or estimate the standalone selling price. Allocation of the transaction\nprice is determined at the contracts’ inception.\n\nShipping and Handling—Shipping and handling costs are included as a component of cost of sales. Revenue derived from\nshipping and handling costs billed to customers is included in sales.\n\nAdvertising—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\n\nResearch and Development—The Company conducts research and development activities for the purpose of developing new\nproducts, enhancing the functionality, effectiveness, ease of use and reliability of the Company’s existing products and\n\n70\n", "vlm_text": "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets-Goodwill and other intangible assets result from the Company's acquisition of existing businesses.

Research and development costs are\nexpensed as incurred.\n\nIncome Taxes—The Company’s income tax expense represents the tax liability for the current year, the tax benefit or expense\nfor the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year, as well as reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and\nreturn to provision adjustments. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial\nstatement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the\ndifferences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company’s\ntax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nEarnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all\nof the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a\ndeduction on the Company’s tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company’s Consolidated\nStatements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax\nexpense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon\nthe technical merits, it is “more likely than not” that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination.\nJudgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the\ntechnical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a\ntax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable\nstatute of limitations expires. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized\ntax positions in income tax expense. Refer to Note 15 for additional information and discussion of the impact of the enactment\nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) in the United States.\n\nProductivity Improvement and Restructuring—The Company periodically initiates productivity improvement and restructuring\nactivities to appropriately position the Company’s cost base relative to prevailing economic conditions and associated customer\ndemand as well as in connection with certain acquisitions. Costs associated with productivity improvement and restructuring\nactions can include one-time termination benefits and related charges in addition to facility closure, contract termination and\nother related activities. The Company records the cost of the productivity improvement and restructuring activities when the\nassociated liability is incurred.\n\nForeign Currency Translation—Exchange rate adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in net\nearnings, whereas effects resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the\nUnited States with a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using year end exchange rates\nand income statement accounts are translated at weighted average rates. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses were\nnot material in any of the years presented. As discussed below, the Company uses its foreign currency-denominated debt and\ncross-currency swap arrangements whereby existing U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings are effectively converted to foreign\ncurrency borrowings to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates.\n\nDerivative Financial Instruments—The Company is neither a dealer nor a trader in derivative instruments. The Company has\ngenerally accepted the exposure to transactional exchange rate movements without using derivative instruments to manage this\nrisk, although the Company from time to time partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse\nmovements in exchange rates through foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps. The Company will\nperiodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of its foreign currency exchange risk and\nforward starting swaps to mitigate interest rate risk related to the Company’s debt. The Company also uses cross-currency\nswap derivative contracts to hedge long-term debt issuances in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of the\nborrower. When utilized, the derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or\nliability measured at fair value. To the extent the derivative instrument qualifies as an effective hedge, changes in fair value are\nrecognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. \nIncome Taxes—The Company's income tax expense represents the tax liability for the current year, the tax benefit or expense for the net change in deferred tax liabilities and assets during the year, as well as reserves for unrecognized tax benefits and return to provision adjustments.Deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the Company's tax return in future years for which the tax benefit has already been reflected on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent items that have already been taken as a deduction on the Company's tax return but have not yet been recognized as an expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company provides for unrecognized tax benefits when, based upon the technical merits, it is “more likely than not' that an uncertain tax position will not be sustained upon examination. Judgment is required in evaluating tax positions and determining income tax provisions. The Company re-evaluates the technical merits of its tax positions and may recognize an uncertain tax benefit in certain circumstances, including when: (1) a tax audit is completed; (2) applicable tax laws change, including a tax case ruling or legislative guidance; or (3) the applicable statute of limitations expires. The Company recognizes potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions in income tax expense. Refer to Note 15 for additional information and discussion of the impact of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA\")in the United States \nProductivity Improvement and Restructuring—The Company periodically initiates productivity improvement and restructuring activities to appropriately position the Company's cost base relative to prevailing economic conditions and associated customer demand as well as in connection with certain acquisitions. Costs associated with productivity improvement and restructuring actions can include one-time termination benefits and related charges in addition to facility closure, contract termination and other related activities. The Company records the cost of the productivity improvement and restructuring activities when the associated liability is incurred. \nForeign Currency Translation—Exchange rate adjustments resulting from foreign currency transactions are recognized in net earnings, whereas effects resulting from the translation of financial statements are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.s. dollars are translated into U.s. dollars using year end exchange rates and income statement accounts are translated at weighted average rates. Net foreign currency transaction gains or losses were not material in any of the years presented. As discussed below, the Company uses its foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swap arrangements whereby existing U.S. dollar-denominated borrowings are effectively converted to foreign currency borrowing s to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. \nDerivative Financial Instruments—The Company is neither a dealer nor a trader in derivative instruments. The Company has generally accepted the exposure to transactional exchange rate movements without using derivative instruments to manage this risk, although the Company from time to time partially hedges its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates through foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency swaps. The Company will periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate a portion of its foreign currency exchange risk and forward starting swaps to mitigate interest rate risk related to the Company's debt. The Company also uses cross-currency swap derivative contracts to hedge long-term debt issuances in a foreign currency other than the functional currency of the borrower. When utilized, the derivative instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. To the extent the derivative instrument qualifies as an effective hedge, changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders? equity. Changes in the value of the foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges of the Company's net investment in foreign operations based on spot rates are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity and offset changes in the value of the Company's foreign currency denominated operations.

Examples of these consumables include reagents used in diagnostic tests, filters used in filtration, separation\nand purification processes and cartridges for marking and coding equipment. Additionally, some of the Company’s\nconsumables are used on a standalone basis, such as water treatment solutions. The Company separates its goods and services\nbetween those typically sold to a customer on a recurring basis and those typically sold to a customer on a nonrecurring basis.\nRecurring revenue includes revenue from consumables, services, software licenses recognized over time, SaaS licenses, sales-\nand-usage based royalties and OTLs. Nonrecurring revenue includes sales from equipment, software licenses recognized at a\npoint in time and STLs. OTLs and STLs are included in the above revenue amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018, lease revenue was $444 million, $432 million and $401 million, respectively.\n\nRemaining Performance Obligations\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations with an\noriginal contract term greater than one year which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period. Remaining\nperformance obligations include noncancelable purchase orders, the non-lease portion of minimum purchase commitments\nunder long-term consumable supply arrangements, extended warranty, service and PCS contracts, SaaS and other long-term\ncontracts. These remaining performance obligations do not include revenue from contracts with customers with an original\nterm of one year or less, revenue from long-term consumable supply arrangements with no minimum purchase requirements or\nrevenue expected from purchases made in excess of the minimum purchase requirements or revenue from equipment leased to\ncustomers. While the remaining performance obligation disclosure is similar in concept to backlog, the definition of remaining\nperformance obligations excludes leases and contracts that provide the customer with the right to cancel or terminate for\nconvenience with no substantial penalty, even if historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is\nremote. Additionally, the Company has elected to exclude contracts with customers with an original term of one year or less\nfrom remaining performance obligations while these contracts are included within backlog.\n\nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was\napproximately $3.0 billion. The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately 50% of the remaining performance\nobligations over the next 12 months, 23% over the subsequent 12 months, and the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nContract Balances\n\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed trade accounts receivable, unbilled receivables\n(“contract assets”) and deferred revenue, customer deposits and billings in excess of revenue recognized (“contract liabilities”)\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company defers certain costs incurred to obtain a contract (“contract\ncosts”).\n\nContract Assets—Most of the Company’s long-term contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract\nterms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. Often this results in billing\noccurring subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract assets. Contract assets are generally classified as other current\nassets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance of contract assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $65 million\nand $77 million, respectively.\n\nContract Liabilities—The Company often receives cash payments from customers in advance of the Company’s performance\nresulting in contract liabilities. These contract liabilities are classified as either current or long-term in the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\ncontract liabilities were approximately $1.4 billion and $806 million, respectively, and are included within accrued expenses\nand other liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the\ncontract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance\nof satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions, partially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included\nin the opening contract liability balance. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31,\n2019 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions,\npartially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liability balance. Revenue\nrecognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was\n$638 million and $603 million, respectively.\n\nContract Costs—The Company capitalizes certain direct incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract, typically sales-related\ncommissions, where the amortization period for the related asset is greater than one year. These costs are amortized over the\ncontract term or a longer period, generally the expected life of the customer relationship if renewals are expected and the\nrenewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.

Nonrecurring revenue includes sales from equipment, software licenses recognized at a point in time and STLs. OTLs and STLs are included in the above revenue amounts. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,lease revenue was  $\\S444$  million,  $\\S432$  million and  $\\mathbb{S}401$  million,respectively. \nRemaining Performance Obligations \nRemaining performance obligations represent the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations with an original contract term greater than one year which are fully or partially unsatisfied at the end of the period. Remaining performance obligations include non cancel able purchase orders,thenon-lease portion of minimum purchase commitments under long-term consumable supply arrangements, extended warranty, service and PCS contracts, SaaS and other long-term contracts. These remaining performance obligations do not include revenue from contracts with customers with an original term of one year or less, revenue from long-term consumable supply arrangements with no minimum purchase requirements or revenue expected from purchases made in excess of the minimum purchase requirements or revenue from equipment leased to customers. While the remaining performance obligation disclosure is similar in concept to backlog, the definition of remaining performance obligations excludes leases and contracts that provide the customer with theright to cancel or terminate for convenience with no substantial penalty, even if historical experience indicates the likelihood of cancellation or termination is remote. Additionally, the Company has elected to exclude contracts with customers with an original term of one year or less from remaining performance obligations while these contracts are included within backlog. \nAs of December 31, 2020, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was approximately  $\\S3.0$  billion.The Company expects to recognize revenue on approximately  $50\\%$  of the remaining performance obligations over thenext 12 months,  $23\\%$  over the subsequent 12 months, and the remainder recognized thereafter. \nContract Balances \nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed trade accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (\"contract assets\") and deferred revenue,customer deposits and billings in excess of revenue recognized(contract liabilities\") on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.In addition,the Company defers certain costs incurred to obtain a contract(contract cOsts\"). \nContract Assets—Most of the Company's long-term contracts are billed as work progresses in accordance with the contract terms and conditions, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of certain milestones. Often this results in billing occurring subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract assets. Contract assets are generally classified as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance of contract assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was  $\\S65$  million and\\$77million,respectively \nContract Liabilities—The Company often receives cash payments from customers in advance of the Company's performance resultingin contract liabilities.These contract liabilities areclassified as either current orlong-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, contract liabilities were approximately  $\\S1.4$  billionand  $\\S806$  million, respectively, and are included within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions, partially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liability balance. The increase in the contract liability balance during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily a result of cash payments received in advance of satisfying performance obligations and acquisitions, partially offset by revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liability balance. Revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was  $\\S638$  million and  $\\S603$  million,respectively. \nContract Costs—The Company capitalizes certain direct incremental costs incurred to obtain a contract, typically sales-related commissions,wherethe amortization period for therelated assetisgreater than oneyear.These costs are amortized over the contract term or alonger period,generally theexpectedlife of the customer relationshipif renewals areexpected and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission. Contract costs are classified as current or long-term other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the expense and are generally amortized into earnings on a straight-line basis (which is consistent with the transfer of control for the related goods or services). Management assesses these costs for impairment at least quarterly and as \"triggering\" events occur that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. The balance of contract costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were not significant. Amortization expense related to these costs for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was also not significant. The costs to obtain a contract where the amortization period for the related asset is one year or less are expensed as incurred and recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

ACQUISITIONS\n\nThe Company continually evaluates potential acquisitions that either strategically fit with the Company’s existing portfolio or\nexpand the Company’s portfolio into a new and attractive business area. The Company has completed a number of acquisitions\nand the purchases of the acquired businesses have resulted in the recognition of goodwill in the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. This goodwill arises because the purchase prices for these businesses reflect a number of factors\nincluding the future earnings and cash flow potential of these businesses, the multiple to earnings, cash flow and other factors at\nwhich similar businesses have been purchased by other acquirers, the competitive nature of the processes by which the\nCompany acquired the businesses, the avoidance of the time and costs which would be required (and the associated risks that\nwould be encountered) to enhance the Company’s existing product offerings to key target markets and enter into new and\nprofitable businesses and the complementary strategic fit and resulting synergies these businesses bring to existing operations.\n\nThe Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair\nvalue of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. The Company obtains the information used for the purchase price\nallocation during due diligence and through other sources. In the months after closing, as the Company obtains additional\ninformation about the acquired assets and liabilities, including through tangible and intangible asset appraisals, and learns more\nabout the newly acquired business, it is able to refine the estimates of fair value and more accurately allocate the purchase price.\nThe fair values of acquired intangibles are determined based on estimates and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by the\nCompany. Significant assumptions include the discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted\nresults of the acquired business including revenue, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”),\ngrowth rates, royalty rates and technology obsolescence rates. These assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by\nfuture economic and market conditions. The Company engages third-party valuation specialists who review the Company’s\ncritical assumptions and calculations of the fair value of acquired intangible assets in connection with significant acquisitions.\nOnly facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date are considered for subsequent adjustment. The Company is\ncontinuing to evaluate certain pre-acquisition contingencies associated with certain of its 2020 acquisitions (including the\nacquisition of Cytiva, as described below) and is also in the process of obtaining valuations of certain acquisition-related assets\nand liabilities in connection with these acquisitions. The Company will make appropriate adjustments to the purchase price\nallocation prior to completion of the measurement period, as required.\n\nThe following briefly describes the Company’s acquisition activity for the three years ended December 31, 2020.\n\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company acquired the Biopharma business of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) Life Sciences\ndivision, now known as Cytiva, for a cash purchase price of approximately $20.7 billion (net of approximately $0.1 billion of\nacquired cash) and the assumption of approximately $0.4 billion of pension liabilities (the “Cytiva Acquisition”). Cytiva is a\nleading provider of instruments, consumables and software that support the research, discovery, process development and\nmanufacturing workflows of biopharmaceutical drugs. Cytiva is included in the Company’s Life Sciences segment results\nbeginning in the second quarter of 2020. The acquisition has provided and is expected to provide additional sales and earnings\ngrowth opportunities for the Company’s Life Sciences segment by expanding the business’ geographic and product line\ndiversity, including new product and service offerings that complement the Company’s current biologics workflow solutions.\nTo fulfill a condition to obtaining certain regulatory approvals for the closing of the transaction, on April 30, 2020 the Company\ndivested certain of its existing product lines in the Life Sciences segment for a cash purchase price, net of cash transferred and\ntransaction costs, of $826 million and recognized a pretax gain on sale of $455 million ($305 million after-tax or $0.42 per\ndiluted common share). The divested product lines in the aggregate generated revenues of approximately $170 million in 2019.\nThe divestiture of these product lines did not represent a strategic shift with a major effect on the Company’s operations and\nfinancial results and therefore is not reported as a discontinued operation.\n\nThe Company financed the Cytiva Acquisition with approximately $3.0 billion of proceeds from the 2019 underwritten public\nofferings of its Common Stock and Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“MCPS Series A”), approximately\n\n76\n", "vlm_text": "\nContract assets, liabilities and costs are reported on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets on a contract-by-contract basis. \nNOTE 3.

The LYONs originally carry a yield to maturity of 2.375% (with contingent interest payable as\ndescribed below).

Future resolution of uncertain tax positions related to discontinued operations may result in additional charges or credits to earnings from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings(refertoNote4) \nThe Company operates in various non-U.S. jurisdictions where income tax incentives and rulings have been granted for specific periods of time. In Switzerland, the Company has various tax rulings and tax holiday arrangements which reduce the overall effective tax rate of the Company. The tax holidays expire between 2021 and 2027. In Singapore, the Company operates under various tax incentive agreements that provide for reduced tax rates. Subject to the Company satisfying certain requirements, the agreements expire in 2022. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had satisfied the conditions enumerated in these agreements. Included in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements are tax benefits of  $\\S43$  million,  $\\S71$  million and  $\\S69$  million (or \\$0.06, \\$0.10 and  $\\S0.10$  per diluted common share) for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, from these rulings andtaxholidays. \nNOTE 16. NONOPERATINGINCOME (EXPENSE)\nThe Company disaggregates the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs of noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans and presents the other components of net periodic benefit cost in other income (expense), net. These other components include the assumed rate of return on plan assets, partially offset by amortization of actuarial losses and interest and aggregated to a gain of  $\\S16$  million,  $\\S12$  million and  $\\S35$  million as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company's net periodic pension cost for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a settlement loss of  $\\S7$  million (\\$6 million after tax or  $\\S0.01$   per diluted common share) as a result of the transfer of a portion of its non-U.S. pension liabilities related to one defined benefit plan to a third party. \nThe Company estimates the fair value of investments in equity securities using the Fair Value Alternative and records adjustments to fair value within net earnings. Additionally, the Company is a limited partner in a partnership that invests in early stage companies. While the partnership records these investments at fair value, the Company's investment in the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded net realized and unrealized gains of  $\\S18$  million related to changes in the fair value of these investments. In addition, the Company recorded other income of  $\\S5$  million related to certain other transactions during 2020. These items are reflected in other income (expense), net in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Earnings. No significant realized or unrealized gains or losses were recorded in either 2019 or 2018 with respect to these investments. "}
