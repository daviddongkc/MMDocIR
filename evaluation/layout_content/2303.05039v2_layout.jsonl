We construct datasets separately for these two domains since we want to study whether personality has differ- ent influences on users’ behaviours for different domains. Studies have shown that people with different personalities prefer differ- ent kinds of music [ 11 ]. For example, people with a high degree of openness like to listen to rock music, while neurotic people like jazz. Therefore, we choose  music  as one of the domains to be studied. In order to study the role of personality in different domains, we randomly select  beauty  for comparison.
