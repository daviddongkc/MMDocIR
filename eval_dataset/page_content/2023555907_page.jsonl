In countries\nsuch as Germany and Canada, child protection agencies are contacted to care for the\nunaccompanied minor, and the children are entitled to a legal representative who must take into\naccount the views of the minor. Minors have the right to seek and receive asylum following\ninternational treaties currently in force in Chile. In the EU, unaccompanied minors are entitled to\na legal representative, with fees paid for by the state. In Greece, unaccompanied minors who are\nvictims of human trafficking activity and who are cooperating with the authorities for the\nprosecution of this activity may be given visas on a discretionary basis. In Finland, a legal\nrepresentative is appointed by the district court, but the relationship is severed once the minor\nturns 18 years of age. In France, minors are generally exempt from removal proceedings. In Israel,\nminors must be interviewed in a way that is sensitive to the potential trauma they may have\nexperienced.

EU law\nrequires that children not be housed in prison facilities or co-mingled with adult detainees.\nFurthermore, detention must be as short as possible and only used as a last resort. Brazil bans the\ncollective detention of classes of migrants and will not repatriate minors, a policy also\nimplemented in France. In Germany, minors and families with minors should only be detained\nin exceptional circumstances and without endangering the well-being of the child. Greece\nsimilarly severely limits the detention of minors, restricting it to less than 25 days. Israel allows\ndetention for up to 60 days with an extension permissible if release would harm public health or\nthe security of the state. Italy places children in foster families as an alternative to detention. In\nMalta, unaccompanied minors are not to be held in detention, although, in practice, many are\nheld under the authority of health regulations. In Finland, minors over the age of 15 can be\ndetained, and the state also provides financial assistance to a minor who wishes to return to their\ncountry of origin. In the UK, minors can only be held in immigration detention facilities for a\nmaximum of 24 hours. In Canada, minors can only be held in immigration detention as a last\nresort and must attend school if required by provincial law for persons of their age.\n\nV. Resettlement and Integration Programs\n\nUnaccompanied minors are sometimes eligible for resettlement or integration programs. In\nBrazil, the migration policy provides for such programs and social benefits, public goods,\neducation, comprehensive public legal assistance, work, housing, banking services, and social\nsecurity. According to EU law, once their application has been approved, asylum seekers must\nbe granted access to employment, education, procedures for recognition of qualifications, social\nwelfare, healthcare, and accommodation under the same conditions as nationals. Some states in\nGermany have established special education programs geared toward migrant communities to\naid in their integration. In Greece, some migrants are resettled elsewhere in Europe under an EU\nresettlement program. In France, the law and jurisprudence grant unaccompanied minors access\nto the same programs and services as French citizens. Malta recently launched an integration\nprogram that leads to the issuance of a certificate after 230 hours of instruction. Turkey provides\nchild asylum seekers with basic educational programming, but does not envisage the permanent\nsettlement of refugees on its territory, instead working with the United Nations High\nCommissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) toward the resettlement of asylum seekers. In the UK, local\nauthorities continue to have a duty to support the integration of asylum seekers between 18 and\n21 years of age. Canada restricts the resettlement of unaccompanied minors to those who apply\nin-country rather than from abroad through the UNHCR, unless they have family already present\nin Canada.\n\nVI. Family Reunification\n\nSome jurisdictions provide for family reunification as a right, while others restrict family\nreunification in scope, geography, or at the discretion of the decision maker.

Family reunification must be requested within three months of arrival and is  restricted to first-degree relatives in an ascending line unless there are no such relatives available.  In  Germany , parents of unaccompanied minors who have been granted certain residence titles  must be issued a temporary residence permit to move to that country.  Greece  restricts family  reunification to legal residents and refugee status holders. In  France , unmarried children may  generally request to be joined by their parents and their minor unmarried siblings who are still  dependent on the parents.  UK  law places a duty on the government to trace the family of the  unaccompanied minor with the best interests of the child as a primary, but not sole, priority, but  suggests that reunification does not necessarily have to occur in the UK. In  Canada , minors cannot  apply for family reunification, but the minor’s parents can apply to the minister of Immigration,  Refugees and Citizenship for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.

Unfortunately, while there are some protections in place, as of 2017, there is no integrated  federal strategy on how to deal with separated and unaccompanied child migrants  in Canada.   \nIn 2019, the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), a non-governmental organization, passed a  resolution to  \n1.   Call on the federal government, in collaboration with provincial and territorial  governments and NGOs, to establish a national framework for unaccompanied and  separated migrant, refugee claimant and refugee children.  2.   Insist that Canada’s national framework for unaccompanied and separated migrant,  refugee claimant and refugee children take into account the following:  a.   the development of appropriate legislation, policy, protocols and safeguards to  ensure fair and compassionate treatment of unaccompanied and separated minors  at all stages of their settlement in Canada;  b.   adequate access to services and supports in all areas critical to the minor’s  settlement and wellbeing (including, but not limited to: access to safe housing,  education, healthcare services, legal assistance, social welfare, basic needs  supports and family reunification), and;  c.   that Canada’s national framework for unaccompanied and separated migrant,  refugee claimant and refugee children is developed and implemented in  accordance with the United Nations  Convention on the Rights of the Child  and the  United Nations  Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children .   \nSimilar to child custody cases, the claims of unaccompanied children must be adjudicated with  the best interests of the child as an important factor to be considered. According to the IRCC,  \n[t]he IRPA does not set out specific procedures or criteria for dealing with refugee claims  from children. However, Paragraph 3(3)(f) requires that the IRPA be interpreted and  applied in compliance with international human rights instruments, including  the  Convention on the Rights of the Child .  "}

This document, drafted and signed by the Supreme Court, government  agencies, and international organizations, is currently in force. It guides the first foster  program, further judicial measures, and follow-up obligations adopted to protect  unaccompanied and separated minors by applying domestic legislation and  international human rights treaties.   \nI.  Definition of Unaccompanied and Separated Minor  \nAlthough there is no domestic legislation in Chile that defines an unaccompanied minor, the  Protocol for the Protection of Unaccompanied and Separated Children and Adolescents in the  Context of Migration and/or in Need of International Protection of 2021 (Protocol) explicitly  includes the definition provided by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2005.    \nThus, an unaccompanied migrant minor is understood to be one who “is separated from both  parents and other relatives and is not in the care of an adult who, by law or custom, has such  responsibility.” 2    \nThe Protocol also recognizes the concept of accompanied but separated minors, consisting of  those separated from both parents or their legal or habitual guardians, but not necessarily from  other relatives. Therefore, they may be minors accompanied by other adult members of the  extended family.  3  The Committee on the Rights of the Child also defines this concept.   "}

It was triggered for the first time on March 4, 2022, due to the  mass inflow of persons fleeing Ukraine as a result of Russia’s invasion.  The directive  provides specific rules for unaccompanied minors in article 13, paragraph 4, and article 16. \n\n •   The Qualification Directive provides common grounds to grant international protection in the  EU.  It mentions unaccompanied minors in section 20, paragraph 3 as a vulnerable group.  Article 31 specifically deals with unaccompanied minors. \n\n •   The Asylum Procedures Directive creates a common asylum system in the EU.  Article 25  deals with procedural guarantees for unaccompanied minors. \n\n •   The Reception Conditions Directive establishes common standards of conditions of living for  asylum seekers.  It addresses unaccompanied minors in articles 11, 21, 22, 23, and 24. \n\n •   The Return Directive lays down common standards and procedures for returning illegal  immigrants.  Article 10 focuses on the return and removal of unaccompanied minors,  whereas article 17 deals with detention of minors and families.  \nIn 2016, the European Commission published several proposals to reform the CEAS to address  the problem of unequal burden sharing and to promote solidarity among the Member States.  However, the reforms did not receive the necessary support and are currently on hold.  In 2020,  the European Commission therefore proposed a “New Pact on Migration and Asylum,” which,  among other things, contains several provisions that address the situation of unaccompanied  minors, such as strengthening the guardianship system.    \nII.   Defining Unaccompanied Minors  \nThe Dublin III Regulation of the EU establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the  Member State responsible for examining an asylum application and is directly applicable in the  EU Member States without any implementing national legislation needed. It defines “minor” as  a third-country national or stateless person below the age of 18 and “unaccompanied minor” as  “a minor who arrives on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult  responsible for him or her   whether by law or by the practice of the Member State concerned, and  for as long as he or she is not effectively taken into the care of such a person; it includes a minor  who is left unaccompanied after he or she has entered the territory of the Member States.” 18  Other  EU asylum legislation contains the same definitions.

The Concept of Safe Country of Origin and Safe Third Country\n\nThe Asylum Procedures Directive deals with the concept of safe country of origin and safe third\ncountry and how it influences an asylum application. Member States are authorized to designate\ncertain countries as safe countries of origin.?3 Such a designation must be based “on a range of\nsources of information, including in particular information from other Member States, EASO\n[European Asylum Support Office], UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees],\nthe Council of Europe and other relevant international organisations.”24 According to the annex\nof the Asylum Procedures Directive, “a country is considered as a safe country of origin where,\non the basis of the legal situation, the application of the law within a democratic system and the\ngeneral political circumstances, it can be shown that there is generally and consistently no\n\n18 Dublin III Regulation, art. 2(i) & (j).\n191d. arts. 7-15.\n\n20 Td. art. 13.\n\n21 Td. art. 8, para. 3.\n\n22 Td. art. 8, para. 4.\n\n2 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 37.\n\n24 Td. art. 37, para. 3.\n", "vlm_text": "\nIII.

Return  \nWith regard to the return of minors, the CJEU has opined that when issuing a return decision,  Member States “must . . . take due account of the best interests of the child.” 62  Practices with  regard to returning unaccompanied minors vary from Member State to Member State. A 2019  study from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) found that some Member  States, such as France and Italy, provide unaccompanied minors with a legal right to stay. Others  do not provide them with such a legal right but do not enforce returns in practice.   \nBefore a return decision is issued, minors have a right to be heard. This right stems from the  Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the EU Charter and must be part of the  assessment of the best interests of the child.  The European Commission states in its non-legally  binding Return Handbook that   the measures adopted by Member States to ensure the right to be  heard should be guided by the following key principles:  \n•   expressing views is a choice and not an obligation;   •   the right to be heard should not be subject to any age limits or other arbitrary  restrictions, either in law or in practice;   •   a minor should be heard in an environment that is appropriate to his/her needs;   •   the means used to give effect to the right to be heard should be adapted to the level of  understanding and ability to communicate and should take into account the  circumstances of the case;   •   in full consideration of the need to protect minors from harm, a minor should not be  interviewed more often than necessary;   •   facilitating the expression of views may require special measures for a minor in  particularly vulnerable situations, including the provision of interpretation and  translation services.    \nThe EU Return Directive lays down common standards and procedures for returning illegal  immigrants.  It reiterates the obligation of the Member States to take due account of the best  interests of the child when implementing the directive.  Article 10 focuses on the return and  removal of unaccompanied minors. Member States must ensure that an unaccompanied minor  will be returned to a member of his or her family, a guardian, or an adequate reception facility in  the country of return. Furthermore, before issuing a return decision, assistance by “appropriate  bodies” must be sought, such as legal or medical assistance from a governmental or non- governmental (NGO) guardian system or child protection bodies.  According to the Return  Handbook, providing assistance is more than mere guardianship.    "}

The CRC as well as the Charter of Fundamental  Rights of the European Union (EU Charter) provide that the best interests of the child must be  the primary consideration for all matters regarding children.  The 2013 EU Asylum Procedures  Directive has not yet been transposed into German law, but has direct effect since the deadline  for transposition passed on July 20, 2015.  The EU’s Dublin III Regulation, which contains an  exception for unaccompanied minors with regard to which Member State is in charge of  processing the asylum application, is directly applicable in Germany.  German law must be  interpreted in line with the requirements set out in the EU directives.    "}

The latter is defined as  \na minor who arrives in Greece without being accompanied by a person exercising his/her  parental care in accordance with Greek legislation or by another person to whom it has  been assigned according to the law, but accompanied by an adult relative who in practice  takes care of him/her.   \nIn this report, the term “UAM” will be used to include both categories of minors, unless  otherwise indicated.  \nIII. Restrictions on Claiming Asylum \nArticle 89 of the IPC provides the grounds on which an application for international protection  must be rejected as inadmissible. Rejection on the basis of inadmissibility precludes the  application from being examined for its merits under articles 3-9 of the IPC, which provide the  substantial requirements for a finding of a well-founded fear of prosecution. The existence of a  “first country of asylum” in which the applicant has received international protection or in which  asylum procedures must continue in accordance with EU law, or the existence of another country  that would be considered safe for the applicant (“safe third country”) are considered bases for  inadmissibility. The other two grounds of inadmissibility are the submission of a repeat  application that does not show the existence of any new material elements, and the existence of a  prior application that was made on the applicant’s behalf by a family member.

First Country of Asylum\n\nThe IPC provides that an application for international protection must be found inadmissible if\nthe applicant was already granted international protection by an EU member state, or a third\ncountry that is considered a first country of asylum under the law. The application must be\nconsidered inadmissible also if another EU member state or state bound by EU law has assumed\nresponsibility for examining the international protection application under Regulation (EU)\n604/2013, which governs the allocation among EU member states and states bound by EU law of\nthe responsibility for examining applicants for international protection.\n\nThe IPC defines a “first country of asylum” as follows:\n\nA country shall be considered as the first country of asylum for the applicant on condition\nthat he or she is readmitted to that country if he or she has been recognised as a refugee by\nit and still enjoys the relevant protection or enjoys other adequate protection in that\ncountry, including by benefiting from the principle of non-refoulement.!5\n\nWhile “first country of asylum” is provided as a discrete ground for inadmissibility, the Greek\nCouncil for Refugees (GCR) has reported on the basis of its communication with asylum\nauthorities that it is not used as a stand-alone ground of inadmissibility in practice and that no\napplications were rejected solely on this ground in 2021.14\n\nB. Safe Third Country\n\nThe “safe third country” concept is an important restriction on the availability of international\nprotection because\n\ne itis a ground for inadmissibility and thus may lead to summary rejection of an application\nwithout an examination of specific merits of a claim to well-founded fear to return,\n\ne the government may designate a country generally “safe” without needing to determine\nwhether the country is specifically safe for the applicant (though the applicant has the right\nto object to the application of the determination to his specific case),!5 and\n\n2 TPC art. 89.\n13 TPC art. 90.\n\nM4 Greek Council for Refugees (GCR), AIDA Asylum Information Database Country Report: Greece, 2021 Update\n146-47 (2022), https:/ / perma.cc/W8DJ-XRY3.\n\n5 IPC art. 91(2), (3).\n", "vlm_text": "\nA.

Long-term special accommodation facilities may be operated by  the same types of noncommercial legal entities that can be registered in the System as a GSP. SSPUAM is responsible for the supervision of long-term accommodation facilities, and examining  and deciding accommodation requests that are filed by GSPs for the placement of UAMs under  their guardianship in appropriate accommodation facilities.

Those who cross into Israel without passing through designated borders  (infiltrators) may be sentenced for five years imprisonment, a fine, or both. Infiltrators, however,  may file asylum requests.    \nAccording to a 2011 Knesset report, there were reportedly about 200 unaccompanied minors from  third countries who entered Israel via undesignated border crossings from Egypt in 2010.  By  July 2020, there were reportedly 37,288 persons who infiltrated into Israel from Egypt,   $71\\%$   of  whom were citizens of Eritrea (26,563),   $21\\%$   citizens of Sudan (7,624),   $7\\%$   citizens of other  countries in Africa, and  $1\\%$   citizens of the rest of the world.     \nThe number of infiltrators has drastically declined in recent years following the completion of the  construction of a barrier between Egypt and Israel, which has almost completely prevented  crossing from Egypt into Israel. Consequently, there has been a significant decline in the growth  rate of some of the children’s populations.  A similar barrier along the border with Jordan was  reportedly built in 2016-17.  By 2020, 613 infiltrators had left Israel.   \nIsrael has implemented a number of repatriation programs with regard to infiltrators. According  to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), since 2009, Israel has resettled  over 1,000 refugees, mostly to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands,  New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States. In 2019, there were  289 spots available for refugees to be resettled out of Israel .     "}

Statistics   \nMalta struggled with large number of asylum seekers from 2002,  although the number of  applications received in recent years has dropped substantially. Malta received 4,021 applications  for asylum in 2019. This dropped by almost half in 2020 to 2,419, by half again in 2021, when  Malta received 1,281 applications,  and to 913 in 2022.  The drop in numbers can possibly be  attributed to a “drastic[] decrease” in the Armed Forces of Malta’s sea patrols,  along with a  memorandum of understanding with Libya that aims to strengthen cooperation and combat  human traffickers both on land and at sea.

The Border Force is responsible for  immigration and customs controls at UK ports and airports.  Immigration Enforcement ensures  that immigration laws are complied with, such as the prohibition on working without proper  authorization,  and that individuals who do not have permission to remain in the UK  are removed.

The bill would provide that any  asylum or human rights claims from unaccompanied minors who enter the UK illegally will be  declared inadmissible, as well as from those who travel through safe third countries. They would  not be permitted to settle in the UK and, once removed, would not be allowed to re-enter.  While  the bill would not require the secretary of state to remove unaccompanied children until they  turn 18 years of age, it would empower the secretary of state to reunite them with their parents;  to a designated safe country where the person is either a national or has a passport or other  identity document.  The secretary of state would have discretion to introduce regulations  specifying other circumstances under which unaccompanied minors could be removed, and for  how long they could be detained before their removal.  During the time unaccompanied minors  who entered the country without lawful permission are in the UK before they turn 18 and are  removed, the bill provides that, where necessary, the secretary of state would be responsible for  providing, or arranging, accommodation and appropriate support for them prior to any transfer  to a local authority. Local authorities could also transfer the unaccompanied minors back to the  care of the secretary of state. Once removed under the provisions of the bill, the unaccompanied  minor would not be allowed to re-enter the UK.  "}

Guidance from the Home Office notes that,   \n[a]s a general principle, even where one of the statutory powers to detain is available in a particular case, unaccompanied children must not be detained other than in the very exceptional circumstances specified in paragraph 18B of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act "}
