Since large corporations employ a vast quantum of societal resources, ITC believes that the governance process should ensure that these resources are utilised in a manner that meets stakeholders’ aspirations and societal expectations.

The average growth rate over the past\nfour years stands at 8.6%, making it the fastest pace\nof growth in India’s history. While all three sectors\nof the economy recorded positive growth during\n2006/07, the key driver was the industrial sector,\nwhich grew by an estimated 10%. Industrial growth\nwas led by the manufacturing sector, which recorded\nan impressive increase of 11.3% bolstered by capital\ngoods production, which grew by 17.7% over the\nprevious year. The strong showing of the capital\ngoods sector reflects the continuing momentum of\nthe investment cycle. The Services sector posted a\nrobust growth of 11.2% in line with the strong\nperformance trend of the previous years. Agriculture\nsector recorded a relatively low growth of 2.7%.\n\nThe value of India’s merchandise exports grew\nby 20.8% to touch USD 124.6 billion during the\nyear. Exports clocked an impressive 21.6% growth\nfor the first 8 months of the year but lost momentum\nthereafter due to a slowdown in the US economy\nand the appreciation of the Indian Rupee.\nIndia’s trade deficit widened further to touch\nUSD 56.7 billion, an increase of 40.6% over\n2005/06, mainly on account of a sharp increase in\nthe value of oil imports. However, net invisibles\nsurplus on account of buoyant service exports helped\nameliorate the impact on the current account. The\noverall position on external balances remains strong\nwith foreign exchange reserves increasing by\nUSD 47 billion during the year. The strong overall\neconomic performance during the year was however\naccompanied by rising inflation. Several policy\nmeasures were announced in response, aimed at\ncurtailing liquidity and improving supply side\nconditions. These included the increase in the repo\nrate and cash reserve ratio, duty free imports of\nwheat and pulses, and reduction in import duties\non non-ferrous metals, cement, capital goods etc.\n\nThe strong investment momentum and high\nlevels of business confidence justify the double-digit\nGDP growth aspirations set in the 11th Plan.\n\n@\n\nHigh levels of economic growth are essential to\nrealise the oft quoted demographic dividend through\nthe creation of employment opportunities for the\n9 to 10 million people expected to enter the job\nmarket annually, the majority of whom would be\nfrom rural India. However, economic growth does\nnot necessarily translate to sustainable development.\nThe manner of industrial growth so far has taken\nan immeasurable toll of finite natural resources, and\nyet left vast numbers of people in poverty. On the\none hand, depletion of biodiversity resources — soil,\nwater, air — has considerably increased the fragility\nof ecological balance. On the other hand, the\ndeclining rate of growth of agriculture has led to\nthe present situation where nearly 60% of India’s\npopulation shares less than 20% of its output. These\ndichotomies can be eliminated only if the challenges\nof inclusive growth, national competitiveness and\nenvironmental sustainability are addressed in an\nintegrated fashion.\n\nOver 75% of those below the poverty line reside\nin rural India. A comprehensive growth strategy for\nrural India, including the agricultural sector, is\nnecessary to address the serious issues relating to\nsustainability and to enlarge effective domestic\ndemand. Empowerment of the rural population has\ntherefore assumed centrality in policy focus. Time\nbound programmes, such as Bharat Nirman,\nNational Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme,\nSarva Shiksha Abhiyan etc., and the emphasis on\nphysical outcomes rather than on mere financial\noutlays, have the potential to contribute significantly\nto economic capacity creation at the grassroots and\nto create the right sentiment for enlarged\nparticipation of private entrepreneurship in the\neconomic advancement of rural India.\n\nIn this context, your Company’s pioneering\ne-Choupal initiative is a powerful illustration of\nlinking business purpose with a larger societal cause.\nThe e-Choupal leverages the power of the Internet\nto empower the small and marginal farmer with a\nhost of services related to know-how, best practices,\ntimely and relevant weather information, transparent\ndiscovery of prices and much more. This digital\ninfrastructure is also increasingly being used for\nchannelising services related to credit and insurance\nand can be extended to areas such as health,\n", "vlm_text": "REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS & Management Discussion and Analysis \nFor the Financial Year Ended 31st March, 2007 Your Directors submit their Report for the financial year ended 31st March, 2007. \n\nSOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT \nAdvance estimates of the Central Statistical Organisation indicate a real GDP growth of   $9.2\\%$  for 2006/07.

India’s trade deficit widened further to touch USD 56.7 billion, an increase of   $40.6\\%$   over 2005/06, mainly on account of a sharp increase in the value of oil imports. However, net invisibles surplus on account of buoyant service exports helped ameliorate the impact on the current account. The overall position on external balances remains strong with foreign exchange reserves increasing by USD 47 billion during the year. The strong overall economic performance during the year was however accompanied by rising inflation. Several policy measures were announced in response, aimed at curtailing liquidity and improving supply side conditions. These included the increase in the repo rate and cash reserve ratio, duty free imports of wheat and pulses, and reduction in import duties on non-ferrous metals, cement, capital goods etc. \nThe strong investment momentum and high levels of business confidence justify the double-digit GDP growth aspirations set in the 11th Plan. \nHigh levels of economic growth are essential to realise the oft quoted demographic dividend through the creation of employment opportunities for the 9 to 10 million people expected to enter the job market annually, the majority of whom would be from rural India. However, economic growth does not necessarily translate to sustainable development. The manner of industrial growth so far has taken an immeasurable toll of finite natural resources, and yet left vast numbers of people in poverty. On the one hand, depletion of biodiversity resources – soil, water, air – has considerably increased the fragility of ecological balance. On the other hand, the declining rate of growth of agriculture has led to the present situation where nearly   $60\\%$   of India’s population shares less than  $20\\%$   of its output. These dichotomies can be eliminated only if the challenges of inclusive growth, national competitiveness and environmental sustainability are addressed in an integrated fashion. \nOver   $75\\%$   of those below the poverty line reside in rural India. A comprehensive growth strategy for rural India, including the agricultural sector, is necessary to address the serious issues relating to sustainability and to enlarge effective domestic demand. Empowerment of the rural population has therefore assumed centrality in policy focus. Time bound programmes, such as Bharat Nirman, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan etc., and the emphasis on physical outcomes rather than on mere financial outlays, have the potential to contribute significantly to economic capacity creation at the grassroots and to create the right sentiment for enlarged participation of private entrepreneurship in the economic advancement of rural India. \nIn this context, your Company’s pioneering e-Choupal initiative is a powerful illustration of linking business purpose with a larger societal cause. The e-Choupal leverages the power of the Internet to empower the small and marginal farmer with a host of services related to know-how, best practices, timely and relevant weather information, transparent discovery of prices and much more.

It is apprehended that the\ntax arbitrage opportunity, which is already\nextremely attractive, will now be enhanced by the\nimposition of VAT, encouraging an even greater\nlevel of smuggling of cigarettes into India.\nSmuggled international brands already account\nfor about 7% of the market and cost the exchequer\napproximately Rs.2000 crores by way of foregone\ntaxes and foreign exchange outflow. This is bound\nto increase.\n\nThe scales are heavily tilted against the domestic\ncigarette industry on the regulatory front also. The\nprovisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco\nProducts (Prohibition of Advertisement and\nRegulation of Trade and Commerce, Production,\nSupply and Distribution) Act, 2003, (COTPA),\nrequire that the packages of all tobacco products\nmanufactured in the country must bear pictorial\nhealth warnings. Since the bulk of tobacco\nproducts, apart from cigarettes, are manufactured\nin the unorganised sector, the provisions of COTPA\nwill, in effect, apply mainly to domestic cigarette\nmanufacture.

It is apprehended that the tax arbitrage opportunity, which is already extremely attractive, will now be enhanced by the imposition of VAT, encouraging an even greater level of smuggling of cigarettes into India. Smuggled international brands already account for about  $7\\%$   of the market and cost the exchequer approximately Rs.2000 crores by way of foregone taxes and foreign exchange outflow. This is bound to increase. \nThe scales are heavily tilted against the domestic cigarette industry on the regulatory front also. The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, (COTPA), require that the packages of all tobacco products manufactured in the country must bear pictorial health warnings. Since the bulk of tobacco products, apart from cigarettes, are manufactured in the unorganised sector, the provisions of COTPA will, in effect, apply mainly to domestic cigarette manufacture. While smuggled stocks will, in any case, not bear such warnings, most other tobacco products could also escape these stringent legislative requirements.
