This trend poses major  challenges for global healthcare systems, both in developed and  in emerging and developing economies.

The second trend is economic development in  emerging countries, which is improving access to healthcare for  many people. Significant investments will persist, driving overall  demand for healthcare products and services and hence market  growth. The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a  consequence of an aging population, and of environmental and  lifestyle-related changes. This trend results in far more patients  with multiple morbidities, putting further pressure on health- care systems and leading to higher costs; it also increases the  need for new, more timely ways to detect and treat disease. The  fourth global trend with a significant impact on our business de- velopment is the transformation of healthcare providers, which  stems from a combination of societal and market forces driving  healthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses  differently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector  is prompting the introduction of new remuneration models  for healthcare services, such as value-based, rather than fee- for-service, reimbursement. Digitalization and AI are likely to  become key enablers for healthcare providers as the latter in- creasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience,  with better outcomes and a general reduction in the cost of  care. This trend is driven partly by society’s increasing resistance  to healthcare costs, the growing professional iz ation of paying  entities, burdens from chronic disease, rapid scientific progress  and staff shortages. In response to these factors, healthcare  providers are consolidating into networked structures, resulting  in larger, often international, clinic and laboratory chains that  increasingly act like large corporations.

Faster  growth of new incidences in low- and middle-income coun- tries, which lack adequate infrastructure and human capital to  address this growing cancer burden, is accelerating demand  for radiation therapy as a cost-effective, high-quality cancer  care modality. Technological advancements with optimized  and automated clinical tools to improve accuracy in radio- therapy and radiosurgery continue to drive global demand for  new devices with digital solutions and applications to treat a  broader range of cases, reduce treatment time, and increase  patient throughput. The shortage of trained clinical personnel  in emerging markets, combined with a focus on operational  efficiencies and cost reduction in developed markets, are dri­ ving demand for more automated products and services that  can be integrated into clinical workflows to make treatments  more rapid and cost-effective. The radiotherapy and radiosur- gery markets are highly consolidated and served mainly by  Siemens ­ Healthineers, Elekta AB and Accuray Inc.

The time horizon covered by ERM  is typically three years. Our ERM is based on a net approach,  addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the existing  control meas­ ures have been taken. If risks have already been  considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the financial state- ments (for example as a provision or risk contingency), they  are be incorporated, along with their financial impact, in the  entity’s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional  risks arising from the same subject (for example deviations from  business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be  considered for the ERM. In order to provide a comprehensive  view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are  identified in a structured procedure. This combines elements  of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. While reporting  generally follows a quarterly cycle, this regular reporting process  is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to  escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and op- portunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, con- sidering different perspectives, including business objectives,  reputation and regulatory matters. The bottom-up identifica- tion and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops  with the respective managements of the ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  businesses and regional levels. This top-down element ensures  that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the  management level and are included in the subsequent reporting  process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportu- nities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and  are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels  mentioned above.

{"layout": 265, "type": "text", "text": "Our business strategy includes amongst others the acquisition of  companies and business activities that expand or complement  our existing business such as the acquisition of Varian Medical  Systems, Inc. Successful growth through acquisitions is depen- dent upon our ability to identify suitable acquisition targets,  conduct appropriate due diligence, negotiate transactions at  favorable terms and ultimately complete such transactions as  well as integrate the acquired companies successfully. Mergers  and acquisitions (M&A) are generally associated with risks due  to the difficulties that may arise when integrating people, oper- ations, technologies and products. Non-compliance with closing  conditions or denial of necessary regulatory approvals could  adversely affect the strategic planning and result in additional  costs. Our assessments and assumptions regarding acquisition  targets may not prove to be correct and actual developments  may differ significantly from our expectations. This could mean  that the expected synergies such as cost savings may not be fully  realized. Acquired companies may also have unexpected or pre- viously unidentified liabilities or pending regulatory litigation.  This could result in additional costs and negative effects on our  business. There is no guarantee that any of the acquired com- panies can be integrated successfully and within the planned  time frame. It is possible that the intended combination of com- panies, processes and employees will be more complex than  expected. If we cannot successfully integrate newly acquired  companies into our existing operations, for example in terms  of regulatory compliance, information technology and finance,  additional expenses, delays and difficulties could arise. The same  applies for the integration of corporate cultures. If we do not  succeed in integrating these and retaining employees, we risk  losing employees in key roles. This could have a negative impact  on our know-how and our ability to innovate as well as on our  cooperation with customers. Furthermore, acquisitions could  cause an increased and unsustainable workload for employees  as well as a lack of employee engagement and well-being, which  could result in higher staff turnover rates and instability. An  acquisition could also lead to the loss of customers, suppliers,  partners, licensors or contacts to other stakeholders. In addition,  unforeseen acquisition, administrative, tax and other expendi- tures may incur in connection with these transactions, including  costs related to integration of acquired businesses. Should the  business performance of the acquired company be below our  expectations on a lasting basis, this could lead to impairment  losses, in particular on goodwill and intangible assets which  could adversely affect our net assets and results of operations.  We counter these risks by carefully selecting the companies to  be acquired and by conducting a thorough due diligence. We  also create detailed integration plans, set up integration projects  and strive to implement them in a way that countermeas­ ures  can be initiated in a timely manner. Moreover, we support the  integration of corporate cultures and change management by  providing clarity about organizational structures to employees  and developing and executing clear communication plans.

Global or regional economic and  geopolitical instability as well as continuing uncertainties and  challenging conditions in regional markets may have a negative  impact on our business. Future developments globally depend  on a number of political and economic factors that we cannot  fully anticipate. There is a risk that an unstable political, regula- tory and economic environment in certain countries might po- tentially result in significant adverse business impacts including  non-sustainable business development, diverted management  attention or less competitive strength. If global macroeconomic  growth stalls and we cannot successfully adapt our production  and cost structure to subsequent changes in the markets we op- erate in, it cannot be ruled out that we will experience adverse  effects. In addition, the prices for our products, solutions and  services may decline as a result of unfavorable market condi- tions to a greater extent than we currently anticipate. Moreover,  there is an increase in governmental protectionism in recent  years, for example in the form of import and export controls,  tariffs and other trade barriers. Protectionist trade policies and  changes in the political and regulatory environment in our  markets could expose us to penalties and sanctions and could  negatively affect our business in national markets. Furthermore,  the imposition of import customs duties, increased regulatory  burdens, and non-refundable taxes on foreign value added  could result in a reduction of our profit, if passing these costs  along to customers is not feasible. Other protectionist meas­ ures such as the imposition of localization requirements or local  ownership and shareholder regulations could adversely affect  our business volume and market share as well as worsen our  competitive position in bidding processes. Moreover, the United  States and China are important markets, and the trade conflict  between the two countries burdens our relevant business. This  also brings, in addition to punitive tariffs, the risk of threats  to free market access. Additional governmental influences and  regulations in key geographies, such as China’s five-year plans,  could negatively affect our development in such countries and  result in a loss of market share. Further risks stem from geo- political tensions (such as in Iran, Syria, Russia, North Korea,  Afghanistan and Ukraine) and the conflicts which may poten- tially arise. To counter these risks and identify critical cases,  we constantly monitor economic, political and geopolitical  developments and their indicators. Based on this we adapt our  processes and business model to possible changes arising from  protectionism, ensure compliance with all legal requirements  and educate the organization about these changes. We also use  opportunities to engage in discussions with local authorities.

Market demand is also  subject to change, partly due to rapid and significant changes  resulting from the introduction of innovative and disruptive  technologies. New competition in the form of medical tech- nology companies in the low-price segment or niche markets,  as well as independent service organizations, or global players  that want to expand their business with new portfolio elements  or introduce new business models, might lead to increased  pressure on prices or a loss of market share.

As an example, ransomware attacks against  healthcare providers lead to major negative impacts on the  provision of healthcare services and continue to be a significant  risk to healthcare providers, threatening both patient treatment  and security of sensitive patient data. There are increasingly,  large volumes of information, including patient data, being gen- erated that need to be securely processed and stored by the  healthcare organizations involved.

Attacks experienced against ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers, however,  have not changed significantly in number and criticality. We  place a strong focus on cybersecurity to protect our customers,  their patients, and ourselves from cyberattacks. Therefore, we  have established a global cybersecurity organization engaging  all relevant areas of our company and integrates cybersecurity  resources, expertise, and competence in a central team. It is  set up as an enabler and responsible for cybersecurity strategy,  governance, and assurance. In December 2020, as a result of  our strategy and the effectiveness of our meas­ ures, we received  ISO 27001 and 27701 certifications covering our global gover- nance and assurance. In addition to our established technical  and organizational controls, we continuously strengthen the  awareness of our employees so they can detect attacks at an  early stage and react to them in an improved manner. This is  particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to  the high number of employees working remotely on an ongoing  basis. Because cybersecurity is a shared responsibility across  all involved parties and various stakeholders, we are also con- tinually developing our ability to preventively protect our cus- tomers from cyber-attacks as well as responsively support them  when they occur. Furthermore, we enable business continuity  through our cyber resilience. Therefore, we continue to focus  on expanding, adapting and improving established security  controls across the organization and the supply chain.

In addition, we rely upon the supplies of certain  raw materials. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of  these raw materials have been volatile recently, and we expect  that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Changes in  customer demand and market fluctuations for critical parts and  components such as semiconductors might lead to difficulties  in meeting our quality requirements while also purchasing  in sufficient quantities at competitive market prices. Delays,  restrictions, shortages or unavailability of supplies could lead  to unanticipated price increases and could constrain our pro- duction of affected products which could in turn reduce our  profit margins or otherwise adversely affect our performance.  If we are not able to offset increased prices for certain materi- als and components, reduce reliance on them, or find suitable  alternatives, this could result in additional costs and affect our  customer relationships. Some of the components included in  our products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers or  from a sole-source supplier. We are also dependent on our own  production and distribution sites. If a supplier’s operations are  disrupted, we lose a critical supplier, or if one of them no longer  meets performance or quality specifications, we may be re- quired to obtain and qualify one or more replacement suppliers.

Consequently, adverse effects on sub- sidiaries or indirect investments may lead to an impairment of  the investment in subsidiaries in ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG’s  annual financial statements. Impairments would reduce the  net income that can be distributed to owners.

The amount is influenced by, for example, the market  launch of new goods and services, the successful integration  of acquisitions, volatility of capital markets, interest rate de- velopments, exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on  economic trends. At ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers, the recoverable  amount is generally determined based on the fair value less  costs of disposal. For the purpose of estimating a segment’s  fair value less costs of disposal, cash flows are projected for the  next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on  past experience, actual operating results and management’s  best estimate about future developments as well as on market  assumptions. Cash flows after the detailed planning period are  extrapolated using individual growth rates. The determined fair  value of a segment is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierar- chy. Key assumptions on which the determinations of fair val- ues less costs of disposal are based include estimated terminal  value growth rates and discount rates. Both assumptions are  determined individually for each segment. The discount rates  correspond to the segment’s weighted average cost of capi- tal and are calculated based on a risk-free interest rate and a  market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the  current market assessment of the risks specific to each seg- ment by taking into account specific peer group information  on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt. The parameters for  calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of  information. The peer groups undergo an annual review and  are adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates consider  external macroeconomic data and industry-specific trends. The  accounting estimates, including the methodology applied, can  have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately  the amount of any goodwill impairment. Additionally, the out- come of goodwill impairment tests may depend on the alloca- tion of goodwill to the segments.

In   addition ,  the   value   of   the   contingency   element   was   taken   into   account ,  which   depended   on   expectations   about   the   occurrence   and   the   timing   of   the   closing   (level   3).   Upon   closing   of   the   acquisition ,  the   deal   contingent   forward   was   settled   and   hedge   accounting   was   discontinued.
