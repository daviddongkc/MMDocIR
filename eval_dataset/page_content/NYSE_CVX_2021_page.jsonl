Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most\nsignificant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined\nin global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost\ncomponent of refined products.

These policies, some of which support the global net\nzero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand\ngrowth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of these policies can be\ndependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing\nauthorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet\nsustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and\nevolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals.

{"page": 32, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_CVX_2021_32.jpg", "ocr_text": "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to\ntaking actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the need for energy that\nsupports society. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues\ninto its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they\nare applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These\nforecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel\npenetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of\nexpenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional\ninvestments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with\ncertainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted or customer and consumer\npreference in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions.

The company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other\nthings, partnerships with multiple stakeholders, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government\npolicy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability of cost-effective,\nverifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n\n2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets These metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect\nemissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted\n2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:\n\n« 40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of\noil-equivalent (CO2¢/boe),\n\n* 26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg COe/boe,\n« 53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO,e/boe, and\n* 66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO:e/boe.\n\nThe company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris\nAgreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris\nAgreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its\nnet zero aspiration.\n\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target The company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a\nmeasure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the\ncompany’s Upstream and Downstream business and includes Scope | (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from\nimported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The\ncompany’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five\npercent reduction from 2016.\n\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028 The company increased its planned capital spend to approximately\n$10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon\nintensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable\nfuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets.

Proved reserves include both\ndeveloped and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through\nexisting wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be\nrecovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is\nrequired for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include\nfield performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs.\n\nThe estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and\nto the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets.

Amortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production\n(UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP\nbasis using total proved reserves. During 2021, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization\n(DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $13.7 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2021\nwere 6.9 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP\ncalculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP\nDD&A in 2021 would have increased by approximately $700 million.\n\n2.

Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health\ncare and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the\nassumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is\nincluded in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from\nestimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.\n\nFor 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0\npercent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was\n11.2 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan.\nAdditionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or\nexceeded 6.5 percent during each year.\n\nTotal pension expense for 2021 was $1.2 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the\ndiscount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to\nthe long-term rate of return assumption, a | percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension\nplan, which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan\nexpense for 2021 by approximately $81 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have\nreduced pension expense for 2021 by approximately $357 million.\n\nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately $3.4 billion. An\nincrease in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December\n31, 2021, the company used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As\nan indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount\nrate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide\npension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $425 million, and would have decreased the\nplan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.2 billion to $800 million.\n\nFor the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was $85 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021,\nwas $2.5 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a\ndiscount rate for interest cost of 1.6 percent to measure expense in 2021, and a 2.8 percent discount rate to measure the\nbenefit obligations at December 31, 2021. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis,\nresulted in an immaterial impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021.\n\nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual\nexperience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on\nthe $5.1 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2021. In addition, information\nrelated to company contributions is included on page 91 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash\nContributions and Benefit Payments.”\n\nContingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax\nmatters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For\nexample, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws,\nopinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are\nsubject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional\ninformation on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.\n\nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the\nloss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.

For further information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material\n\nChevron Corporation 2021 Annual Report\n52\n", "vlm_text": "\nFor 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0  percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was  11.2 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan.  Additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or  exceeded 6.5 percent during each year. \nTotal pension expense for 2021 was   $\\S1.2$   billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the  discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to  the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension  plan, which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan  expense for 2021 by approximately \\$81 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have  reduced pension expense for 2021 by approximately   $\\S357$   million.  \nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately \\$3.4 billion. An  increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December  31, 2021, the company used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As  an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount  rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide  pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately  $\\S425$   million, and would have decreased the  plan’s underfunded status from approximately   $\\S1.2$   billion to  $\\S800$   million.  \nFor the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was  $\\S85$   million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021,  was  $\\S2.5$   billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a  discount rate for interest cost of 1.6 percent to measure expense in 2021, and a 2.8 percent discount rate to measure the  benefit obligations at December 31, 2021. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis,  resulted in an immaterial impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021. \nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual  experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on  the   $\\S5.1$   billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2021. In addition, information  related to company contributions is included on page 91 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the heading “Cash  Contributions and Benefit Payments.”  \nContingent Losses  Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax  matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For  example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws,  opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are  subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional  information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.  \nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the  loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling,  general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for  income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than  not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax  uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. Refer also to the  business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain  litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2021.  \nAn estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these  liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying  assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates  of such loss.

When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying\nvalue of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In\nmaking the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the\nduration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its\ninvestment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The\nnew cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\n\nDifferences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the\naffiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the\nvarious factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is\nadjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.\n\nNoncontrolling Interests Ownership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are\npresented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income\nattributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome and Consolidated Statement of Equity.

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level | that are directly or indirectly observable for the\nasset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\nDerivatives The majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the\nfinancial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value\nor cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their\nlimited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in\ncurrent income.

Future amounts are not discounted.\nRecoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.\n\nCurrency Translation The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated\noperations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are\nincluded in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and\naffiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the\nConsolidated Statement of Equity.\n\nRevenue Recognition The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical\nproducts as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which\nypically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within\n30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance\nobligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is\nrecognized.\n\nRevenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the\ncustomer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include\ndiscounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price\nincluded in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.\n\nDiscounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain\nmultiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The\ncompany includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable\nin subsequent periods.\n\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation The company issues stock options and other share-based\ncompensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant\ndate fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement\nvalue. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn\nhe award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the\naward at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation\nrights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third\nanniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of\nhe three-year performance period. For awards granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and\nstock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or\nafter the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award\nwill vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant\n‘0 the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.\n\nChevron Corporation 2021 Annual Report\n65\n", "vlm_text": "\nGoodwill  Goodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization.

Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.  \nCurrency Translation  The U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated  operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are  included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and  affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the  Consolidated Statement of Equity.  \nRevenue Recognition  The company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical  products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which  typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer. Payment is generally due within  30 days of delivery. The company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance  obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is  recognized.  \nRevenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the  customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include  discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price  included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.  \nDiscounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain  multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The  company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable  in subsequent periods.  \nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation   The company issues stock options and other share-based  compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant  date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement  value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn  the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the  award at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation  rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third  anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of  the three-year performance period. For awards granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and  stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or  after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award  will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant  to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis. "}

The carrying\nvalue of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models.\nCash flows were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and\na discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.\n\nAssets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-\nUS. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days\nor less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $5,640 and $5,596 at\nDecember 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The company applies\ncash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk\nassociated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial\nposition, results of operations or liquidity.

The carrying  value of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models.  Cash flows were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and  a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. \nAssets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value  The company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non- U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of 90 days  or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of   $\\S5{,}640$   and   $\\S5{,}596$   at  December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.

The company applies  cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk  associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial  position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations,  financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities. \nThe company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic  platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

After termination of the consortium and a third-party\nenvironmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s\nremediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the\nremediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging\nenvironmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In\nFebruary 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately $9,500 plus additional punitive damages.\nAn appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive\ndamages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $9,500. Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final\nappeal in July 2018.\n\nIn February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\n(RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery,\nand corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States\nor profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court\ndenied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to\nhave the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and\nenforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against\nEcuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague,\nunder the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that\nthe Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was\nprocured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates\ninternational public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered\nEcuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries\nresulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador\nowes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the\nTribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is\nfraudulent.

After termination of the consortium and a third-party  environmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s  remediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a three-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the  remediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging  environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In  February 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately  $\\S9{,}500$   plus additional punitive damages.  An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive  damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately  $\\S9{,}500$  . Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final  appeal in July 2018.  \nIn February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District  Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations  (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery,  and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States  or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court  denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to  have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and  enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against  Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague,  under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that  the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was  procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates  international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered  Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries  resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador  owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the  Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is  fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a  separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of  the United States Trade Representative in July 2020. Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is  illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced. "}

It includes three rows detailing specific financial items:\n\n1. \"Deferred charges and other assets\" is shown with values of $(5,659) for 2021 and $(5,286) for 2020.\n2. \"Noncurrent deferred income taxes\" is listed with values of $14,665 for 2021 and $12,569 for 2020.\n3. The \"Total deferred income taxes, net\" is calculated as $9,006 for 2021 and $7,283 for 2020.\n\nThese figures represent deferred financial items, possibly from a financial report or balance sheet, showing how they change from one year to the next.\nIncome taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be  reinvested indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax  liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes. \nU.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been  or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates  for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately   $\\mathbb{S}49{,}200$   at  December 31, 2021. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It  is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of  earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional  taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested. \nUncertain Income Tax Positions  The company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax  position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50  percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in  the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be  taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or  annual periods.  \nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31,  2021, 2020 and 2019. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the  differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in  the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.  \nThe table shows a financial reconciliation for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019. Here's a breakdown:\n\n- **Balance at January 1**: The starting amounts for each year are $5,018 (2021), $4,987 (2020), and $5,070 (2019).\n- **Foreign currency effects**: Adjustments due to currency changes are (-$1) for 2021, $2 for 2020, and $1 for 2019.\n- **Additions based on tax positions taken in current year**: $194 for 2021, $253 for 2020, and $94 for 2019.\n- **Additions for tax positions taken in prior years**: $218 for 2021, $437 for 2020, and $313 for 2019.\n- **Reductions for tax positions taken in prior years**: (-$36) for 2021, (-$216) for 2020, and (-$194) for 2019.\n- **Settlements with taxing authorities in current year**: (-$18) for 2021, (-$429) for 2020, and (-$78) for 2019.\n- **Reductions as a result of a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations**: (-$87) for 2021, (-$16) for 2020, and (-$219) for 2019.\n- **Balance at December 31**: The ending balances are $5,288 for 2021, $5,018 for 2020, and $4,987 for 2019.\nApproximately 82 percent of the   $\\mathbb{S}5{,}288$   of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, would have an impact on the  effective tax rate if subsequently recognized.

The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding  requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and  investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.  \nThe company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as  life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees  share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for  retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than 4 percent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the  company.  \nThe company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an  asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites,  including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants,  marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites. \nAlthough the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is  likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully  determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of  the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible  parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties.

No significant AROs associated  with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates  for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO.

It details the changes and activities within that year which contribute to the total reserves. Here is a breakdown of the table contents:\n\n1. **Quantity at January 1:** 3,404 million BOE\n2. **Revisions:** 131 million BOE\n3. **Improved recovery:** 9 million BOE\n4. **Extension and discoveries:** 658 million BOE\n5. **Purchases:** 36 million BOE\n6. **Sales:** (7) million BOE (indicating a reduction)\n7. **Transfers to proved developed:** (371) million BOE (indicating a transfer out)\n8. **Quantity at December 31:** 3,860 million BOE\n\nThis progression reflects the net changes in the reserves from the beginning to the end of 2021, accounting for additions from discoveries, purchases, and revisions, as well as deductions for sales and transfers to proved developed reserves.\nIn 2021, revisions include an increase of 202 million BOE in Australia, primarily from the approval of the Jansz Io  Compression project (Gorgon and Jansz Io make up the Gorgon Project). In the United States, there was a net increase of  192 million BOE primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins, where 105 million BOE was attributed to improved  commodity price environment, and performance revisions, and 91 million BOE associated with the Anchor Project in the  Gulf of Mexico due to improved commodity price. In Bangladesh, there was an increase of 30 million BOE, primarily from  the approval of the Bibiyana Optimization Project and entitlement effects. These increases were partially offset by a  decrease of 339 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, which includes entitlement effects, changes in field  operating assumptions, reservoir model changes and changes to the FGP/WPMP schedule.

These increases were partially offset by a\ndecrease of 339 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, which includes entitlement effects, changes in field\noperating assumptions, reservoir model changes and changes to the FGP/WPMP schedule.\n\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries of 630 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to the increase of activity\nand planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland and Delaware basins.\n\nThe difference in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 149 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of\n807 million BOE as reflected on pages 105 to 107 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 658 million BOE,\nis primarily due to proved Extensions and Discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior\nyear and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2021.\n\nurchases of 36 million BOE in 2021 are from the acquisition of various properties in the Midland and Delaware basins in\nhe United States.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2021 include 245 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland,\nDelaware and DJ basin developments and 125 million BOE in Equatorial Guinea, Canada, and other international\nlocations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2021, investments totaling approximately $6.6 billion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in\nnon-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The\nUnited States accounted for about $2.8 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and\nDelaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $2.5 billion,\nprimarily related to development projects of TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional $0.4 billion were spent on development\nactivities in Australia. In Africa, about $0.4 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects\nin Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were\nprimarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project\ndevelopment and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and\nremote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects\n\nhat are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2021, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained\nundeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track\nrecord of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or\nmore related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved\nundeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa,\napproximately 200 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at\nvarious fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 950\nmillion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years\nor more. Approximately 800 million BOE are related to TCO in Kazakhstan and about 100 million BOE are related to\nAngola LNG.

In 2021,\nimprovements in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved\nreserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities\nhave been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves\nsections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31\npercent and 35 percent.\n\nProved Reserve Quantities For the three years ending December 31, 2021, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the\nfollowing tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add\nproved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in\ngovernment permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints,\ngeopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.\n\nChevron Corporation 2021 Annual Report\n103\n", "vlm_text": "\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries of 630 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to the increase of activity  and planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland and Delaware basins. \nThe difference in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 149 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of  807 million BOE as reflected on pages 105 to 107 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 658 million BOE,  is primarily due to proved Extensions and Discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior  year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2021.  \nPurchases of 36 million BOE in 2021 are from the acquisition of various properties in the Midland and Delaware basins in  the United States.  \nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2021 include 245 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland,  Delaware and DJ basin developments and 125 million BOE in Equatorial Guinea, Canada, and other international  locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.  \nDuring 2021, investments totaling approximately   $\\S6.6$    billion in oil and gas producing activities and about   $\\S0.1$   billion in  non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The  United States accounted for about   $\\S2.8$   billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and  Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately   $\\S2.5$   billion,  primarily related to development projects of TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional \\$0.4 billion were spent on development  activities in Australia. In Africa, about   $\\S0.4$   billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects  in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were  primarily responsible for about  $\\S0.5$   billion of expenditures.  \nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project  development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and  remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects  that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels. \nAt year-end 2021, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained  undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track  record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or  more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved  undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa,  approximately 200 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at  various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria.

Net production is the company’s share of total production after  deducting both royalties paid to landowners and a government’s  agreed-upon share of production under a PSC. Liquids production  refers to crude oil, condensate, NGLs and synthetic oil volumes.  Oil-equivalent production is the sum of the barrels of liquids and the  oil-equivalent barrels of natural gas produced. See barrels of oil- equivalent, oil-equivalent gas and production-sharing contract. "}
