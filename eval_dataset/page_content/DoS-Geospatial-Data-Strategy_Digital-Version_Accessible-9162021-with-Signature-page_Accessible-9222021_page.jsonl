This serves as a logical framework  that links GDS goals and objectives with the aforementioned guiding documents in Section 1.1 \n\n (“Overview”) and in certain cases cross-walked with relevant strategies listed in Appendix B \n\n (“Crosswalk Tables”).  \nGeospatial Data Strategy Goals and Objectives  \nStrategic Goal 1: Increase geospatial data sharing and accessibility  \nFor the Department’s workforce to realize the full potential value of geospatial data, it must be  able to securely and easily access (i.e., retrieve, modify, copy, transmit, etc.) geospatial data from  within its IT systems and be empowered to share and collaborate as approved and authenticated  by the organization.  By enabling the Department’s geospatial data with matured platforms,  technologies, standards, and operational guidance, the global workforce can better manage its  geospatial data to support the Department’s missions more reliably, faster, and with higher  quality analytical products.  The following four objectives from Strategic Goal 1 are fundamental  to increasing data sharing and accessibility across the Department and among broader geospatial  communities.    \nObjective 1A: Improve geospatial data discovery and collaboration  across internal and external geospatial catalogs and platforms  \nThe Department currently employs various software platforms and network domains to drive  data discovery and collaboration and strives to integrate systems where appropriate.  The  Department has instantiated a Department-wide enterprise GIS on the OpenNet domain called  “GeoState.” Operated and maintained by the Center for Analytics (CfA) in the Bureau of  Management/Office of Management Strategy and Solutions (M/SS), with significant support  from IRM, GeoState provides tools for mapping, visualization, analytics, and geospatial data  "}

They can help publicize successes so decision makers may  understand the benefits of their contributions and expand the pool of resources that can be shared  amongst the communities.
