Manual/human evaluation can be costly and time consuming, and so an au- tomatic evaluation metric, given that it suffi- ciently correlates with manual evaluation, can be useful in developmental cycles. In studies involving hyperparameter tuning or architec- ture search, automatic metrics are necessary as the amount of human effort implicated in manual evaluation is generally prohibitively large.

The WMT Metrics Shared Task  $^1$    annu- ally serves as a venue to validate the use of existing metrics (including baselines such as BLEU), and to develop new ones; see  Koehn and Monz  ( 2006 ) through  Ma et al.  ( 2018 ). \nIn the setup of our Metrics Shared Task, an automatic metric compares an MT sys- tem’s output translations with manual ref- erence translations to produce: either (a) system-level  score, i.e. a single overall score for the given MT system, or (b)  segment-level scores for each of the output translations, or both. \nThis year we teamed up with the organizers of the QE Task and hosted “QE as a Metric” as a joint task. In the setup of the Quality Esti- mation Task ( Fonseca et al. ,  2019 ), no human- produced translations are provided to estimate the quality of output translations. Quality es- timation (QE) methods are built to assess MT output based on the source or based on the translation itself. In this task, QE developers were invited to perform the same scoring as standard metrics participants, with the excep- tion that they refrain from using a reference translation in production of their scores. We then evaluate the QE submissions in exactly the same way as regular metrics are evalu- ated, see below. From the point of view of correlation with manual judgements, there is no difference in metrics using or not using ref- erences. \nThe source, reference texts, and MT sys- tem outputs for the Metrics task come from the News Translation Task ( Barrault et al. , 2019 , which we denote as Findings 2019). The texts were drawn from the news domain and involve translations of English (en) to/from Czech (cs), German (de), Finnish (fi), Gu- jarati (gu), Kazakh (kk), Lithuanian (lt), Rus- sian (ru), and Chinese (zh), but excluding cs- en (15 language pairs). Three other language pairs not including English were also manu- ally evaluated as part of the News Translation Task: German  $\\rightarrow$  Czech and German  $\\leftrightarrow$  French. In total, metrics could participate in 18 lan- guage pairs, with 10 target languages. "}

The results for system- and segment-level evaluation are provided in Sections  5.1  and 5.2 , respectively, followed by a joint discussion Section  6 . \n2 Task Setup \nThis year, we provided task participants with one test set for each examined language pair, i.e. a set of source texts (which are commonly ignored by MT metrics), corresponding MT outputs (these are the key inputs to be scored) and a reference translation (held out for the participants of “QE as a Metric” track). \nIn the system-level, metrics aim to corre- late with a system’s score which is an aver- age over many human judgments of segment translation quality produced by the given sys- tem. In the segment-level, metrics aim to produce scores that correlate best with a hu- man ranking judgment of two output trans- lations for a given source segment (more on the manual quality assessment in Section  2.3 ). Participants were free to choose which lan- guage pairs and tracks (system/segment and reference-based/reference-free) they wanted to take part in. \n2.1 Source and Reference Texts \nThe source and reference texts we use are newstest2019  from this year’s WMT News Translation Task (see Findings 2019).

On one hand, if all systems are very close in their transla- tion quality, then even humans will struggle to rank them. This in turn will make the task for MT metrics very hard. On the other hand, if the task includes a wide range of systems of varying quality, correlating with humans should be generally easier, see Section  6.1  for a discussion on this. One can also expect that if the evaluated systems are of different types, they will exhibit different error patterns and various MT metrics can be differently sensi- tive to these patterns. \nThis year, all MT systems included in the Metrics Task come from the News Translation Task (see Findings 2019).

The online systems in this language directions are however standard MT systems so the German-Czech evalu- ation could be to some extent bimodal. \n•  EU Election.

This year, the of- ficial  WMT19  scores are reference-based (or “monolingual”) for some language pairs and reference-free (or “bilingual”) for others. \nDue to these different types of golden truth collection, reference-based language pairs are in a closer match with the standard reference- based metrics, while the reference-free lan- guage pairs are better fit for the “QE as a metric” subtask. \nNote that system-level manual scores are different than those of the segment-level. Since for segment-level evaluation, collecting enough DA judgements for each segment is infeasible, so we resort to converting DA judgements to golden truth expressed as relative rankings, see Section  2.3.2 . \n\nThe exact methods used to calculate corre- lations of participating metrics with the golden truth are described below, in the two sections for system-level evaluation (Section  5.1 ) and segment-level evaluation (Section  5.2 ). \n2.3.1 System-level Golden Truth: DA \nFor the system-level evaluation, the collected continuous DA scores, standardized for each annotator, are averaged across all assessed seg- ments for each MT system to produce a scalar rating for the system’s performance. \nThe underlying set of assessed segments is different for each system.

The specific meanings of \"DA>1\", \"Ave\", \"DA pairs\", and \"dARR\" would require additional context regarding the methodology or study design to fully interpret.\nnewstest2019 \nTable 1: Number of judgements for DA converted to  daRR  data; “DA  $.>$  1” is the number of source input sentences in the manual evaluation where at least two translations of that same source input segment received a DA judgement; “Ave” is the average number of translations with at least one DA judgement available for the same source input sentence; “DA pairs” is the number of all possi- ble pairs of translations of the same source input resulting from “DA  $>$  1”; and “ daRR ” is the num- ber of DA pairs with an absolute difference in DA scores greater than the 25 percentage point mar- gin. \nFrom the complete set of human assess- ments collected for the News Translation Task, all possible pairs of DA judgements attributed to distinct translations of the same source were converted into  daRR  better/worse judge- ments. Distinct translations of the same source input whose DA scores fell within 25 percentage points (which could have been deemed equal quality) were omitted from the evaluation of segment-level metrics. Conver- sion of scores in this way produced a large set of  daRR  judgements for all language pairs, shown in Table  1  due to combinatorial ad- vantage of extracting  daRR  judgements from all possible pairs of translations of the same source input. We see that only German-French and esp. French-German can suffer from in- sufficient number of these simulated pairwise comparisons. \n\nThe  daRR  judgements serve as the golden standard for segment-level evaluation in WMT19 . \n3 Baseline Metrics \nIn addition to validating popular metrics, in- cluding baselines metrics serves as comparison and prevents “loss of knowledge” as mentioned by  Bojar et al.  ( 2016 ). \nMoses scorer  $^{-6}$    is one of the MT evaluation tools that aggregated several useful metrics over the time. Since  Macháček and Bojar ( 2013 ), we have been using Moses scorer to provide most of the baseline metrics and kept encouraging authors of well-performing MT metrics to include them in Moses scorer. The baselines we report are: \nBLEU and NIST  The metrics  BLEU ( Papineni et al. , 2002 ) and NIST ( Doddington , 2002 ) were computed using mteval-v13a.pl 8 from the OpenMT Evaluation Campaign. The tool includes its own tokeniza- tion. We run  mteval  with the flag --international-tokenization . \nTER, WER, PER and CDER.  The met- rics  TER  ( Snover et al. ,  2006 ),  WER , PER  and  CDER  ( Leusch et al. ,  2006 ) were produced by the Moses scorer, which is used in Moses model optimization. We used the standard tokenizer script as available in Moses toolkit for tokeniza- tion. \nsentBLEU.  The metric  sentBLEU  is com- puted using the script  sentence-bleu , a part of the Moses toolkit.

We have collected 24 metrics from a total of 13 research groups, with 10 reference-less “met- rics” submitted to the joint task “QE as a Met- rich” with WMT19 Quality Estimation Task. The rest of this section provides a brief sum- \nmary of all the metrics that participated. \n4.1 BEER \nBEER  ( Stanojević and Sima’an ,  2015 ) is a trained evaluation metric with a linear model that combines sub-word feature indicators (character n-grams) and global word order fea- tures (skip bigrams) to achieve a language ag- nostic and fast to compute evaluation metric. BEER has participated in previous years of the evaluation task. \n4.2 BERTr \nBERTr ( Mathur et al. ,  2019 ) uses contextual word embeddings to compare the MT output with the reference translation. \nThe BERTr score of a translation is the average recall score over all tokens, us- ing a relaxed version of token matching based on BERT embeddings: namely, com- puting the maximum cosine similarity be- tween the embedding of a reference to- ken against any token in the MT out- put. BERTr uses  bert base uncased  em- beddings for the to-English language pairs, and  bert base multilingual cased  embed- dings for all other language pairs. \n4.3 CharacTER \nCharacTER  ( Wang et al. ,  2016b , a ), identi- cal to the 2016 setup, is a character-level met- ric inspired by the commonly applied transla- tion edit rate (TER). It is defined as the mini- mum number of character edits required to ad- just a hypothesis, until it completely matches the reference, normalized by the length of the hypothesis sentence.  CharacTER  calculates the character-level edit distance while per- forming the shift edit on word level. Unlike the strict matching criterion in  TER , a hy- pothesis word is considered to match a refer- ence word and could be shifted, if the edit dis- tance between them is below a threshold value. The Levenshtein distance between the refer- ence and the shifted hypothesis sequence is computed on the character level. In addition, the lengths of hypothesis sequences instead of reference sequences are used for normalizing the edit distance, which effectively counters the issue that shorter translations normally achieve lower  TER .

Since we do not have a to- tal order ranking of all translations, it is not possible to apply conventional Kendall’s Tau ( Graham et al. ,  2015 ). \n\nOur Kendall’s Tau-like formulation,    $\\tau$  , is as follows: \n\n$$\n\\tau=\\frac{|C o n c o r d a n t|-|D i s c o r d a n t|}{|C o n c o r d a n t|+|D i s c o r d a n t|}\n$$\n \nwhere  Concordant  is the set of all human com- parisons for which a given metric suggests the same order and  Discordant  is the set of all human comparisons for which a given metric disagrees. The formula is not specific with re- spect to ties, i.e. cases where the annotation says that the two outputs are equally good. \nThe way in which ties (both in human and metric judgement) were incorporated in com- puting Kendall    $\\tau$   has changed across the years of WMT Metrics Tasks. Here we adopt the version used in WMT17  daRR  evaluation. For a detailed discussion on other options, see also  Macháček and Bojar  ( 2014 ). \nWhether or not a given comparison of a pair of distinct translations of the same source in- put, s 1  and s 2 , is counted as a concordant (Conc) or disconcordant (Disc) pair is defined by the following matrix: \nThe table presents a comparison between human judgments and metric evaluations regarding the size relation of two entities, denoted as \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\). The table is organized into rows and columns:\n\n- The leftmost column represents human judgments about the relationship of sizes \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\): whether \\(s_1 < s_2\\), \\(s_1 = s_2\\), or \\(s_1 > s_2\\).\n- The top row indicates metric evaluations regarding the same comparison: \\(s_1 < s_2\\), \\(s_1 = s_2\\), or \\(s_1 > s_2\\).\n\nThe intersection of each row and column provides the result of this comparison:\n- \"Conc\" (concordant) indicates that the human judgment and metric evaluation agree.\n- \"Disc\" (discordant) indicates a disagreement between the human judgment and metric evaluation.\n- A dash (\"-\") indicates scenarios that are not applicable or where no specific information is provided.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- When humans think \\(s_1 < s_2\\) and the metric agrees (\\(s_1 < s_2\\)), it is \"Conc\".\n- When humans think \\(s_1 < s_2\\) but the metric disagrees (\\(s_1 = s_2\\) or \\(s_1 > s_2\\)), it is \"Disc\".\n- When humans think \\(s_1 = s_2\\), no matter what the metric indicates (\\(s_1 < s_2\\), \\(s_1 = s_2\\), \\(s_1 > s_2\\)), the outcome is unspecified (\"-\").\n- When humans think \\(s_1 > s_2\\) and the metric disagrees (\\(s_1 < s_2\\) or \\(s_1 = s_2\\)), it is \"Disc\".\n- When humans think \\(s_1 > s_2\\) and the metric agrees (\\(s_1 > s_2\\)), it is \"Conc\".\nIn the notation of  Macháček and Bojar ( 2014 ), this corresponds to the setup used in WMT12 (with a different underlying method of manual judgements, RR): \n\nThe key differences between the evaluation used in WMT14–WMT16 and evaluation used in WMT17–WMT19 were (1) the move from RR to daRR and (2) the treatment of ties. In the years 2014-2016, ties in metrics scores were not penalized. With the move to daRR, where the quality of the two candidate translations "}

The reference-based (mono- lingual) evaluations were obtained with the help of anonymous crowdsourcing, while the reference-less (bilingual) evaluations were mainly from MT researchers who committed their time contribution to the manual evalua- tion for each submitted system. \n6.1 Stability across MT Systems \nThe observed performance of metrics depends on the underlying texts and systems that par- ticipate in the News Translation Task (see Sec- tion  2 ). For the strongest MT systems, distin- guishing which system outputs are better is \nThe image is a plot showing the Pearson correlations between sacreBLEU and BLEU scores for English-German system-level evaluation. The x-axis represents the number of systems evaluated, ranging from all systems (approximately 20) on the left to only the top 4 systems on the right. The y-axis, which spans from -1 to +1, represents the Pearson correlation values. The colored lines denote correlations for different numbers of top systems included, with the main magenta line representing the trend as fewer top systems are considered. The baseline metrics for the language pair are displayed in grey, providing a comparative reference for the correlation values. The plot demonstrates a decline in correlation values as the number of top systems considered decreases from left to right.\nhard, even for human assessors. On the other hand, if the systems are spread across a wide performance range, it will be easier for metrics to correlate with human judgements. \nTo provide a more reliable view, we created plots of Pearson correlation when the under- lying set of MT systems is reduced to top    $n$  ones. One sample such plot is in Figure  5 , all language pairs and most of the metrics are in Appendix  A . \nAs the plot documents, the official correla- tions reported in Tables  3  to  5  can lead to wrong conclusions.  sacreBLEU-BLEU  cor- relates at .969 when all systems are considered, but as we start considering only the top    $n$   sys- tems, the correlation falls relatively quickly. With 10 systems, we are below .5 and when only the top 6 or 4 systems are considered, the correlation falls even to the negave val- ues. Note that correlations point estimates (the value in the y-axis) become noiser with the decreasing number of the underlying MT systems. \nFigure  6  explains the situation and illus- "}

For instance for German-French Pearson correlation,  chrF obtains 0.931 (no win) but  sacreBLEU- chrF  reaches 0.952, tying for a win with other metrics. \nWe thus fully support the call for clarity by Post  ( 2018b ) and invite authors of metrics to include their implementations either in Moses scorer or sacreBLEU to achieve a long-term assessment of their metric. \n7 Conclusion \nThis paper summarizes the results of  WMT19 shared task in machine translation evaluation, the Metrics Shared Task. Participating met- rics were evaluated in terms of their correla- tion with human judgement at the level of the whole test set (system-level evaluation), as well as at the level of individual sentences (segment-level evaluation). \nWe reported scores for standard metrics re- quiring the reference as well as quality estima- tion systems which took part in the track “QE as a metric”, joint with the Quality Estimation task. \nFor system-level, best metrics reach over 0.95 Pearson correlation or better across sev- eral language pairs. As expected, QE sys- tems are visibly in all language pairs but they can also reach high system-level correlations, up to .947 (Chinese-English) or .936 (English- German) by  YiSi-1_srl  or over .9 for multi- ple language pairs by  UNI . \nAn important caveat is that the correlations are heavily affected by the underlying set of MT systems. We explored this by reducing the set of systems to top-  $n$   ones for various    $n\\mathrm{s}$  and found out that for many language pairs, system-level correlations are much worse when based on only the better performing systems.
