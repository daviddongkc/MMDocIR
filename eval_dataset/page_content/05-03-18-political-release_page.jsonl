The survey was\nconducted by interviewers under the direction of Abt Associates. A combination of landline and\ncell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling\nInternational. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline\nsample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at\nhome. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if\nthat person was an adult 18 years of age or older. For detailed information about our survey\nmethodology, see http://www.pewresearch.org/methodology/u-s-survey-research/\n\nThe combined landline and cell phone sample are weighted using an iterative technique that\nmatches gender, age, education, race, Hispanic origin and nativity and region to parameters from\nthe 2016 Census Bureau's American Community Survey one-year estimates and population\ndensity to parameters from the Decennial Census. The sample also is weighted to match current\npatterns of telephone status (landline only, cell phone only, or both landline and cell phone), based\non extrapolations from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey.

The survey was  conducted by interviewers under the direction of Abt Associates. A combination of landline and  cell phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Survey Sampling  International. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline  sample were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at  home. Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if  that person was an adult 18 years of age or older.
