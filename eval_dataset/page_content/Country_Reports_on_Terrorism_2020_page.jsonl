The Defeat-ISIS Coalition worked to consolidate gains in Iraq and Syria,\nwhile broadening efforts to counter the growing ISIS threat in West Africa and the Sahel. In\nMarch the United States designated the new leader of ISIS, Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal-\nRahman al-Mawzla, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). U.S.-led military\noperations in 2020 resulted in the deaths of Qassim al-Rimi, the emir of al-Qa’ida in the Arabian\nPeninsula (AQAP), and of senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) leaders in Syria. The United States continued\nto address threats posed by state-sponsored terrorism, sanctioning Iran-supported groups such as\nIraq-based Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq and Bahrain-based Saraya al-Mukhtar. Nine countries across the\nWestern Hemisphere and Europe took significant steps in 2020 to designate, ban, or otherwise\nrestrict Hizballah — following the lead of four other governments that took similar actions the\nprevious year. Reflecting the growing threat from racially or ethnically motivated violent\nextremism (REMVE), the Department of State also designated a white supremacist terrorist\norganization for the first time in 2020, imposing sanctions against the Russian Imperial\nMovement (RIM) and three of its leaders in April.\n\nDespite important counterterrorism successes, terrorist groups remained a persistent and\npervasive threat worldwide. Although ISIS lost all the territory it had seized in Iraq and Syria,\nthe organization and its branches continued to mount a worldwide terrorism campaign, carrying\nout deadly attacks globally. Illustrating the evolving threat, ISIS affiliates outside Iraq and Syria\ncaused more fatalities during 2020 than in any previous year. ISIS maintained an active presence\nand low-level insurgency in Iraq and Syria, with increased attacks in both countries during the\nfirst half of 2020. In South and Southeast Asia, ISIS radicalized individuals to violence,\ninspiring them to conduct attacks.

The government has  accused several ethno nationalist groups, some of which it charged with violating its ATP, of  making ethnic-based attacks intended to foment ethnic conflict.

The TPLF  asserted that its actions were self-defense in the face of planned Ethiopian government action to  remove it from provincial government.

The deteriorating security environment has  worsened conditions for civilians and further constrained relief operations in northeastern  Nigeria.   \nBoko Haram and ISIS-WA carried out hundreds of attacks in Nigeria using small arms, captured  military equipment, detonated IEDs (including person borne, vehicle borne, animal borne, and  implanted), engaged in ambushes, operated illicit checkpoints and taxation systems ,  conducted  kidnappings, and perpetrated executions.  \nNigeria worked with affected neighbors in the Lake Chad Basin under the MNJTF to counter  Boko Haram and ISIS-WA.  Boko Haram and ISIS-WA continued to enjoy nearly complete  freedom of movement throughout Borno State and eastern Yobe State.  To date, terrorist actions  by Boko Haram and ISIS-WA have contributed to the internal displacement of about two million  people in the states of Adamawa, Borno, and Yobe, and the external displacement of more than  300,000 Nigerian refugees to neighboring countries, principally Cameroon, Chad, and  Niger.  According to the Bring Back Our Girls (BBOG) campaign, since the abduction of 276  students by Boko Haram from Chibok, Borno State, in 2014, 112 students remained missing at  the end of 2020.  BBOG organizers note that while most of the 113 students abducted from  Dapchi, Yobe State in 2018 had been released, one student remains in the custody of insurgents.  \nNigeria is a member of the TSCTP.  The United States restarted coordination with the Nigerian  military at the Nigerian Defense Intelligence Agency’s (NDIA’s) Joint Intelligence Fusion  Center.

Paramilitary rangers exchanged gunfire  with the attackers during pursuit, killing one of them.  •   On February 24 a VBIED ostensibly targeting a deputy district chief and a group of  territorial defense volunteers detonated outside a school and a Buddhist shrine in  Songkhla province.  Ten were wounded in the blast, including the deputy district chief,  three volunteers, four civilians, and two students.  •   On February 28 an IED targeting a para-military unit exploded on a road in Narathiwat  province, wounding six rangers.  One ranger died later in a hospital.  •   On March 17 a small IED followed by a VBIED detonated outside the Southern Border  Provinces Administration Center in Yala province.  Twenty-eight persons were wounded  in the blast, including police officers and reporters.   •   On July 15 an IED targeting a paramilitary patrol squad went off on a road in Pattani  province.  Six paramilitary rangers and four civilians were wounded.  A similar attack  took place on October 1, in Songkhla province, wounding seven military personnel, one  of whom died later in a hospital.  \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   There have been no changes since  2019.  \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Thailand is a member of the APG, and the Anti- Money Laundering Office Thailand is a member of the Egmont Group.  There were no major  changes in 2020.  \nCountering Violent Extremism:   The national counter terrorism strategy published in 2017  includes a CVE component.  Thailand lacks a national CVE action plan, but the National  Security Policy and Plan (2019-22) published in November 2019 includes regionally specific  security plans that focus on extremism.  \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   Thailand continued to support CT efforts in several  regional and multilateral organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN, ARF, ADMM,  and APEC.

Austrian law criminalizes “travel for  terrorism purposes” with prison sentences of six months to five years, extends domestic  jurisdiction to individuals in Austria who committed a crime abroad, and ensures legal counsel  for terror victims.  This law implements the EU Directive on Combating Terrorism and the  United Nations’ International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.    \nIn 2020, Austria extended temporary border checks with its Schengen neighbor countries,  introduced in 2016, and continued to deploy up to 1,000 soldiers at its eastern borders, in  "}

CTA assesses that right-wing terror threats, often radicalized to violence online, have  increased.  \n2020 Terrorist Incidents:   There were no reported terrorist incidents in Denmark in 2020. \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   Denmark continues to use its 2006  terrorism legislation that allows information sharing between its agencies responsible for  counter terrorism and FTFs — the PET and the Danish Defense Intelligence Service  (DDIS).  Efforts to counter terrorism are also shared among the Danish Police, the Public  Prosecution Service, and the Danish Prison and Probation Service.  Danish security and law  enforcement agencies share information through the CTA, which — as the Danish government’s  intelligence fusion center — constitutes the focal point for reporting from the Danish National  Police, PET, DDIS, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Danish Emergency Management  Agency.  The Danish police and the Danish defense forces share responsibility for preventing  terrorist attacks in Copenhagen and on the borders.     \nAccording to the Danish Institute for Human Rights — an independent, state-funded national  human rights institution — there are more than 20 Danish children in displaced persons camps  for family members of ISIS foreign terrorist fighters in Syria.  In 2019 the government  intervened to bring two such children (one orphaned and the other with a life-threatening injury)  home to Denmark.  According to a PET report released in March, bringing the children back to  Denmark would not pose a security threat.  However, the government has ruled out intervening  on behalf of other children, citing their parents’ choice to leave Denmark and support ISIS.  \nIn 2020, legal developments in cases involving attacks in Denmark or Danish citizens garnered  public and media attention:   \n•   In July, Danish courts sentenced Swedish citizens Zacharias Tamer Hamzi and Nurettin  Nuray Syuleyman to five and four years in jail, respectively, for bombing the Danish Tax  Agency in 2019.   •   In November, former Danish citizen Said Mansour was sentenced to death in Morocco  for his role in a 2003 terrorist attack in Casablanca that killed 45 people.  Mansour, often  referred to as the “bookseller from Brønshøj,” was stripped of his Danish citizenship in  2016 after a Danish court found him guilty of promoting terror.   •   In December, Turkey deported terror suspect and Danish citizen Jacob El-Ali to  Denmark.  According to the terrorism charges, El-Ali traveled to Syria in 2013 to fight on  behalf of ISIS.   •   Also in December, Danish citizen Ahmed Samsam returned to Denmark after more than  three years in jail in Spain.  Samsam was sentenced to eight years in prison in Spain for  joining ISIS.  According to Danish media and Samsam, he served as an undercover  intelligence officer for PET in Syria.  The Danish government has not publicly  acknowledged whether Samsam worked for PET.   "}

In 2020, Georgia adopted Rules on  the Exploitation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems to help protect Georgian airspace.    \nBorder closures enacted because of the COVID-19 pandemic helped stem the travel of known or  suspected terrorists to, from, and through Georgia.  No Georgian citizens were observed  traveling to Syria or Iraq in 2020 for terrorist activities.  Georgian border patrol agents check  individuals, vehicles, and travel documents against national and INTERPOL databases.    \nIn May, Georgian citizen Tsezar Tokhosashvili was extradited to Georgia from Ukraine for his  involvement in ISIS-related activities.  Georgian courts tried and convicted Tokhosashvili for  participating in a terrorist organization and sentenced him to 10 years’ imprisonment.    \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Georgia is a member of MONEYVAL.  Georgia’s  FIU, the Financial Monitoring Service of Georgia, is a member of the Egmont Group. Georgia is  also a member of the Defeat-ISIS CIFG. In September, MONEYVAL approved an evaluation  report on Georgia conducted in 2019, noting Georgia’s progress in recent years and determining  that Georgia’s counter terrorism-financing investigations and prosecutions reached a substantial  level of effectiveness.  In March, Georgia participated in the Warsaw Process Working Group on  Counter terrorism and Illicit Financing — led by the United States, Poland, Morocco, and Kenya  in Morocco.    \nIn June and July, Georgia further refined its AML/CFT laws, including by designating the  National Bank of Georgia as the AML/CFT supervisor, mandating that Georgian financial  institutions screen against UNSC sanctions lists, and adopting two bylaws related to reporting,  recordkeeping, and customer identification.  To implement UNSC sanctions lists, Georgia as of  mid-December had submitted nine motions requesting that the assets of seven individuals and  five entities be frozen, as well as five motions to unfreeze the assets of four individuals and 27  entities.

Draft  legislation that would make it a punishable offense to reside in an area controlled by a terrorist  organization without prior permission has been pending in the First Chamber of Parliament for  the duration of the reporting period.    \nSignificant law enforcement and judicial actions related to CT included the following:  \n•   On March 20, Gokman Tanis was sentenced to life in prison for murder, attempted  murder, and making threats with terrorist intent, for the 2019 attack on a train in Utrecht  killing four people.    •   On October 8, six individuals in the “Arnhem group,” who were arrested in 2018,  received sentences ranging from 10 to 17 years on charges of preparing a multitarget  terrorist attack in the Netherlands.    •   On October 27, authorities arrested two Dutch citizens on charges including incitement,  carrying a weapon, and participation in an organization that has the intention of  committing terrorist crimes.  Both individuals were active on REMVE social media  channels.   •   On November 16 the Amsterdam Court of Appeal sentenced Jawad Sultani, convicted of  the 2018 terrorist stabbing of two American citizens, to 25 years in prison.  The court  overturned the conviction for threatening Dutch police officers but upheld the conviction  for the stabbing with terrorist intent.    \nThe government does not actively repatriate FTFs and their children from camps in Syria, but it  escorted about five FTFs who reported to Dutch diplomatic missions in the region.  All persons  known to have traveled to the conflict areas in Syria and Iraq are under criminal investigation.   The courts considered several cases involving female FTFs who wished to be repatriated, along  with their children, from displaced persons camps in Syria to stand trial in the Netherlands.  In  each instance, the court upheld the 2019 decision that the government is not obligated to actively  repatriate FTFs.    \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   The Netherlands is a member of FATF and is one of  the Cooperating and Supporting Nations of the Caribbean Financial Action Task Force, a FATF- style regional body.  Its FIU, the Financial Intelligence Unit-Netherlands, is a member of the  Egmont Group and contributes to EUROPOL’s financial intelligence team.  The Netherlands is  also a member of the Defeat ISIS CIFG.  There have been no changes to the Netherlands’  membership in FATF and FATF-style regional bodies in 2020.   "}

The PKK claimed responsibility for the attack.    \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   Turkey has a broad definition of  terrorism that includes so-called crimes against constitutional order and internal and external  security of the state, which the government regularly used to criminalize the exercise of freedom  of expression and peaceful assembly.  According to the Ministry of Interior, in the first seven  months of this year, it examined 14,186 social media accounts and took legal action against more  than 6,743 social media users whom it accused of propagandizing or promoting terror  organizations, inciting persons to enmity and hostility, or insulting state institutions.  Legal  actions taken by Turkey against the accused included a mix of charges related to terrorism or  other criminal activity under Turkish law.  Turkey has advanced law enforcement capacity to  combat terrorism, and efforts continue to streamline interagency information sharing.  Turkey  sometimes deports suspected FTFs without providing advance notice to the destination countries,  but coordination with receiving countries has improved following a 2019 ultimatum to European  countries to take back their citizens.    \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Turkey is a member of FATF.  Its FIU, the Financial  Crimes Investigation Board (called MASAK), is a member of the Egmont Group.  Turkey is also  a member of the Defeat-ISIS CIFG.  In December, Turkey promulgated a new law on terrorism  finance, money laundering, and nonproliferation that addressed many of the deficiencies  identified in the FATF 2019 mutual evaluation.    \nCountering Violent Extremism:   The Turkish National Police (TNP) undertakes social  projects, activities with parents, and in-service training for officers and teachers. Programs  prepare medical, community, and religious officials for intervening to undermine terrorist  messaging and to prevent recruitment.  The Ministry of Justice implements some rehabilitation  and reintegration programs for convicts and former criminals.  The Ministry of Interior claimed  that by year’s end 321 PKK members had surrendered to Turkish security forces, including 243  PKK members who were persuaded to surrender by their family members.    \nTurkey’s Religious Affairs Presidency (Diyanet) reports that it works to “undermine terrorist  messaging by promoting its inclusive version of Islam.”  Antalya is a member of the Strong  Cities Network.    \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   Turkey is a member of the United Nations, NATO,  the Committee of Experts on Terrorism of the Council of Europe, and the Global Coalition to  Defeat ISIS.  It co-chairs, with Kuwait and the Netherlands, the Defeat-ISIS Coalition FTF  Working Group.  Turkey regularly participates in GCTF meetings and initiatives. Turkey also  "}

Algeria continued its significant\nefforts to prevent terrorist activity within its borders and as a result remains a difficult operating\nenvironment for terrorist groups. Algerian armed forces and internal security forces published\nfigures that showed continued pressure on terrorist groups, conducting a steady drumbeat of\noperations to arrest and eliminate terrorist suspects, dismantle and disrupt terrorist cells, and\ndestroy hideouts, arms, and other equipment. These ongoing operations significantly degraded\nthe capacities of terrorist groups to operate within Algeria. AQIM and ISIS’s Algeria branch\nremained in the country but were under considerable pressure from Algerian security authorities.\nThe elimination of several leaders and high-profile members of terrorist groups inside and\noutside of Algeria, particularly AQIM, further diminished their capacity. These groups aspire to\nimpose their interpretations of Islamic law on the region and to attack Algerian security services,\nlocal government targets, and Western interests. Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and\nTunisia — as well as human, weapons, and narcotics trafficking — contributed to the overall\nthreat, particularly in border regions.\n\nAlgeria’s domestic efforts to defeat ISIS through counter-messaging and their capacity-building\nprograms with neighboring states contribute to the Global Defeat-ISIS Coalition mission.\n\n2020 Terrorist Incident: On February 9 an individual conducted a vehicle-borne improvised\nexplosive device (VBIED) suicide attack targeting a military outpost in southern Algeria, near the\nborder with Mali, killing himself and one Algerian soldier.

Algeria continued its significant  efforts to prevent terrorist activity within its borders and as a result remains a difficult operating  environment for terrorist groups.  Algerian armed forces and internal security forces published  figures that showed continued pressure on terrorist groups, conducting a steady drumbeat of  operations to arrest and eliminate terrorist suspects, dismantle and disrupt terrorist cells, and  destroy hideouts, arms, and other equipment.  These ongoing operations significantly degraded  the capacities of terrorist groups to operate within Algeria.  AQIM and ISIS’s Algeria branch  remained in the country but were under considerable pressure from Algerian security authorities.   The elimination of several leaders and high-profile members of terrorist groups inside and  outside of Algeria, particularly AQIM, further diminished their capacity.  These groups aspire to  impose their interpretations of Islamic law on the region and to attack Algerian security services,  local government targets, and Western interests.  Terrorist activity in Libya, Mali, Niger, and  Tunisia — as well as human, weapons, and narcotics trafficking — contributed to the overall  threat, particularly in border regions.  \nAlgeria’s domestic efforts to defeat ISIS through counter-messaging and their capacity-building  programs with neighboring states contribute to the Global Defeat-ISIS Coalition mission.  \n2020 Terrorist Incident:   On February 9 an individual conducted a vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive device ( VBIED) suicide attack targeting a military outpost in southern Algeria, near the  border with Mali, killing himself and one Algerian soldier.  ISIS took credit for the attack, the  first of its kind in Algeria since 2017, in retaliation for an earlier Algerian CT operation against  the group.    \nLegislation, Law Enforcement, and Border Security:   There were no significant changes to  Algeria’s CT legal framework in 2020.  The Ministry of Justice established a small unit to  prosecute international terrorism and transnational crime and started investigating its first case in  November.  In 2020 the Algerian judicial system tried and convicted several terrorists and their  supporters.

These included the various branches of the Joint Staff, the Algerian army, the National  Gendarmerie, and border guards under the Ministry of National Defense (MND); and the  national police, or General Directorate of National Security, under the Ministry of Interior.   Public information announcements from the MND provided timely reporting on incidents during  which MND forces captured or eliminated terrorists, dismantled and disrupted terrorist cells, and  seized equipment, arms, ammunition caches, and drugs.  \nSeveral clashes took place between terrorists and security forces during sweeping operations in  which AQIM and ISIS primarily used IEDs and small arms.  On March 7, a homemade bomb  exploded during an army sweeping operation in Chlef, killing two soldiers, and on June 20 a  corporal was killed in a clash with an unidentified likely AQIM-aligned terrorist group in the Aïn  Defla province, during which an alleged terrorist surrendered to Algerian forces.  A homemade  bomb exploded during an army sweeping operation in Médéa province on June 27, killing two  soldiers.  Algerian forces killed three alleged terrorists — one of them a high-profile leader —  during a December 1 operation in the northeastern province of Jijel.

In  December the Egyptian military announced that air strikes destroyed a convoy of 21 vehicles  attempting to illegally cross Egypt’s border with Libya.  At border crossings and airports,  Egyptian authorities continued to authenticate travel documents by verifying the presence of  advanced security features.  They also conducted checks of some individuals and shared  derogatory information among border security authorities for further action.  Egypt maintains a  terrorist watchlist for Egyptian immigration officials at the ports of entry, with detailed  information maintained by the security services.  The United States assisted Egypt’s  counter terrorism efforts by providing training, equipment, and other assistance to its law  enforcement and security services.  \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Egypt is a member of MENAFATF, serving as the  chair in 2020.  Its FIU, Egypt’s Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Combating Unit, is a  member of the Egmont Group and the National Council of Payments.

In November Kuwait FIU  participated in a virtual workshop on Understanding Money Laundering Crimes.  In December  the Kuwaiti anticorruption authority Nazaha participated in a virtual workshop on corruption,  money-laundering crimes, and investigative techniques.  Kuwait also concentrated on law  enforcement and judicial capacity-building across a broad spectrum of government agencies.  \nIn March the Court of Cassation, the country’s highest court, upheld the 10-year prison sentences  of three Kuwaiti citizens and   the two-year prison sentence of one Syrian national for joining ISIS  and plotting to blow up mosques.  In July, authorities arrested six individuals, including an  Iranian national accused of participating in a money-laundering ring tied to Hizballah.  In  October the Court of Cassation upheld a sentence of life imprisonment for an Egyptian who had  joined ISIS and was arrested in 2016 for attempting to kill five U.S. soldiers.  In December,  authorities arrested three Kuwaitis for possessing unlicensed weapons and promoting an  “extremist ideology” connected to ISIS.  \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   Kuwait is a member of MENAFATF.

Kuwait is also a  member of the Defeat-ISIS CIFG and the Riyadh-based TFTC.  \nIn collaboration with other TFTC member states, in July, Kuwait sanctioned six individuals and  entities affiliated with ISIS terror-support networks in the region.  Kuwait is currently preparing  its National Risk Assessment, which is one of the key requirements of FATF.  The nation is  scheduled to deliver its FATF Mutual Evaluation Report in 2022.  \nCountering Violent Extremism:   As part of the government’s National Plan to Reinforce  Moderation, the Ministry of Information continued to run a television channel with programming  aimed at audiences believed to be at higher risk of radicalization to violence.  The Kuwait  Moderation Center, which operates under the supervision of the Ministry of Religious  Endowments, continued a variety of programs designed to promote religious tolerance.  The  center also sponsored radio programs to promote tolerance among youth.  \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   As an active member of the Global Coalition to  Defeat ISIS Small Group, Kuwait participated in ministerial-level meetings throughout the year.   Kuwait is also an active member of the Arab League, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,  and the Islamic Military Counter Terrorism Coalition.  As a member of the Gulf Cooperation  Council (GCC), Kuwait continued its leading role in the effort to mediate the dispute between  Qatar and other GCC members.  \nLEBANON  \nOverview:   Lebanon is a committed partner in the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  In 2020 the  United States provided security assistance and training to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) and  worked with Lebanon’s law enforcement organizations, such as the Internal Security Forces  (ISF), to enhance their counter terrorism capabilities and investigate and prosecute local terrorism  cases.

The UAE hosts the Sawab  Center, a bilateral partnership with the United States to amplify credible voices to counter  terrorist messaging online and continued to support  Hedayah , the International Center of  Excellence for Countering Violent Extremism.  Prominent UAE officials, religious leaders, and  think tanks continued to publicly criticize and highlight the dangers of what they viewed as  terrorist narratives, most notably that of the Muslim Brotherhood, which the UAE designated as  a terrorist group.  \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   The UAE participated in AML/CFT workshops  with the European Union and the United Kingdom.  The UAE also supported the Blueprint of a  Rehabilitation and Reintegration Center, which was co-presented with the United States on the  sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.  \nYEMEN  \nOverview:   AQAP, ISIS-Yemen, and Iran-backed terrorist groups such as Hizballah and the  IRGC-QF continued to exploit the political and security vacuum created by the ongoing conflict  between the Republic of Yemen government under the leadership of President Abd Rabu  Mansour Hadi, internationally recognized as the legitimate Government of Yemen, and Houthi  militants, as well as the ongoing south-south conflict between the Republic of Yemen  government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC).  Additionally, IRGC-QF continued to  exploit the conflict to expand Iran’s influence in Yemen.  UN and other reporting have  highlighted connections between the IRGC-QF and the Houthis, including the provision of lethal  aid used by the Houthis to undertake attacks against critical infrastructure sites in Saudi Arabia.   Media reports suggest that Hizballah may also be supporting the Houthi militants.  \nThe Republic of Yemen government, in partnership with the Saudi-led coalition, controlled less  Yemeni territory at the end of 2020 than it did in 2019.  The Republic of Yemen government’s  loss of control over additional parts of its territory resulted from political and military tensions in  the South and Houthi advances in other governorates of the country.  In the South the STC  temporarily declared “self-administration” between April and July, which was not recognized by  the international community.  Negotiations to implement the 2019 Riyadh Agreement culminated  in the December 30 return of a newly formed government to Aden, but this failed to eliminate  tensions in the South, where AQAP and ISIS-Yemen maintained significant areas of influence.   Concurrently, Houthi militants who controlled the de jure capital of Sana’a and surrounding  northwest highlands, as well as the port city of Hudaydah, made key advances eastward and  southward to parts of the governorates of al-Jawf, al-Bayda, and Ma’rib.

However, attacks against\nprovincial capitals and district centers declined.

Significant\nterrorist incidents in 2020 included the following:\n\ne On March 7, after attacking a progovernment militia outpost in Herat province, the\nTaliban kidnapped and killed seven civilians.\n\ne On March 6, at least 32 civilians were killed when gunmen attacked an event in Kabul\nattended by opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah.\n\ne On March 25, ISIS-K gunmen attacked a Sikh temple in Kabul, killing 25 and injuring\n11.\n\ne On May 12, three ISIS-K gunmen killed 24 persons, including mothers and babies, and\ninjured at least 20 in a complex attack involving gunmen and grenades at a Médecins\nSans Frontiéres hospital maternity ward in a predominantly Shia neighborhood of Kabul.\n", "vlm_text": "\nInternational human rights organizations continued to express concern that some Central Asian  governments used “extremism” laws to prosecute and convict political dissidents or religious  activists with no ties to terrorism or violent extremism.  \nAFGHANISTAN \nOverview:   The United States partnered with Afghanistan on a bilateral counter terrorism effort  through Operation Freedom’s Sentinel.  The U.S. military, along with 37 other Defeat-ISIS  Coalition nations, supported the ANDSF through NATO-led Resolute Support’s “Train, Advise,  and Assist” mission.  In 2020 the Taliban and the affiliated HQN continued attacks targeting  Afghan civilians and government officials.  Drawing largely from information compiled in 2019,  the UN Security Council reported on May 27 that relations between al-Qa’ida and the Taliban  remained close.  ISIS-K continued to perpetrate high-profile attacks against civilians,  journalists, religious minorities, and members of the international community.  The attack trend  in 2020 remained high, apart from a seven-day period before the signing of the U.S.-Taliban  Agreement and three-day ceasefires for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Qurban.  ISIS-K, elements of al- Qa’ida (including affiliate AQIS), and terrorist groups targeting Pakistan, such as TTP,  continued to use the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region as a safe haven.   \n2020 Terrorist Incidents:   Attacks attributed to insurgent and terrorist activity continued at high  levels in 2020.  Militants conducted high-profile complex attacks involving multiple attackers,  vehicle-borne IEDs (VBIEDs), and magnetically attached IEDs (or MAIEDs) to target ANDSF,  government buildings, public infrastructure, and other civilian targets.  However, attacks against  provincial capitals and district centers declined.  In addition, direct targeting of U.S. interests  dropped significantly in 2020 owing to stipulations within the U.S.-Taliban agreement that  prohibited Taliban attacks on foreigners.  At year’s end, no U.S. servicemember had been killed  on the battlefield since the February 29 signing of the agreement and announcement of the U.S.- Afghanistan Joint Declaration.  Terrorist groups continued to torture, recruit, and use child  soldiers and target attacks against religious minority groups and journalists.  According to  Resolute Support Mission reporting, between January 1 and September 30, insurgent and  terrorist attacks were responsible for killing 1,818 civilians and wounding 3,488.  Significant  terrorist incidents in 2020 included the following:   \n•   On March 7, after attacking a progovernment militia outpost in Herat province, the  Taliban kidnapped and killed seven civilians.   •   On March 6, at least 32 civilians were killed when gunmen attacked an event in Kabul  attended by opposition leader Abdullah Abdullah.  •   On March 25, ISIS-K gunmen attacked a Sikh temple in Kabul, killing 25 and injuring  11.   •   On May 12, three ISIS-K gunmen killed 24 persons, including mothers and babies, and  injured at least 20 in a complex attack involving gunmen and grenades at a Médecins  Sans Frontières hospital maternity ward in a predominantly Shia neighborhood of Kabul.

Most states have created antiterrorism squads and “anti-Maoist” units for prevention,  detection, and first response, with varying capabilities.    \nThe National Security Guard (NSG) is the sole federal authority responsible for national  counter terrorism response.  With five regional hubs operational across India, the NSG has  improved its response time and reduced past dependence on other agencies for  logistics.  Challenges include budget constraints and dependence on temporary details and  volunteers from the armed forces.   \nIndian security agencies are effective in disrupting terror threats, although gaps remain in  interagency intelligence and information sharing.  The Indian Multi-Agency Centre (MAC)  collaborates with the United States on exchanging terrorist screening information.  In the absence  of a National Counter Terrorism Center, the MAC conducts real-time collation and sharing of  intelligence among federal and state security agencies.  Several Indian states have established  state-level MACs to disseminate terrorism information to law enforcement.  Indian security  forces demonstrate limited capacity to patrol and secure extensive maritime and land borders.   India is implementing UNSCR 2396 to improve detection and deterrence of terrorist travel by  using watchlists, implementing biographic and biometric screening at ports of entry, and  expanding information sharing.   \nIndia collaborates with the United States on implementing UNSCR 2309 and is enforcing  compliance with the dual-screen X-ray mandate for cargo screening at airport locations.  There  were 66 known Indian-origin fighters affiliated with ISIS, as of November.  No FTFs were  repatriated to India during 2020.   \nIndian counter terrorism forces, at the federal and state levels, actively detected and disrupted  transnational and regional terrorist groups.  The NIA arrested 10 alleged al-Qa’ida-affiliated  operatives from Kerala and West Bengal on September 19 and 26.  Through the end of  September, the NIA had investigated 34 terrorism cases it indicated were related to ISIS and  arrested 160 persons.  The Kolkata Police counter terrorism Special Task Force  on May 29  arrested Abdul Karim, the second-in-command of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh, on  suspicion of involvement in a 2013 bombing in Bodh Gaya.   \nIndia responds to U.S. requests for information related to terrorism investigations in a timely  manner and makes efforts to mitigate threats in response to U.S. information.  Over the past two  years, collaborative efforts have disrupted terrorist travel and alerted U.S. authorities to possible  threats in the United States and against U.S. interests.  \nCountering the Financing of Terrorism:   India is a member of FATF, APG, and the Eurasian  Group on Combating Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (EAG).

The strategy was developed with the  assistance of the UN Regional Center for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia and the UN  Counter-Terrorism Office and was approved by the President of Turkmenistan in December  2019.  The Government of Turkmenistan continued to place heavy restrictions on and imprison  groups it classifies as extremist, including those groups’ political and religious expression and  activities.    \nInternational and Regional Cooperation:   Turkmenistan works with international and regional  organizations such as the UN Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force, the UN Regional  Centre for Preventive Diplomacy for Central Asia, UNODC, the UN Counter-Terrorism Centre,  the EU, and the OSCE.   \nAs a member of the  $_{\\mathrm{C}5+1}$   diplomatic platform, Turkmenistan participates in the associated  Security Working Group, which focuses on regional CT cooperation.  In June the U.S. Secretary  of State and the Foreign Ministers of the five Central Asian states met virtually in the  $_{\\mathrm{C}5+1}$    format to discuss multilateral efforts to build economic resilience and strengthen security in the  region.  The participants agreed to continue within the framework of the   $_{\\mathrm{C}5+1}$   Security Working  Group to increase border security and counter terrorism and violent extremism.  In October,  Turkmenistan participated in a trilateral meeting with the United States and Afghanistan and  expressed support for expanding cooperation with Afghanistan on border security,  counter narcotics, and counter terrorism.  The Government of Turkmenistan stated its full support  for the Afghan peace process and offered to host peace talks in Ashgabat.  \nIn February, Turkmenistan and Russia held consultations at the deputy foreign minister level to  discuss countering terrorism finance and transnational crime in the Caspian region.  The talks  focused on identifying and suppressing sources and channels of financing terrorism, countering  the spread of violent extremism and cross-border movements of foreign terrorist fighters, and  coordinating positions within key multilateral platforms.   \nIn 2020, Turkmen Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov held several virtual meetings with  multilateral organizations to discuss regional security and counter terrorism in Central Asia.  In  November, FM Meredov took part in a videoconference with the United Nations Assistance  Mission in Afghanistan to discuss progress in the intra-Afghan peace talks and the importance of  combating terrorism and cross-border crime.  Later that month, FM Meredov also met virtually  with UNODC to discuss increasing cooperation to counter transnational organized crime,  terrorism, and illicit drug trafficking.  FM Meredov also took part in November’s 16th EU- "}

Panama also has an executive decree to address chemical, biological,  radiological, and nuclear incidents.  While the country does not have a formal coordinating  authority below the cabinet level, officials from Panama’s National Security Council, National  Border Service (or SENAFRONT), National Migration Service, and National Police met  frequently with U.S. government officials to coordinate and act on migration alerts and to detain  and deport travelers who represented a security risk.  Panama collected biographic and biometric  data, shared information with regional partners (including advanced passenger information), and  participated in INTERPOL, in accordance with UNSCR 2396.  Panama used the CT-provided  Personal Identification and Secure Comparison and Evaluation System (or PISCES) as its  frontline passenger screening and integrated border management system.  \nPanama used the SIA Joint Task Force — a bilateral mechanism to share information on SIAs  and Known or Suspected Terrorists and detain and/or deport them as needed — to cooperate on  several CT-related cases.  Since FY 2019 the SIA Joint Task Force has processed Panama’s  BITMAP data and provided intelligence information, analytical products, and migration trends to  Panamanian officers.  The country’s biometric enrollments provided U.S. agencies information  on foreign partners’ law enforcement and border encounters of SIAs, gang members, and other  persons of interest.  In 2020, Panama processed 6,782 enrollments, a decrease from 2019 because  of COVID-19 border closures.  \nWhile Panama’s own intelligence capacity was limited, the Government of Panama acted as a  willing partner in responding to U.S. alerts.  Logistical challenges, such as routing flights for  deportations and the lack of diplomatic relationships with some migrants’ countries of origin,  limited Panama’s ability to deport.  "}

Iranian forces have directly  backed militia operations in Syria with armored vehicles, artillery, and drones.  \nSince the end of the 2006 Israeli-Hizballah conflict, Iran has supplied Hizballah in Lebanon with  thousands of rockets, missiles, and small arms in violation of UNSCR 1701.  Israeli security  officials and politicians expressed concerns that Iran was supplying Hizballah with advanced  weapons systems and technologies, as well as assisting the group in creating infrastructure that  would permit it to indigenously produce rockets and missiles to threaten Israel from Lebanon and  Syria.  Iran has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in support of Hizballah and trained  thousands of its fighters at camps in Iran.  Hizballah fighters have been used extensively in Syria  to support the Assad regime.   \nIn 2020, Iran provided support to Hamas and other designated Palestinian terrorist groups,  including Palestine Islamic Jihad and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command.  These Palestinian terrorist groups were behind numerous deadly attacks originating  in Gaza and the West Bank.  \nIn Bahrain, Iran has continued to provide weapons, support, and training to local Shia militant  groups, including the al-Ashtar Brigades, a designated FTO and Specially Designated Global  Terrorist (SDGT), and Saraya al-Mukhtar, which was designated an SDGT under Department of  State authorities in 2020.   \nIn Yemen, Iran has provided weapons, advanced equipment such as unmanned aircraft systems,  training, and other support to Houthi militants, who have engaged in attacks against regional  targets.  In February and June, the U.S. Navy and partner forces interdicted dhows carrying Iran- origin weapons intended for the Houthis, including 1,700 rifles and more than 170 missiles.  \nThe Iranian government maintains a robust offensive cyber program and has sponsored cyber  attacks against foreign government and private sector entities.  \nIran remained unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qa’ida (AQ) members residing in the  country and has refused to publicly identify members it knows to be living in Iran.  Iran has  allowed AQ facilitators to operate a core facilitation pipeline through Iran since at least 2009,  enabling AQ to move funds and fighters to South Asia and Syria, among other locales.  "}

The Saudi-led  coalition, which includes Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), provided support  to the Republic of Yemen government (ROYG) which continued to fight to reclaim territory held  by Iran-backed Houthi militants.  The ROYG, with the support of the Saudis and Emiratis,  continued counter terrorism operations to degrade al-Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)  and ISIS-Yemen operations in the country.  However, owing to the ongoing conflict, the ROYG  was severely constrained in its ability to prevent terrorist training, funding, recruitment, and  transit.  Although AQAP and ISIS-Yemen have been degraded in recent years, the two groups  continued to benefit from the ongoing conflict with the Houthis, successfully instilling  themselves among elements of the anti-Houthi coalition and exploiting the security vacuum in  large parts of the country.  Further, AQAP continued to harbor external operations  ambitions.  Under President Hadi’s leadership, the ROYG has been as cooperative with U.S.,  Saudi, and UAE counter terrorism operations as its limited capacity will allow.  "}

The United States supported CTC and  CTED efforts to assess evolving terrorist trends and to analyze capacity gaps of member  states to implement UNSCRs 1373, 1624, 2178, 2396, and other relevant  counter terrorism resolutions, and to facilitate training and other technical assistance to  UN member states.  In 2020, CTED held six open briefings on issues including terrorist  threats to civil aviation and the role of the criminal justice sector in bringing terrorists to  justice through effective use of battlefield- or military-collected evidence.  CTED also  completed 67 Overview of Implementation Assessments and Detailed Implementation  Surveys and shared 18 assessment visit reports with the Global Counter terrorism  Coordination Platform, which was launched in March.  To support UN capacity building  activities, CTED shared its prioritized technical assistance needs from 2016 through 2020  with the UN Office of Counter terrorism.  \n•   The UNSC 1267/1989/2253 ISIL (Da’esh) and al-Qa’ida Sanctions Committee.   The  United States worked closely with the UN Sanctions Committee and its monitoring team  in 2020 by proposing listings, providing amendments, engaging the committee’s  ombudsperson regarding petitions for de-listings, and providing input to the committee to  enhance its procedures and implementation of sanctions measures.  The United States  also assisted the monitoring team with information for its research and reports.  In 2020,  five groups and three individuals were added to the 1267 Sanctions List, including five  more ISIS affiliates and the new leader of ISIS, Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal-Rahman  al-Mawla.  Three individuals were de-listed, and 17 entities and 69 individuals had their  existing entries amended during the year.  The total figures on the list are 264 individuals  and 89 entities, as of December 31.  The committee also worked to ensure the integrity of  the list by conducting regular reviews and by endeavoring to remove those individuals  and entities that no longer meet the criteria for listing.

Hedayah   recently launched MASAR 2.0, a mobile application that will help CVE practitioners and  policymakers effectively monitor and evaluate CVE programs.  In direct response to the  global need to address returning FTFs,  Hedayah  developed the  Blueprint of a  Rehabilitation and Reintegration Center: Guiding Principles for Rehabilitating and  Reintegrating Foreign Terrorist Fighters and Their Family Members.   In 2020,  Hedayah   launched a CT Bureau-supported CVE program focused on Tunisia and Tajikistan to  develop and disseminate counter messaging content for vulnerable communities, build  resiliency to counter the use of the internet for terrorist purposes, and assist governments  in implementing their CVE national action plans.    \nMore broadly, the CT Bureau leveraged other U.S. and donor government support  for  Hedayah  programming — including USAID support for CVE communications work in  Kenya.   \nCivilian Counter terrorism Capacity Building Programs  \nAs the terrorist threat has evolved and significantly expanded geographically in recent years, it has  become clear that mitigating this threat depends on the political will and enhanced capabilities of our  partners to counter terrorism.  To succeed over the long term, the United States must have partners  who not only prevent, disrupt, and degrade networks militarily or through law enforcement, while  comporting with international laws and norms, but also leverage robust civilian capabilities.  The  United States needs partners in law enforcement, the justice sector, and corrections that can prevent  and disrupt attacks and investigate, arrest, prosecute, and incarcerate terrorists and their facilitation  networks.

Despite the Egypt-mediated cease-fire between Israel and  Hamas that year, operatives from Hamas and the Palestine Islamic Jihad coordinated and carried  out a bus bombing in Tel Aviv later that year that wounded 29 people.  \nOn July 8, 2014, Israel launched Operation Protective Edge in Gaza with the intent of preventing  rocket fire into Israel; the rocket fire from Gaza had increased following earlier Israeli military  operations that targeted Hamas for the kidnapping and murder of three Israeli teenagers in 2014,  including 16-year-old U.S.-Israeli citizen Naftali Fraenkel.  In 2016, a Hamas member carried  out a suicide attack on a bus in Jerusalem, killing 20 people.    \nHamas-organized protests at the border between Gaza and Israel continued throughout much of  2019, resulting in clashes that killed Hamas members, Palestinian protestors, and Israeli soldiers.   Hamas claimed responsibility for numerous rocket attacks from Gaza into Israeli territory  throughout 2018, and the Israeli military reported that some rocket attacks in 2019 and 2020  came from Hamas launchers. In August the Israeli military accused Hamas of being responsible  for launching incendiary devices tied to balloons into Israel, causing more than 400 blazes in  southern Israel.   \nStrength:   Hamas comprises several thousand Gaza-based operatives.    \nLocation/Area of Operation:   Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon   \nFunding and External Aid:   Hamas has received funding, weapons, and training from Iran and  raises funds in Gulf countries.  The group receives donations from some Palestinians and other  expatriates as well as from its own charity organizations.    \nHaqqani Network \nAka  HQN   \nDescription:   Designated as an FTO on September 19, 2012, the Haqqani Network (HQN) was  formed in the late 1980s, around the time of the then-Soviet Union’s invasion of Afghanistan.   HQN’s founder Jalaluddin Haqqani established a relationship with Usama bin Laden in the  mid-1980s and joined the Taliban in 1995.  After the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001,  Haqqani retreated to Pakistan where, under the leadership of his son Sirajuddin, HQN continued  to direct and conduct terrorist activity in Afghanistan.  In 2015, Sirajuddin Haqqani was  appointed Deputy Leader of the Taliban.    "}

The  group was formed in 1989 and is one of the largest and oldest militant groups operating in the  Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir.  HM is led by Mohammad Yusuf Shah, also  known as Syed Salahuddin, and officially supports the liberation of Jammu and Kashmir from  Indian control and its accession to Pakistan, although some cadres are pro-independence.  The  group concentrates its attacks on Indian security forces and politicians in Jammu and Kashmir  and has conducted operations jointly with other Kashmiri militants.  HM is made up primarily of  ethnic Kashmiris.  \nActivities:   HM has claimed responsibility for several attacks in the Indian Union Territory of  Jammu and Kashmir.  In 2015, the group claimed an attack on Indian security forces in Kupwara  that killed three Indian troops, according to the targeted forces.  HM launched additional attacks  against Indian security forces in 2015 and 2016.  In 2017, HM killed seven persons — including  five policemen — when it attacked a bank van carrying cash in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018,  HM reportedly killed four police officers in Shopian district in the Indian state Jammu and  Kashmir.  Also in 2018, HM claimed responsibility for abducting and killing three police  officials in Jammu and Kashmir.  \nIn 2019, Indian officials accused HM of being behind a grenade attack on a Jammu bus stand  that killed a teenager and injured 32 other people.  That same year, two Indian soldiers were  killed and six others injured when an alleged HM militant attacked their patrol with a vehicle- borne IED (or VBIED).  HM was also suspected by police of having killed five Bengali laborers  and a truck driver in 2019. In August, three HM militants opened fire on Indian soldiers during a  search operation in the Indian Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, killing one soldier.  "}

During that  time, the group assassinated Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze’evi in 2001, carried out at  least two suicide operations, and launched multiple joint operations with other Palestinian  terrorist groups.    \nIn 2014, two Palestinians reportedly affiliated with the PFLP entered a Jerusalem synagogue and  attacked Israelis with guns, knives, and axes, killing 5 persons — including 3 U.S. citizens —  and injuring 12.  A month later, the PFLP claimed responsibility for several rocket attacks along  the Lebanese-Israel border.    \nIn 2017, three Palestinian militants launched an attack near Jerusalem’s Old City, stabbing and  killing an Israeli border security agent.  Two of the militants were PFLP members, although ISIS  claimed responsibility for the attack.  "}

India’s National Investigation Agency  arrested 10 alleged al Qa’ida-affiliated operatives from Kerala and West Bengal on September  19 and 26.    \nStrength:   AQIS is estimated to have several hundred members.  \nLocation/Area of Operations:   Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan   \nFunding and External Aid:   AQIS likely receives funding from al-Qa’ida senior leadership and  engages in general criminal activity, kidnapping, and extortion.    \nal-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb \nAka  AQIM; GSPC;  Le Groupe Salafiste Pour la Predication et le Combat;  Salafist Group for  Preaching and Combat; Salafist Group for Call and Combat; Tanzim al-Qa’ida fi Bilad al- Maghrib al-Islamiya   \nDescription:   The Salafist Group for Call and Combat (GSPC) was designated as an FTO on  March 27, 2002.  The Department of State amended the GSPC designation on February 20,  2008, after the GSPC officially joined with al-Qa’ida in 2006 and al-Qa’ida in the Islamic  Maghreb (AQIM) became the primary name of the group.  Although AQIM remains largely a  regionally focused terrorist group, it has adopted a more anti-western rhetoric and ideology.  The  group aspires to overthrow “apostate” African regimes and create an Islamic state.  Following  the death of AQIM leader Abdelmalek Droukdel, who was killed in June by French forces, the  group chose Abu Obaida Yusuf al-Annabi as Droukdel’s successor.  \nActivities:   Following AQIM’s 2007 bombing of the UN headquarters building and an Algerian  government building in Algiers, which killed 60 people, AQIM’s northern leadership was  contained to northeastern Algeria, while the group’s southern battalions focused mostly on  kidnapping-for-ransom efforts.  In 2011 and 2012, however, AQIM took advantage of the  deteriorating security situation across Libya, Mali, and Tunisia to expand its operations.   Terrorists with ties to AQIM were involved in the 2012 attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi that  killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens and three other embassy staff members.   In 2014, AQIM killed 14 Algerian soldiers in an ambush east of Algiers.    \nIn 2015, AQIM claimed responsibility for an attack on a UN vehicle in Kidal, Mali, which  wounded seven peacekeepers.  That same year, AQIM twice attacked UN convoys near  Timbuktu, Mali, with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades; three peacekeepers were killed  in another attack; six others were killed in still another attack; and AQIM, in cooperation with  other terrorist groups, attacked the Radisson Blu Hotel in Bamako, Mali, taking more than 170  hostages, including U.S. citizens.  As many as 27 people were killed in this last attack, among  them a U.S. international development worker.    "}

Since the end of 2006, al-Shabaab and associated  militias have engaged in violent insurgency using guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics against  the transitional governments of Somalia.  \nAl-Shabaab is an official al-Qa’ida (AQ) affiliate and has ties to other AQ affiliates, including al- Qa’ida in the Arabian Peninsula and al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb.  The group’s leader is  Ahmed Diriye, aka Ahmed Umar, aka Abu Ubaidah.  \nAl-Shabaab is composed of Somali recruits and foreign terrorist fighters.  Since 2011, al- Shabaab has seen its military capacity reduced owing to the efforts of the African Union Mission  in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali forces, and clashes within the group itself.  Despite al- Shabaab’s loss of urban centers since 2012, the group has maintained its hold on large sections  of rural areas throughout Somalia and has conducted attacks in Somalia, Kenya, Uganda, and  Djibouti.

The term “‘non-combatant,” which is referred to but not defined\nin 22 USC 2656f(d)(2), is interpreted to mean, in addition to civilians, military personnel\n(whether or not armed or on duty) who are not deployed in a war zone or a war-like setting.\n\nIt should be noted that 22 USC 2656f(d) is one of many U.S. statutes and international legal\ninstruments that concern terrorism and acts of violence, many of which use definitions for\nterrorism and related terms that differ from those used in this report. The interpretation and\napplication of defined and related terms concerning terrorism in this report are therefore specific\nto the statutory and other requirements of the report, and not intended to express the views of the\nU.S. government on how these terms should be interpreted or applied for any other\n\npurpose. Accordingly, there is not necessarily any correlation between the interpretation of\nterms such as “non-combatant” for purposes of this report and the meanings ascribed to similar\nterms pursuant to the law of war (which encapsulates the obligations of states and individuals\nwith respect to their activities in situations of armed conflict).\n\nStatistical Information.
