The survey was  conducted by interviewers under the direction of SSRS. A combination of landline and cell  phone random digit dial samples were used; both samples were provided by Marketing Systems  Group. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish. Respondents in the landline sample  were selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at home.  Interviews in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that  person was an adult 18 years of age or older. Within the cell phone RDD frame, two strata were  defined: numbers flagged as a pre-paid phone and numbers not flagged as such. Numbers  servicing a pre-paid phone were sampled at a somewhat higher rate than other numbers. The  weighting procedure corrected for the different sampling rates.

The sample also is weighted to match current  patterns of telephone status (landline only, cell phone only, or both landline and cell phone),  based on extrapolations from the 2016 National Health Interview Survey. The weighting  procedure also accounts for the fact that respondents with both landline and cell phones have a  greater probability of being included in the combined sample and adjusts for household size  among respondents with a landline phone. To account for the oversample of pre-paid cell phone  sample, an adjustment was made to the data before the sample was balanced to population  parameters. The sample was adjusted so that the proportion of prepaid numbers in the entire  sample matched the proportion of prepaid numbers in the base sample.
