This specific type of scam is generally referred to as\nthe Nigerian scam because of its prevalence in the country. Such schemes typically involve\npromising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front\npayment, which the fraudster claims to require in order to cover the cost of documentation,\ntransfers, etc. Frequently, the sum is said to be lottery proceeds or personal/family funds being\nmoved out of a country by a victim of an oppressive government, although many types of\nscenarios have been used. This scheme is perpetrated globally through email, fax, or mail.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT): Collective\nterm used to describe the overall legal, procedural, and enforcement regime countries must\nimplement to fight the threats of money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nBearer Share: A bearer share is an equity security that is solely owned by whoever holds the\nphysical stock certificate. The company that issues the bearer shares does not register the owner\nof the stock nor does it track transfers of ownership. The company issues dividends to bearer\nshareholders when a physical coupon is presented.\n\nBlack Market Peso Exchange (BMPE): One of the most pernicious money laundering\nschemes in the Western Hemisphere. It is also one of the largest, processing billions of dollars’\nworth of drug proceeds a year from Colombia alone via TBML, “smurfing,” cash smuggling, and\nother schemes. BMPE-like methodologies are also found outside the Western Hemisphere.\nThere are variations on the schemes involved, but generally drug traffickers repatriate and\nexchange illicit profits obtained in the United States without moving funds across borders. In a\nsimple BMPE scheme, a money launderer collaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or\nVenezuela to provide him, at a discounted rate, U.S. dollars in the United States. These funds,\nusually drug proceeds, are used to purchase merchandise in the United States for export to the\nmerchant. In return, the merchant who import the goods provides the money launderer with\nlocal-denominated funds (pesos) in Colombia or Venezuela. The broker takes a cut and passes\nalong the remainder to the responsible drug cartel.\n\nBulk Cash Smuggling: Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals\naccumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity. Smuggling, in the context of bulk\ncash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one\ncountry to another.\n\nCross-border currency reporting: Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a\ncurrency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of\ncash and other negotiable monetary instruments.\n\nCounter-valuation: Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders. One of\nthe parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring\nvalue to another party and/or offsetting debt owed.\n", "vlm_text": "Definitions   \n419 Fraud Scheme:   An advanced fee fraud scheme, known as “419 fraud” in reference to the  fraud section in Nigeria’s criminal code.

There are variations on the schemes involved, but generally drug traffickers repatriate and  exchange illicit profits obtained in the United States without moving funds across borders.  In a  simple BMPE scheme, a money launderer collaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or  Venezuela to provide him, at a discounted rate, U.S. dollars in the United States.  These funds,  usually drug proceeds, are used to purchase merchandise in the United States for export to the  merchant.  In return, the merchant who import the goods provides the money launderer with  local-denominated funds (pesos) in Colombia or Venezuela.  The broker takes a cut and passes  along the remainder to the responsible drug cartel.    \nBulk Cash Smuggling:   Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals  accumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity.  Smuggling, in the context of bulk  cash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one  country to another.    \nCross-border currency reporting:   Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a  currency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of  cash and other negotiable monetary instruments.  \nCounter-valuation:   Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders.  One of  the parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring  value to another party and/or offsetting debt owed.  "}

For example, in 2018, DEA offered a one-day  money laundering course for Ecuadorian National Police officers/commanders, prosecutors, and  personnel from the FIU.  \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  \nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) provides training and/or technical assistance to  national law enforcement personnel globally.  Training and technical assistance programs  enhance host country law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute narcotics-related  money laundering crimes.  The FBI has provided workshops introducing high-level money  laundering techniques used by criminal and terrorist organizations.  The training may focus on  topics such as a foundational understanding of drug trafficking investigative and analytical  techniques and tactics, money laundering and public corruption, or terrorism financing crimes  and their relationship to drug trafficking as a support for terrorism activities.

The GNU should continue to improve seizure and confiscation procedures in cases\ninvolving narcotics and drug trafficking and should work with international partners to implement\nprocedures for money laundering seizures.\n\nAlbania\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Government of Albania made no significant progress toward thwarting money laundering\nand financial crimes in 2018. Albania remains vulnerable to money laundering due to\ncorruption, growing organized crime networks, and weak legal and government institutions. The\ncountry has a large cash economy and informal sector, with significant money inflows from\nabroad in the form of remittances. Major proceeds-generating crimes in Albania include drug\ntrafficking, tax evasion, and smuggling. Other significant predicates include counterfeiting, arms\nsmuggling, and human trafficking. Smuggling is facilitated by weak border controls and\ncustoms enforcement. Albania serves as a base of operations for organized crime organizations\noperating in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. Recent justice\nreforms, vetting of judges and prosecutors for corruption and ties to organized crime, and the\ncreation of a police task force targeting organized crime activities have created a positive\ntrajectory for Albania to address money laundering and financial crimes.

Albania remains vulnerable to money laundering due to  corruption, growing organized crime networks, and weak legal and government institutions.  The  country has a large cash economy and informal sector, with significant money inflows from  abroad in the form of remittances.  Major proceeds-generating crimes in Albania include drug  trafficking, tax evasion, and smuggling.  Other significant predicates include counterfeiting, arms  smuggling, and human trafficking.  Smuggling is facilitated by weak border controls and  customs enforcement.  Albania serves as a base of operations for organized crime organizations  operating in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, and South America.  Recent justice  reforms, vetting of judges and prosecutors for corruption and ties to organized crime, and the  creation of a police task force targeting organized crime activities have created a positive  trajectory for Albania to address money laundering and financial crimes.  These efforts, however,  are still challenged by pervasive corruption.    \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nNarcotics trafficking or smuggling and illegal business dealings of organized crime gangs are the  major sources of illicit funds.

The Tri- Border Area (TBA) shared with Brazil and Paraguay is one of the principal routes into Argentina  for multi-billion dollar counterfeiting, drug trafficking, TBML, and other smuggling offenses.    The terrorist organization Hizballah has significant financing operations in the TBA.  Although  moving in the right direction, Argentina has important progress to make   in implementing  adequate mechanisms to effectively prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering  and related crimes.   \nUnder President Macri, Argentina has taken significant steps to strengthen its AML/CFT regime.   In 2018, the government advanced several high-profile anti-corruption prosecutions that have  boosted public confidence in AML/CFT enforcement in the country.  Despite these positive  steps, limited regulatory and criminal enforcement capabilities continue to raise concerns about  the government’s ability to significantly reduce the flow of illicit proceeds and combat the  predicate offenses that generate them.   \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nContraband smuggling, including narcotics trafficking, and public corruption are significant  sources of illicit proceeds.  Drug-related crimes have increased in Argentina in the last decade,  and Argentina is no t  only a transit country but also a consumer and exporter of narcotics and  precursors.  Tax evasion and the sale of counterfeit goods also generate significant amounts of  revenue.  TBML schemes also have been detected.   \nVarious sectors of the economy are vulnerable to exploitation due, in part, to the lack of effective  regulatory oversight.  Financial institutions, both state and private, MVTS businesses, exchange  houses, real estate, and gaming are particularly susceptible.  Unregulated exchange houses still  operate, although Argentina abolished its official exchange rate, making the unofficial rate  offered less attractive.  Argentina also lacks adequate controls at points of entry to prevent cross- border transport of contraband and bulk cash.

The majority of foreign investment\nand international trade in Azerbaijan continues to be in the energy sector. Azerbaijan’s\ngovernment is working to diversify the economy away from energy by prioritizing investments\nin agriculture, tourism, trade logistics, telecommunications, and information technology. The\neconomic realities of a weak currency and a poorly supervised financial sector, coupled with\nAzerbaijan’s physical location between Iran and Russia, create an environment conducive to the\ntransit of illicit funds.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nThe major source of criminal proceeds in Azerbaijan continues to be public corruption across all\nsectors and agencies within the government. In addition, the Afghan drug trade generates\nsignificant illicit funds, some of which transit Azerbaijan. Robbery, tax evasion, smuggling,\ntrafficking, and organized crime also generate illicit funds. Money laundering likely occurs in\nthe financial sector, including in non-bank financial entities and alternative remittance systems.\nAzerbaijan also possesses a significant black market for smuggled goods for sale domestically\nand is a transit point for smuggled cargo.\n\nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nThe key Azerbaijani AML law is the 2009 “Law on the Prevention of Legalization of Criminally\nObtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism” (AML/CFT Law).\nSubsequently in 2009, in order to bring existing legislation into compliance with this law, the\n“Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Changes and Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of\nthe Republic of Azerbaijan in Connection with Implementation of the AML/CFT Law” was\nadopted. In 2010, the “Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Amendments to Individual\nLegislative Acts of the Republic of Azerbaijan to Enhance the Prevention of the Legalization of\nCriminally Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism” was adopted,\namending the Criminal Code and the AML/CFT Law.

The majority of foreign investment  and international trade in Azerbaijan continues to be in the energy sector.  Azerbaijan’s  government is working to diversify the economy away from energy by prioritizing investments  in agriculture, tourism, trade logistics, telecommunications, and information technology.  The  economic realities of a weak currency and a poorly supervised financial sector, coupled with  Azerbaijan’s physical location between Iran and Russia, create an environment conducive to the  transit of illicit funds.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nThe major source of criminal proceeds in Azerbaijan continues to be public corruption across all  sectors and agencies within the government.  In addition, the Afghan drug trade generates  significant illicit funds, some of which transit Azerbaijan.  Robbery, tax evasion, smuggling,  trafficking, and organized crime also generate illicit funds.  Money laundering likely occurs in  the financial sector, including in non-bank financial entities and alternative remittance systems.   Azerbaijan also possesses a significant black market for smuggled goods for sale domestically  and is a transit point for smuggled cargo.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nThe key Azerbaijani AML law is the 2009 “Law on the Prevention of Legalization of Criminally  Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism” (AML/CFT Law).   Subsequently in 2009, in order to bring existing legislation into compliance with this law, the  “Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Changes and Amendments to Some Legislative Acts of  the Republic of Azerbaijan in Connection with Implementation of the AML/CFT Law” was  adopted.  In 2010, the “Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan on Amendments to Individual  Legislative Acts of the Republic of Azerbaijan to Enhance the Prevention of the Legalization of  Criminally Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism” was adopted,  amending the Criminal Code and the AML/CFT Law.  Amendments to the AML/CFT Law in  July 2018 name the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS), the FIU, as the supervisor of  pawnshops and persons providing intermediary services for the purchase and sale of real estate.    \nThe FMS was established as a new independent FIU on May 25, 2018.  The FIU structure was  further clarified in July 2018 via amendments to Azerbaijan’s AML/CFT Law.  Previously, FMS  had been part of the Financial Markets Supervisory Authority (FMSA).   "}

Most of the\ncriminal proceeds laundered in Belgium are derived from foreign criminal activity but are\nheavily associated with the recent boom in cocaine importations at the Port of Antwerp. Bulk\ncash smugglers, the principal money laundering concerns of law enforcement, move European\ndrug proceeds out of the region. For the most part, the bulk cash only transits Belgium but is not\ndeposited due to strong banking controls. Illicit funds, however, do enter the banking system.\nThe National Bank of Belgium estimates the total amount of illicit funds currently in circulation\nat $2.80 billion.\n\nBelgium is a leader in the diamond trade.

Bulk cash smugglers move European drug\nproceeds out of the region, primarily using hawala networks in conjunction with currency\nexchange houses located throughout the world.\n\nDrug proceeds are occasionally laundered by the purchase of loose diamonds and/or diamond\njewelry, which couriers then take out of Belgium. The opaque and closed nature of the Antwerp\ndiamond industry inhibits money laundering investigations and provides a cover for some\nindividuals to launder illicit funds through pre-existing, pseudo-legitimate networks.\n\nVirtual currencies, such as bitcoin, are increasingly used by criminal networks to facilitate illegal\nactivity in Belgium. Fueled primarily by the sale of synthetic drugs via the dark web,\ninvestigations involving virtual currency are becoming more common among Belgian police\nauthorities.\n\nThe total number of licensed casinos is limited to nine. There continues to be steady growth in\ninternet gaming. The extent of internet gaming activity is unknown.\n\nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS\nBelgium has comprehensive KYC rules and STR requirements.

For the most part, the bulk cash only transits Belgium but is not  deposited due to strong banking controls.  Illicit funds, however, do enter the banking system.   The National Bank of Belgium estimates the total amount of illicit funds currently in circulation  at  $\\S2.80$   billion.    \nBelgium is a leader in the diamond trade.  Officials note that the high value and easy transport of  diamonds makes them highly vulnerable to money laundering through both illicit sales and as a  means of storing and transmitting value.  Diamonds are an ideal vehicle for TBML due to the  lack of a set market value.    \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   \nLarge amounts of illicit funds generated by the cocaine trade fuel a shadow economy in Belgium.   Drug trafficking through the Port of Antwerp generates proceeds that are laundered from  Belgium through intermediary points such as the United States, UAE, or Hong Kong.   Legitimate businesses, such as real estate, restaurants, diamonds, and retail businesses are used  to launder drug proceeds.    \nDifficulties in monitoring movements in the Port of Antwerp and limited investigations into  passengers repeatedly declaring more than approximately   $\\S10{,}925$   (€10,000) at the main airport  of Zaventem facilitate the movement of cash.  Bulk cash smugglers move European drug  proceeds out of the region, primarily using hawala networks in conjunction with currency  exchange houses located throughout the world.    \nDrug proceeds are occasionally laundered by the purchase of loose diamonds and/or diamond  jewelry, which couriers then take out of Belgium.  The opaque and closed nature of the Antwerp  diamond industry inhibits money laundering investigations and provides a cover for some  individuals to launder illicit funds through pre-existing, pseudo-legitimate networks.   \nVirtual currencies, such as bitcoin, are increasingly used by criminal networks to facilitate illegal  activity in Belgium.  Fueled primarily by the sale of synthetic drugs via the dark web,  investigations involving virtual currency are becoming more common among Belgian police  authorities.  \nThe total number of licensed casinos is limited to nine.  There continues to be steady growth in  internet gaming.  The extent of internet gaming activity is unknown.  \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nBelgium has comprehensive KYC rules and STR requirements.  On September 18, 2017,  Belgium published implementing legislation for the EU Fourth AML directive, which addresses  enhanced due diligence for domestic PEPs.  "}

Many illegal casinos operate in the informal market.    \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nBolivia passed several laws that control the entry and exit of foreign exchange and which  criminalize illicit gains.  In 2012, Bolivia created the National Council to Combat Illicit  Laundering of Profits to issue guidelines and policies to combat money laundering.  In 2013,  Bolivia created new regulatory procedures that allow for freezing and confiscation of funds and  other assets related to money laundering.  "}

Additionally, foreign nationals from Europe, South America, and Asia have used automated  teller machines in Dominica to skim money from European bank accounts by exploiting security  deficiencies.    \nThe preliminary vulnerabilities identified by the NRA are inadequate AML training for the  judiciary and the prosecutorial authorities, lack of awareness of new AML/CFT procedures by  key law enforcement agencies, and ineffective supervision of DNFBPs.

Identification of customers for purposes  of KYC remains challenging, as many of the publicly owned identity verification databases (such  as the Electoral Commission and Immigration database) are not available online, and those that  are available online are not updated regularly  \nFinancial crimes are prosecuted by attorneys from the Attorney General’s Office and by non- attorney police prosecutors.  Few investigators and prosecutors have received specialized AML  training.  Ghana has no certified financial crime investigators trained in asset forfeiture.  \nGhana’s Financial Intelligence Center (FIC), its FIU, and international partners trained law  enforcement agencies and other stakeholders.  Covered institutions across the banking,  insurance, and capital market sectors also receive AML/CFT awareness training.  Ghana is  "}

However, the law is not implemented effectively, as evidenced by frequent  changes in leadership, fear of reprisal at the working level, rumored intervention from the  Executive, and the failure of judges to follow through by investigating, scheduling, and referring  cases to prosecutors.   \nUCREF has continued to build its internal capabilities, but the May 2017 UCREF law led to the  replacement of the UCREF director general and the movement of UCREF under the control of  the Executive branch, thereby reducing UCREF’s independence.  UCREF forwarded six cases to  the chief prosecutor in 2017, and six cases in 2018.

Legislative Decree N. 92,  which entered into effect on July 5, 2017, extends financial oversight into the precious metal  trade, building on other efforts to better monitor online money exchanges and online gaming  sites.  \nItaly has a MLAT with the United States and is party to the U.S.-EU MLAT.   \nItaly is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf- gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-Italy-2016.pdf.   \nAML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   \nRegulations require financial institutions to apply enhanced CDD measures for transactions with  both domestic and foreign PEPs.  However, DNFBPs are not required to apply enhanced CDD  when dealing with domestic PEPs.  DNFBPs also are not legally required to file a STR when the  beneficial owner is not identified in a business transaction.  Although the overall reported STR  data was positive, the overall percentage of STRs reported by DNFBPs decreased by half, and 21  percent of the reports were voluntary disclosures.  The government plans to continue to  implement measures that will significantly increase the number of STRs from DNFBPs.   \nENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  \nThe criminalization of self-money laundering, which allows for expanded legal authority to  prosecute individuals for money laundering, has increased convictions and has acted as a  deterrent to some extent.  However, penalties applied to persons convicted of money laundering  may not be sufficiently dissuasive as there are numerous repeat offenders.   \nIn November 2017, the UIF launched a new information-sharing database in collaboration with  the Judicial Authority.  The UIF reports access to underlying transaction data is quicker and is  increasing as a result of the new system.  The UIF is in the process of developing, in  "}

The Office of the Director of  Public Prosecutions has used ancillary provisions in the POCAMLA to apply for orders to  restrain, preserve, and seize proceeds of crime in Nairobi.  In 2016, the judiciary established the  Anti-Corruption and Economic Crimes Division in the High Court.   \nIn March 2017, Kenya enacted the Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering  (Amendment) Act 2017.  The legislation includes new legal sanctions for economic crimes and  measures to identify, trace, freeze, seize, and confiscate crime proceeds.  Persons can be fined up  to (approximately  $\\mathbb{S}47{,}400$   (5 million Kenyan shillings), and corporate bodies up to  approximately   $\\mathbb{S}237{,}100$   (25 million Kenyan shillings), with up to approximately  $\\S94{,}900$   in  additional fines for failure to comply.  It also establishes an Assets Recovery Agency to handle  all cases of recovery of crime proceeds.   \nExtradition between the United States and Kenya is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition  Treaty.  The United States and Kenya do not have a bilateral MLAT; however, Kenya is party to  relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal assistance provisions.   The U.S. and Kenya also can make and receive requests for assistance on the basis of domestic  laws.  "}

These laws impose AML/CFT requirements on all financial  institutions, including currency exchangers, money transmitters, casinos, pawnshops, and  property agents.  The laws postulate STR requirements for solicitors, accountants, and dealers in  precious metals, gems, luxury vehicles, and other high value goods.  Effective May 2017, laws  2/2006 and 3/2006 widen the scope of identifiable criminal offenses to include smuggling and  drug trafficking and strengthen CDD measures to identify and verify the identity of beneficial  owners.

Morocco’s 2016 AML/CFT national risk  assessment (NRA), though limited in scope, incorporated all reporting entities and is expected to  lead to the development of a national AML strategy.   \nMoney laundering vulnerabilities in Morocco stem from a large informal sector, the prevalence  of cash-based transactions, a high volume of remittances, and international trafficking networks.   Morocco is an integration point for illicit drug money into the legitimate economy, with  hundreds of millions of euros laundered through Morocco yearly.  Although exact figures are  unavailable, a large percentage of this money is believed to be linked to the hashish trade.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nThe informal business sector and Moroccans’ tendency to transact in cash present regulatory  challenges.  The Moroccan Central Bank (BAM) reported the ratio of the informal economy to  GDP averaged 31 percent between 2007 and 2016.    \nSince its launch in July 2017, Islamic banking in Morocco has grown and could have a market  share of 10 percent by 2022, with growth mostly from new customers.  BAM and the  telecommunications regulator are now launching mobile banking to encourage electronic (and  more easily traceable) payments.  \nMoney transfer services present a money laundering vulnerability due to their volume.  Annual  remittance transfers rose 5.7 percent to   $\\S66.1$   billion in 2017.  The majority of transfers originate  in Europe.  The Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (UTRF), the FIU, now requires transfer  operators to collect identification information on both senders and recipients abroad.  \nMorocco’s geographical location as a gateway to Europe makes it an attractive conduit for  smuggling, human trafficking, and illegal migration.  The anti-trafficking in persons law seeks to  deter trafficking and money laundering with heavy sentences for offenders and a broad definition  of trafficking to include anyone who gives or receives payments or benefits related to trafficking.

Nicaragua’s geography and  limited border control in remote regions leaves it vulnerable to cross-border movement of  contraband and criminal activity.  Money laundering also occurs via traditional mechanisms such  as real estate transactions, sale of vehicles, livestock farming, money transfers, lending, and  serial small transactions.    \nThere is evidence of informal “cash and carry” networks for delivering remittances from abroad.   Subject matter experts believe the black market for smuggled and stolen goods in Nicaragua is  larger than officially recognized.  Market vendors deal in cash.  The existence of multiple,  nontransparent, quasi-public businesses that manage large cash transactions and have ties to the  ruling party, and the proliferation of shell companies, increase the country’s vulnerability to  money laundering.  Many of these companies are subsidiaries of state-owned conglomerate  Albanisa, co-owned by the Nicaraguan state-owned oil company Petroleum of Nicaragua S.A.  (49 percent) and the Venezuelan state-owned petroleum firm, Petroleum of Venezuela S.A (51  percent).      \nThe Central America Four Agreement among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua  allows for visa-free movement of citizens of these countries across their respective borders;  however, these persons can be subject to immigration or customs inspections.  Nevertheless, this  agreement makes each participating country vulnerable to the cross-border movement of  contraband and criminal proceeds.    \nThere are 228 companies, primarily involved in manufacturing goods for export, operating   under FTZ status in Nicaragua.

The government reported some 70,000 individuals took advantage of the program.     \nPanama   \nOVERVIEW  \nPanama’s strategic geographic location; dollarized economy; status as a regional financial, trade,  and logistics hub; and favorable corporate and tax laws render it attractive for exploitation by  money launderers.  Panama passed comprehensive AML legal reforms in late 2015.  In October  2018, the OECD designated three residence-by-investment schemes in Panama as high-risk for  offshore tax evasion.  High-profile money laundering investigations, including the U.S.  Treasury’s 2016 designation of the Waked Money Laundering Organization, the “Panama  Papers” leaks linked to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, former President Ricardo  Martinelli’s 2018 arrest and extradition, and the numerous offshoot investigations linked to  bribes paid to public officials by Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht have intensified scrutiny  of Panama’s money laundering vulnerabilities.  \nPanama has demonstrated an increased commitment to fiscal transparency by becoming a  signatory to the OECD bilateral Common Reporting Standards in January 2018, and through its  participation in the Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance for Tax Matters.   \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nMoney laundered in Panama primarily comes from illegal activities committed abroad, including  drug trafficking, tax crimes, and smuggling of people and goods.  Panama is a drug  transshipment country due to its location along major trafficking routes.  Numerous factors  continue to hinder Panama’s fight against money laundering, including lack of capacity to  identify bulk cash shipments, inexperience with money laundering investigations and  "}

Peru\nshould improve its interagency coordination, such as by amending the FIU’s authorities outlined\nin Law 27693 to allow the FIU to send reports directly to the police in addition to public\nprosecutors.\n\nENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS\n\nPeru lacks investigative, prosecutorial, and judicial capacity to ensure gains made in\nstrengthening the AML regulatory framework are reflected through increased prosecutions and\nconvictions. High turnover of specialized prosecutors, poor training, a lack of expert forensic\naccountants, and corruption throughout the justice sector hinder enforcement efforts. From\nJanuary to June 2018, Peru convicted 12 individuals for money laundering, setting Peru on\ncourse to exceed prior year conviction rates. Under the prior asset forfeiture system, Peru\nattained 14 sentences since January 2018. Implementation of the new civil forfeiture law will\ncreate new specialized courts, prosecutorial offices, and investigative units; however, the\ngovernment did not provide additional funding for implementation. Justice sector operators also\nneed capacity building related to the link between corruption and money laundering in public\ncontracting, particularly as Peru prepares to handle large-scale corruption cases pertaining to the\nOdebrecht scandal.\n\nOf increased concern is the lack of regulatory enforcement and effective oversight in the small-\nscale mining sector, which the authorities identified as a sector particularly at risk for funneling\nprofits from the narcotics trade. For example, state-owned company Activos Mineros since 2012\nhas contracted to purchase gold from Minerales del Sur, Veta de Oro, and E&M Company,\nwhich are now under investigation for buying illegally-mined gold from small scale miners. The\ngovernment struggles to implement its formalization policy to obtain greater oversight of the\nsmall-scale gold mining sector.\n\nPhilippines\nOVERVIEW\n\nThe Philippines faces elevated AML/CFT risk due to its physical location within international\ntrafficking routes, the high volume of remittances from Filipinos living abroad, the presence of\nterrorist organizations, and its regulatory vulnerabilities that were exploited by hackers in the\n2016 Bangladesh Bank Heist. In response to these risks, the Philippine Anti-Money Laundering\nCouncil (AMLC) has led a government-wide effort to bring Philippine laws and regulations up to\ninternational AML/CFT standards. Under the well-regarded leadership at the AMLC, the\ngovernment continues work to minimize risks in key areas (including the gaming sector and\nDNFBPs) and to build the capacity of law enforcement, prosecutors, and the courts in order to\nsuccessfully prosecute financial crime cases.\n\nThe government must now demonstrate if these measures have reduced the potential for money\nlaundering in the Philippines.\n\n157\n", "vlm_text": "The regulatory framework is generally strong and the government is receptive to  recommendations from donors and international experts regarding potential improvements.  Peru  should improve its interagency coordination, such as by amending the FIU’s authorities outlined  in Law 27693 to allow the FIU to send reports directly to the police in addition to public  prosecutors.    \nENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  \nPeru lacks investigative, prosecutorial, and judicial capacity to ensure gains made in  strengthening the AML regulatory framework are reflected through increased prosecutions and  convictions.  High turnover of specialized prosecutors, poor training, a lack of expert forensic  accountants, and corruption throughout the justice sector hinder enforcement efforts.  From  January to June 2018, Peru convicted 12 individuals for money laundering, setting Peru on  course to exceed prior year conviction rates.  Under the prior asset forfeiture system, Peru  attained 14 sentences since January 2018.  Implementation of the new civil forfeiture law will  create new specialized courts, prosecutorial offices, and investigative units; however, the  government did not provide additional funding for implementation.  Justice sector operators also  need capacity building related to the link between corruption and money laundering in public  contracting, particularly as Peru prepares to handle large-scale corruption cases pertaining to the  Odebrecht scandal.        \nOf increased concern is the lack of regulatory enforcement and effective oversight in the small- scale mining sector, which the authorities identified as a sector particularly at risk for funneling  profits from the narcotics trade.  For example, state-owned company Activos Mineros since 2012  has contracted to purchase gold from Minerales del Sur, Veta de Oro, and E&M Company,  which are now under investigation for buying illegally-mined gold from small scale miners.  The  government struggles to implement its formalization policy to obtain greater oversight of the  small-scale gold mining sector.   \nPhilippines   \nOVERVIEW  \nThe Philippines faces elevated AML/CFT risk due to its physical location within international  trafficking routes, the high volume of remittances from Filipinos living abroad, the presence of  terrorist organizations, and its regulatory vulnerabilities that were exploited by hackers in the  2016 Bangladesh Bank Heist.

The expected introduction of crypto currencies will require proper AML  regulation of such exchanges.    \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nUzbekistan made progress toward meeting international standards by implementing the 2017  currency convertibility reform, the 2017 law “On combating corruption,” and the 2017-2018  State Anti-Corruption Program.  The convertibility reform effectively eliminated the black  market exchange rate and reduced unofficial markets and unofficial channels for remittances.    \nThe Law on Combating Legalization of Proceeds Obtained through Crime and Financing of  Terrorism is Uzbekistan’s core AML legislation establishing comprehensive KYC and STR  regulations, including for legal persons.  This law designates the FIU, under the Office of the  Prosecutor General (PGO), as the key governmental body responsible for AML enforcement.  A  2016 amendment allows for asset freezes and suspension of transactions if transaction parties  appear on a list of individuals/legal entities involved or suspected of involvement in proliferation  of weapons of mass destruction.  It also names the FIU as the body responsible for maintaining  this list.  In 2017, the FIU issued internal control procedures for commercial banks and credit  institutions governing the suspension of transactions and freezing of funds or other assets and  introducing enhanced due diligence for domestic PEPs.  In 2018, the President transformed the  FIU into the PGO Department on Economic Crimes with a broader mandate, including  corruption and money laundering crimes.   "}
