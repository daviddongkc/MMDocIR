For commercial and consumer card loans, the  expected credit loss is estimated using quantitative methods  that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss  experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as  an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss  forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward  looking information through the use of macroeconomic  scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These  macroeconomic  scenarios  include  variables  that  have  historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in  credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,  unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product  levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are  chosen and the amount of weighting given to each scenario  depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events,  leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third- party economists and industry trends. Also included in the  allowance for loan losses are qualitative reserves to cover  losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,  may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or  the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation  considers include changes in lending policies and procedures,  business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,  portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due  loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such  as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among  others.

This  guidance  states  that  loan  modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan  payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that  were granted to borrowers who were current as of the  implementation date of a loan modification program or  modifications granted under government mandated modification  programs, are not TDRs.

Interchange fees are recognized upon  settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions  and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit  cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the  corresponding payment network’s rates. Substantially all card  fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain  time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over  12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that  are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance  for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards  and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders  are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be  redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel  and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based  on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The  liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation  also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are  based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven  by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part  of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner  provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit  card partner’s members or customers on behalf of the  Corporation.

Home equity loans are evaluated using  CLTV, which measures the carrying value of the Corporation’s  loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding  senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of  the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score  measures the credit worthiness of the borrower based on the  financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit  history.

The Corporation’s ALM activities  maintain an overall interest rate risk management strategy that  incorporates the use of interest rate contracts to manage  fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The  Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that  movements in interest rates do not have a significantly adverse  effect on earnings and capital. The weighted-average rates are  the contractual interest rates on the debt and do not reflect the  impacts of derivative transactions.
