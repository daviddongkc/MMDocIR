Each group has numbers and dots next to them:\n\n- White: 57 and 81\n- Black: 75\n- Hispanic: 71 (two occurrences)\n- Asian*: 88\n\nThe red and blue dots and numbers seem to indicate different data points for each group.\nThe image appears to be a data visual, likely a bar chart, showing numerical values for different racial or ethnic groups. Specifically, it shows numbers for White (35, 85), Black (78), Hispanic (51, 78), and Asian* (89). These numbers are laid out along horizontal lines with corresponding colored dots, with red indicating one value and blue indicating another. Without more context, it's difficult to determine what these numbers signify, but they could represent data points like percentages, scores, or indices specific to these groups.\nPEW RESEARCH CENTER  "}

Respondents could  choose to receive the post-paid incentive in the form of a check or a gift code to Amazon.com or  could choose to decline the incentive. Incentive amounts ranged from   $\\S5$   to   $\\S{20}$   depending on  whether the respondent belongs to a part of the population that is harder or easier to reach.  Differential incentive amounts were designed to increase panel survey participation among groups  that traditionally have low survey response propensities.  \nData collection protocol  \nThe data collection field period for this survey was April 5 to April 11, 2021. Postcard notifications  were mailed to all ATP panelists with a known residential address on April 5, 2021.    \nOn April 5 and April 6, invitations were sent out in two separate launches: Soft launch and Full  launch.
