One key  element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due  to portfolio diversification or hedging activities. However,  VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not  limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors,  which may not be accurate predictors of future market  conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme  market events that are outsized relative to observed historical  market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results  beyond the   $95\\%$   confidence interval; and reporting of losses  in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions  that cannot be liquidated or hedged in one day.

Many pricing models do not entail material  subjectivity as the methodologies employed do not  necessitate significant judgment since model inputs may  be observed from actively quoted markets, as is the case  for generic interest rate swaps, many equity, commodity  and foreign currency option contracts, and certain CDS. In  the case of more established derivative products, the  pricing models used by the Firm are widely accepted by  the financial services industry. \n\n • More complex OTC derivative products are typically less  liquid and require more judgment in the implementation of  the valuation technique since direct trading activity or  quotes are unobservable.
