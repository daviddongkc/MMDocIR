Civil society and media serve as watchdogs to expose corruption, efforts which can contribute to holding public   sector actors accountable. In a rapidly developing information environment that   provides new potential for propaganda and mis-, dis-, and mal-information, a healthy   civil society and an independent media serve as the protectors of evidence-based knowledge and decision-making. Nurturing the development of and strengthening the   capacity of both sectors is increasingly important to balance the information landscape;   to strengthen citizen-government relationships; to ensure meaningful participation   across gender, race, ethnicity, disability, and religious and other aspects of identity and   communities; to promote and protect the rights of minorities and underrepresented groups; and to advance inclusive and equitable governing systems.

In some countries, civic and journalistic work is inherently dangerous,  putting individual activists and professionals at great physical and psychological risk,  online and offline.  PRC efforts to capture local markets through overt and covert  information manipulation activities are increasingly successful and moving beyond  traditional strongholds within diaspora communities. All these trends are not only  corrosive to democracy, but also create an environment that can enable bad actors to  exploit tensions that further marginalize underrepresented groups and communities.  To  address these challenges, we are bolstering efforts to support resilient, viable civil  society and independent media capable of promoting and defending democracy,  holding governments accountable, and combating propaganda and mis-, dis- and mal­ information.
