Operating profit  performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, partially offset by net revenue  growth and productivity savings. \nThe charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit  performance by 7 percentage points. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further  information. Additionally, higher inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges  included in “Items Affecting Comparability” and unfavorable foreign exchange each negatively impacted  operating profit performance by 2 percentage points.

However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace\ndamaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality\nand freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace\ndamaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated\ndamaged and out-of-date products.

Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at\nspecified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder\nof the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.\n\nIn 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-\ntax settlement charge in the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) of $205 million ($158\nmillion after-tax or $0.11 per share).\n\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for\nsalaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to\nparticipate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an\nemployer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee\ncontribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee\ncontributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is\nexpected to decrease by approximately $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated\nexpenses.\n\nIn 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that\nresulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I\n(Plan I) and to a newly created plan, the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective\nJanuary 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization will\nfacilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities\nto reduce risk and volatility.

As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected\nto increase approximately $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense.\n\nIn 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the\nobligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees.

Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum\npayments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of\n$273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).\n\nSee “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n55\n", "vlm_text": "\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.  \nPension and Retiree Medical Plans \nOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees.  Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings.  Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical)  if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at  specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder  of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. \nIn 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre- tax settlement charge in the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) of   $\\S205$   million   $(\\S158$  million after-tax or   $\\S0.11$   per share). \nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for  salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to  participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an  employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee  contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee  contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is  expected to decrease by approximately   $\\S70$   million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated  expenses. \nIn 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that  resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I  (Plan I) and to a newly created plan, the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective  January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization will  facilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities  to reduce risk and volatility. No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax expense is expected from this  reorganization. \nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of  certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected  to increase approximately  $\\S45$   million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense.  \nIn 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the  obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a  pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of   $\\S220$   million (  $\\mathbb{S}170$   million after-tax or  $\\S0.12$   per share).  \nAlso in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans  were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the  participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of  $\\S53$   million  (\\$41 million after-tax or  $\\S0.03$   per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum  payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of   $\\S273$   million   $\\mathfrak{S}211$   million after-tax or   $\\S0.15$   per share).  \nSee “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our primary performance obligation  (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the  shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred.  Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for  as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded  in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of  our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes  assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions. \nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not  allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove  and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the  product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products  is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for  anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. We recorded   $\\S20$   million of reserves for product returns in  2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.   See Note 1 for further information. "}

Land  is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service.  • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries  – Financial statements of foreign  subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and  liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting  from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other  comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted  \nIn 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment  model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to  estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain  other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally  results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter  of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or  disclosures. On initial recognition, we recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained  earnings of   $\\S34$   million (\\$44 million pre-tax) as of the beginning of 2020. \nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted  \nIn 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily  addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of  accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a  separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment,  including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the  income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes.  The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the  guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a  material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. \nNote 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges \nA summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows: \nThe table presents financial data related to productivity plans and restructuring and impairment charges over three years—2020, 2019, and 2018.

Significant  auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic  factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these  indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s  forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the  selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.  \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We  evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the  critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s indefinite-lived assets  impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term  growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also  evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the  assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to  accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We  compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data  and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and  knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by  comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including  projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and  (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.
