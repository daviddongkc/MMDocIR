"}
{"page": 23, "image_path": "page_images/2023555925_23.jpg", "ocr_text": "The majority of the STF followed the reasoning of Minister of the Supreme Court Ayres Britto\n(retired), who concluded that the provisions of the Biosafety Law do not represent contempt or\ndisregard for frozen embryos, which are unviable biologically or for the purposes for which they\nare intended, but rather the “valorization of fraternal constitutionalism.” The majority held that\nthe Federal Constitution does not provide for the beginning of human life or define the precise\nmoment at which it begins; rather, it deals with a person’s individual rights and guarantees.\n“Thus, a pre-implanted embryo is an asset to be protected, but not a person in the\nbiographical sense.”°\n\nThe decision emphasizes that the Biosafety Law does not authorize the removal of embryos from\nthe female body. Therefore, it is not a question of termination of a pregnancy, but of an embryo\nresulting from an in vitro fertilization procedure, to be discarded.*!\n\nAnother point highlighted in the decision is respect for the fundamental right to family planning,\nwhich involves the principles of human dignity and responsible motherhood and fatherhood.\nFrom this perspective, the option of a couple or a woman to opt for the artificial fertilization\nprocess does not entail a legal duty to use all embryos that are eventually formed and that are\ngenetically viable. In the same sense, the process of in vitro fertilization does not imply the duty\nto attempt to implant all the fertilized eggs in the woman’s body (nidation). Admitting this\nobligation would be to treat women in an inhuman and degrading way.\n\nThus, for the majority, for the full right to life of the in vitro fertilized embryo to be recognized, it\nwould be necessary to recognize the “right to a uterus, which is not authorized by the\nFederal Constitution.”\n\nC. Ethics in the Use of Stem Cells\n\nA medical article published in 2019 discusses the ethics involved in the use of stem cells and the\nenactment of the Biosafety Law. The article highlights arguments in favor and against such use\nand the difficulty in determining the status of the embryo. That is, whether the embryo is a human\nbeing or not. The article affirms that the benefits derived from the use of stem cells are undeniable,\nbut their ethical use is still an issue because the beginning of life has yet to be determined.\nMoreover, the indiscriminate use of such a technique could lead to a dehumanization of life,\nmaking it relatively normal to shorten life. According to the authors, these issues justified the\nneed for the promulgation of the Biosafety Law.\n\n60 Td.\n6 Id.\n2 Id.\n8 Id.\n\n64 Danielle P.

Therefore, it is not a question of termination of a pregnancy, but of an embryo  resulting from an in vitro fertilization procedure, to be discarded.   \nAnother point highlighted in the decision is respect for the fundamental right to family planning,  which involves the principles of human dignity and responsible motherhood and fatherhood.  From this perspective, the option of a couple or a woman to opt for the artificial fertilization  process does not entail a legal duty to use all embryos that are eventually formed and that are  genetically viable. In the same sense, the process of in vitro fertilization does not imply the duty  to attempt to implant all the fertilized eggs in the woman’s body (nidation). Admitting this  obligation would be to treat women in an inhuman and degrading way.   \nThus, for the majority, for the full right to life of the in vitro fertilized embryo to be recognized, it  would be necessary to recognize the “right to a uterus, which is not authorized by the  Federal Constitution.” 63   \nC.  Ethics in the Use of Stem Cells  \nA medical article published in 2019 discusses the ethics involved in the use of stem cells and the  enactment of the Biosafety Law.  The article highlights arguments in favor and against such use  and the difficulty in determining the status of the embryo. That is, whether the embryo is a human  being or not. The article affirms that the benefits derived from the use of stem cells are undeniable,  but their ethical use is still an issue because the beginning of life has yet to be determined.  Moreover, the indiscriminate use of such a technique could lead to a dehumanization of life,  making it relatively normal to shorten life. According to the authors, these issues justified the  need for the promulgation of the Biosafety Law.    "}

This law also delineates the conditions governing tissue\nprocurement and cell isolation procedures.\n\nNotably, Decree No. 39986-S of 2016 specifies that no authorization is necessary for progenitor\ncell transplants sourced from peripheral blood or hematopoietic cell transplants derived from\numbilical cord blood when employed in treatment of specific medical conditions. These\nconditions include acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic or myeloid\nleukemia, Hodgkin’s lymphoma or non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, severe aplastic anemia,\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, immune system diseases, hemoglobinopathies and\nhereditary metabolic diseases, multiple myeloma, and certain solid tumors.”\n\nAdditionally, Decree No. 39986-S of 2016 stipulates that stem cell therapy subjected to more than\nminimal manipulation requires an authorization by the interested party that wants to provide\nthis service. To obtain authorization, the interested party must submit a written application to the\nrelevant government agency, accompanied by evidence of completed preclinical studies,\ndemonstrating that it is effective and safe for use in clinical practice.
