The student should meet with the Thesis Advisory Committee (TAC) at least once every 6 months or once every  semester. There should be  a minimum of 2 TAC meetings prior to the PQE , and there should be a  final meeting no  later than 3 months prior to the submission of the thesis .   3. The student or Chair of the TAC may call for the TAC meetings on a  regular  basis as indicated in (2) above, but  meetings may be held more frequently if the student is known to be having problems  4. It is strongly advisable to have all TAC members, including supervisor and co-supervisor (if applicable) present at all  TAC meetings. If this is not possible, at least  two-thirds of the  TAC members must be present  per  meeting. The student  must seek input from those absent after the meeting at their earliest availability, with the supplementary meetings duly  documented.   5. The Chair of the TAC has to complete an Online TAC Report Form after the meeting.  Note that the form (Click  HERE )  is only accessible to the Chair of the TAC.  Therefore,  ONLY  the  Chair of the TAC  may access the form, to fill and  submit it.   Note: The Chair of the TAC may have up to 2 weeks (from the date of the TAC Meeting) to complete the  submission of the form .  6.   The Chair of the TAC should communicate the discussion and comments of the meeting to the student.  To do that, the  Chair of the TAC can download a PDF copy of the TAC Report and email it to the student for his/her reference.     7. The outcome of the meetings may be incorporated into the student's 6-monthly online progress reports in January and  August of every year, by the main supervisor on behalf of the TAC members.  8.  The Chair of the TAC should inform ISEP of any cases of serious project related or personal difficulties encountered by  the student, so that additional oversight and assistance could be provided.    9. PhD Qualifying Examinations   a.  If a student fails to apply for the PhD Qualifying Exam (PQE) by 18-24 months into his/her PhD programme,  a TAC meeting should be convened immediately to determine the reasons for this  b.  In cases where the student has made little or no progress with the thesis project by the 18-20-month mark,  and the student appears to be at risk of not obtaining a PhD, the TAC will refer the student’s case to ISEP.
