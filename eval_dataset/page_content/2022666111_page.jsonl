During the COVID-19 pandemic,  the Ontario provincial government, and other provincial governments throughout Canada, relied  on such provisions to legally underpin their pandemic response.  \nThe federal role in emergency management is usually quite limited. The federal Emergency  Management Act (EMA) entrusts the federal Minister of Public Safety with “exercising leadership  relating to emergency management in Canada by coordinating, among government institutions  and in cooperation with the provinces and other entities, emergency management activities.” 2   This includes planning for the use of federal resources in an emergency, the provision of financial  assistance to provinces and territories in an emergency, assuring the continuity of the Canadian  government in an emergency, promoting emergency management standards, and assisting  foreign countries in responding to emergencies.  It also specifically allows for the establishment  of joint emergency management plans with the United States in order to coordinate Canada’s  assistance to the United States in emergency situations.  Notably, the EMA specifically states that  “a government institution may not respond to a provincial emergency unless the government of  the province requests assistance or there is an agreement with the province that requires or  permits the assistance.”5 "}

This effectively allowed the cabinet to govern Canada during\nwartime without the need for parliamentary approvals. The extent of these powers were\nillustrated in the Supreme Court case, Re George Edwin Gray, involving a conscientious objector\nwho was charged under the Military Service Act.

The Canadian Charter of Rights  and Freedoms (the Charter), included in the constitution was not adopted until the proclamation  of the Constitution Act, 1982.   \nD.  Introduction of the Emergencies Act  \nThe advent of the Charter, which entrenched civil liberties in the Canadian constitution, as well  as the 1981 McDonald Commission into the operation of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,  resulted in the need for reform of the War Measures Act. The McDonald Commission explained  \n[t]he October Crisis made one thing quite clear: the government had no means of bringing  emergency powers into play in a national domestic crisis other than by invoking the War  Measures Act or by enacting special legislation in Parliament. Whether or not the use of  emergency powers was justified in 1970 is not for us to decide. However, the question that  arises is whether a statute that would authorize less severe measures, with more protection  for fundamental rights and freedoms, should be available for use in similar circumstances.  In the spring of 1971, legislation was drafted dealing with civil emergencies and the  government proposed the appointment of a special joint committee of the Senate and the  House of Commons to consider the enactment of this legislation. However, the committee  was not appointed and the legislation was never introduced.   \nSpecific recommendations included increasing the role of parliament, by ensuring that each  invocation of the War Measures Act be accompanied by parliamentary approval even if  Parliament is not currently in session, and that the approval be periodically reviewed.  The  McDonald Commission also noted that fundamental rights provided in the Canadian Bill of  Rights (this being before the adoption of the Charter) should be retained even in times of crisis.  The report states that  "}
