The United States also assisted the  monitoring team with information for its research and reports.  Three individuals were de- listed, and 163 entries were amended during the year, supporting the UN 1267 Committee’s  priority to ensure due process and accurate listings.  The total figures on the list are 264  individuals and 89 entities, as of December 31.
