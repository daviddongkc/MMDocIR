It is increasingly  weaponized by authoritarian states to undermine democracy. Corruption increases the  risk that U.S. foreign assistance will be misappropriated, and U.S. attempts to address it  may run the risk of inadvertently reinforcing corrupt power structures. As part of its  longstanding leadership on this issue, the United States has ensured that the rules- based international system incorporates principles of transparency, integrity, and  accountable governance and has promoted the institution aliz ation of recognized  international standards through the adoption of legally binding treaties, political  commitments, and   best   practices. INL’s approach   to   combating   corruption   balances  prevention and enforcement, recognizes the contribution of good governance, and  empowers both internal (e.g., inspectors general) and external (e.g., legislative,  journalistic, citizen) oversight. Likewise, money laundering undermines the integrity of  the worldwide financial system and facilitates and conceals crime: all forms of  transnational organized crime share the common objectives of hiding and legitimizing  criminal proceeds, some of which are drawn upon in turn to finance further operations.  Financial facilitators obscure the proceeds of crime and corruption and returning stolen  assets and addressing regulatory vulnerabilities across jurisdictions are essential given  the rapid movement of financial assets across borders.

The plan resulted in a significant number of direct hire personnel  being reassigned duties and responsibilities as well as a reprogramming of a handful of  vacant positions to allow for career advancement. The realignment clarified roles and  responsibilities by combining three functional offices and portions of our Executive  Office into two distinct offices and two new units. The review of people and resources  will allow INL, as the second largest Foreign Assistance recipient to better design,  monitor, assess, and track the impact of our   $\\mathsf{S1.5}$   billion in programs.

This occasionally  frustrates D&I goals, both from an initial recruitment standpoint, as well as with regards  to long-range retention. Additionally, the bureau’s lack   of    human   capital strategy  contributes to adverse outcomes such as staff turn-over that demands additional  resources to train and re-hire employees. These risks will be mitigated by completing  the thorough review of our personnel, establishing roles, providing opportunities for  training, and conducting interviews of exiting employees. INL will maintain and adhere  to a Human Capital Plan and ensure that that Plan is reviewed on a routine basis.
