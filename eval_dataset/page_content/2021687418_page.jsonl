It is a freedom from\nlaws that effectively prevent members of the Australian community from communicating with each other\nabout political and government matters relevant to the system of representative and responsible\ngovernment provided for by the Constitution. Unlike the Constitution of the United States, our Constitution\ndoes not create rights of communication. It gives immunity from the operation of laws that inhibit a right or\nprivilege to communicate political and government matters.\n\n16 See West Virginia Board of Education v.

Irrespective of its origin, the  existence of the freedom of political communication in Australian constitutional law is widely  accepted by High Court justices.  The basis for this right was explained by Chief Justice Mason  in the 1992  ACTV v Commonwealth  decision, in which he emphasized the importance of freedom  of communication in representative government, and quoted the former Solicitor General of the  United States, Archibald Cox:   "}

Rather than considering what was required by the implication of\nrepresentative government, Justice McHugh looked at sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution, which\nestablish elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, and argued that these provisions require\nthat “the people have a constitutional right to convey and receive opinions, arguments and information\nconcerning matter intended or likely to affect voting in an election for the Senate or the House of\nRepresentatives.” There is a subtle difference between this approach and the approach favored by Chief Justice\nMason and Justice Gaudron in ACTV. Their Honors each found that the Constitution entrenched representative\nand responsible government, which in turn gave rise to the freedom of political communication. See ACTV v\nCommonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 138-140 (Mason CJ), 211-12 (Gaudron J). See also the judgment of Justices\nDeane and Toohey in Nationwide News v Willis (1992) 177 CLR 1, 72. For more discussion on this point, see\nAdrienne Stone, The Limits of Constitutional Text and Structure: Standards of Review and the Freedom of Political\nCommunication, 23 Melbourne U. L. Rev. 688 (1999), https:/ / perma.cc/Q3VR-3L3A.\n\n24 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 566-7:\n\n[T]he Constitution gives effect to the institution of ”representative government” only to the extent that the\ntext and structure of the Constitution establish it. . . . [T]he relevant question is not, “What is required by\nrepresentative and responsible government?” It is, ”What do the terms and structure of the Constitution\nprohibit, authorize or require?”\n\n25 The one exception to this point is Justice Steward’s judgment in the 2021 decision Libertyworks v\nCommonwealth [2021] HCA 18, https:/ / perma.cc/ DEN4-H5Wé6. At paragraph 249, Justice Steward said:\n\nit is arguable that the implied freedom does not exist. It may not be sufficiently supported by the text,\nstructure and context of the Constitution and, because of the continued division within this Court about the\napplication of the doctrine of structured proportionality, it is still not yet settled law.\n\nOther High Court justices have not endorsed this view in recent freedom of political communication cases. See\nMcCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178, 217; [2015] HCA 34, https:/ / perma.cc/2MNU-DVOQY, in which\nthe plurality states that “the constitutional basis for the freedom is well settled.”\n\n26 ACTV v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 139 (Mason CJ), quoting Archibald Cox, The Court and the\nConstitution 212 (1987).\n\n27 Unions New South Wales v New South Wales (2013) 252 CLR 530, 551.\n28 McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178.\n\nou\n\nThe Law Library of Congress\n", "vlm_text": "\nonly by uninhibited publication can the flow of information be secured and the people  informed concerning men, measures, and the conduct of government. . . .

The two-part test proceeds\nin the following steps:\n\n1. Does the legislative provision burden communication on governmental or political matters?”\n\n2. If the provision imposes such a burden, it will only be valid if it is “reasonably appropriate\nand adapted to serve a legitimate end”? in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance\nof the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government.*!\n\nWhile application of the first prong has been straightforward, High Court justices have taken\ndiverging approaches to the second element.

The Original Test in  Lange \nThis part of the report explains the test the High Court set out in  Lange , and then describes two  ways in which that test has been interpreted by current justices on the High Court.  \nIn  Lange , the Court set out a two-part test to determine whether legislation imposes an  unconstitutional burden on the freedom of political communication. The two-part test proceeds  in the following steps: \n\n \n1.   Does the legislative provision burden communication on governmental or political matters? 29\n\n \n2.   If the provision imposes such a burden, it will only be valid if it is “reasonably appropriate  and adapted to serve a legitimate end” 30  in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance  of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government.   \nWhile application of the first prong has been straightforward, High Court justices have taken  diverging approaches to the second element. While the approach of each High Court justice is  beyond the scope of this report, it will outline the approaches of the  McCloy  plurality and of  Justice Gageler.   \nThe plurality introduces a structured proportionality analytical framework to address the second  element of the  Lange  test, a mode of analysis that had not previously been used in Australian  constitutional law. Although the High Court has previously utilized proportionality as a tool for  analyzing whether legislative and executive law-making powers have been exceeded,  the  structured proportionality analysis expounded by the plurality in  McCloy  was new in the  constitutional law context.
