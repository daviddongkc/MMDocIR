The icon on the left features a balanced scale with the word \"ETHICAL\" underneath, representing ethics. The icon on the right displays a padlock with the word \"SECURE\" underneath, symbolizing security. The background is a dark blue abstract pattern.\nData is responsibly collected,  stored, and utilized to provide  accountability to the U.S.  taxpayer and uphold the  highest levels of scientific and  data integrity. Implementing  leading industry standards  in ethical data capabilities  minimizes bias, fulfills the  Department’s obligations  to the U.S. people, and  models the importance of  incorporating democratic  values in technology on the  world stage. \nData is safeguarded  through industry leading  security practices at each  classification level to protect  U.S. national interests  at home and abroad. As  malicious actors seek to  gain unlawful access to  sensitive data, decisions that  advance security will remain  paramount to protecting  national security and privacy. "}
