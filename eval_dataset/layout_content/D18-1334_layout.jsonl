{"layout": 5, "type": "text", "text": "Speakers of different languages must attend to and encode strikingly different aspects of the world in order to use their language cor- rectly ( Sapir ,  1921 ;  Slobin ,  1996 ). One such difference is related to the way gender is ex- pressed in a language. Saying “I am happy” in English, does not encode any additional knowledge of the speaker that uttered the sen- tence. However, many other languages do have grammatical gender systems and so such knowledge would be encoded. In order to correctly translate such a sentence into, say, French, the inherent gender information needs to be retained/recovered. The same sentence would become either “Je suis heureux”, for a male speaker or “Je suis heureuse” for a fe- male one. Apart from morphological agree- ment, demographic factors (gender, age, etc.) also inﬂuence our use of language in terms of word choices or even on the level of syntac- tic constructions ( Tannen ,  1991 ;  Pennebaker et al. ,  2003 ). We integrate gender information into NMT systems. Our contribution is two- fold: (1) the compilation of large datasets with speaker information for 20 language pairs, and (2) a simple set of experiments that incorpo- rate gender information into NMT for multi- ple language pairs. Our experiments show that adding a gender feature to an NMT system sig- niﬁcantly improves the translation quality for some language pairs.
