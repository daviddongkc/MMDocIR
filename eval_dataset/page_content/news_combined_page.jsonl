It moved its head-\nquarters to Singapore and de-reg-\nistered its original company in\nNanjing. It set up operations in\nIreland and Indiana, and hired\nWashington lobbyists to highlight\nits U.S. expansion plans as it pre-\n\npares for a potential initial public\noffering this year.\n\nYet the clothing retailer can’t\nshake the focus on its ties with\nChina. Along with other brands\nlike the viral social app TikTok and\nshopping app Temu, Shein has be-\ncome a target of American law-\nmakers in both parties.

The warrant, which was signed by a federal judge in Washington in January after Elon Musk took over Twitter, now called X, is the first known example of prosecu- tors  directly  searching  Mr. Trump’s  communications  and adds a new dimension to the scope of the special counsel’s efforts to investigate the former president. The  court  papers,  which emerged from an appeal by Twit- ter challenging a part of the judge’s decision to issue the war- rant, did not reveal what prosecu- tors were looking for in Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, which the tech company shut down for nearly two years soon after the at- tack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.

Charred palm trees are reduced to slender matchsticks protruding into the smoky sky. Homes are ash. Streets are deserted. “Oh, my Gosh! Unbelievable,” said Richard Olsten as he piloted a helicopter along the Maui coast on Wednesday.  “This  looks  like Baghdad or something.” \nHigh temperatures are strongly associated with an increase in sui- cides, researchers have found. Heat has been linked to a rise in violent crime and aggression, emergency room visits and hospi- talizations for mental disorders, and deaths — especially among people with schizophrenia, de- mentia, psychosis and substance use. \nHeat not only fuels feelings like irritability and anger, but also seems to exacerbate mental ill- nesses,  such  as  anxiety, schizophrenia and depression. Older adults, adolescents and peo- ple with pre-existing mental ill- nesses are particularly vulnera- ble, as are people who do not have housing or are of lower socioeco- nomic status. \nAs heat waves become more in- tense, more frequent and longer, it has become increasingly impor- tant to address the impact on men- tal health, scientists say. “It’s really only been over the past five years that there’s been a real recognition of the impact,” said Dr. Joshua Wortzel, chair of the American Psychiatric Associ- ation’s committee on climate change and mental health, which was set up just two years ago. “Our understanding of the basic biology of why this association ex- \nThe firestorm that tore through the western shores of Hawaii’s Maui island on Tuesday and con- tinued on Wednesday has killed at least six people and forced the evacuation of more than 2,000, the authorities said.

Putin of\nRussia on Monday — the first\nWestern leader to see him in per-\nson since the Ukraine invasion —\nand said he came away feeling not\nonly pessimistic about peace\nprospects but fearing that Mr.\nPutin intended to drastically in-\ntensify the brutality of the war.\n\nDescribing Mr. Putin as dismis-\nsive of atrocities in Ukraine, the\nvisiting chancellor, Karl Neham-\nmer, said it was clear that Russian\nforces were mobilizing for a large-\nscale assault in eastern Ukraine’s\nDonbas region, the next phase of a\nwar now in its seventh week.\n\n“The battle being threatened\ncannot be underestimated in its\nviolence,” Mr. Nehammer said ina\nnews conference after the 75-\nminute meeting at Mr. Putin’s res-\nidence outside Moscow that the\nvisitor described as blunt and di-\nrect.\n\nThe Austrian chancellor said he\nhad told the Russian president\nthat as long as people were dying\nin Ukraine, “the sanctions against\nRussia will stay in place and will\nbe toughened further.”\n\nThe Kremlin, playing down the\nmeeting’s significance in a terse\nstatement, said only that it was\n“not long by the standards of re-\ncent times.”\n\nEven as Mr. Nehammer was\nvisiting, Russian forces were\nbombarding Ukrainian cities and\ntowns, and President Volodymyr\nZelensky of Ukraine said “tens o!\nthousands are dead” in Mariupol,\nthe besieged southern city that\nhas been the scene of the most in-\ntense destruction of the war.\n\nAnd Mr. Putin, despite Russia’s\nmilitary blunders in the war, and\nfor all the Western efforts to ostra-\ncize him, still appeared in contro!\nof the crisis. He has severely re-\npressed any dissent and benefited\nfrom widespread domestic sup-\nport, continuing revenues from oil\nand gas sales to Europe, the im-\nplicit backing of China and the re-\n\nfusal of much of the world to join\nsanctions against Russia.\n\nMany commentators in the\nWest had criticized the Austrian\nchancellor — his country is a\nmember of the European Union\nbut not of NATO — for having vis-\nited Moscow at all, seemingly\nplaying into Mr. Putin’s narrative\nthat American-led efforts to iso-\nlate Russia would necessarily end\nin failure.\n\nMr. Nehammer told reporters\nafterward that he had tried to con-\nfront Mr. Putin with the horrors of\nwar and of the war crimes that\nRussian troops are accused of\n\n\"ALEXANDER ZEMLIANICHENKO/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nChancellor Karl Nehammer\nof Austria met with Mr. Putin.\n\nhaving committed in the Kyiv sub-\nurb of Bucha and elsewhere.

And he reserved the right\nto “change his plans at any time,\nas he deems appropriate.”\n\nIt was a promise — or perhaps it\nwas a threat. Either way, the filing\nencapsulated the treacherous sit-\nuation that Twitter now finds itself\nin.

Putin of Russia on Monday — the first Western leader to see him in per- son since the Ukraine invasion — and said he came away feeling not only pessimistic about peace prospects but fearing that Mr. Putin intended to drastically in- tensify the brutality of the war. Describing Mr. Putin as dismis- sive of atrocities in Ukraine, the visiting chancellor, Karl Neham- mer, said it was clear that Russian forces were mobilizing for a large- scale assault in eastern Ukraine’s Donbas region, the next phase of a war now in its seventh week. \nMany commentators in the West had criticized the Austrian chancellor — his country is a member of the European Union but not of NATO — for having vis- ited Moscow at all, seemingly playing into Mr. Putin’s narrative that American-led efforts to iso- late Russia would necessarily end in failure. \nMr. Nehammer told reporters afterward that he had tried to con- front Mr. Putin with the horrors of war and of the war crimes that Russian troops are accused of \n“The battle being threatened cannot be underestimated in its violence,” Mr. Nehammer said in a news conference after the 75- minute meeting at Mr. Putin’s res- idence outside Moscow that the visitor described as blunt and di- rect. \nThe image shows a person in a suit and tie speaking or presenting, likely at a formal event or press conference.

And the United States has long objected to any exercise of jurisdiction by the court over citizens of countries that are not part of the treaty that created it — like the United States, but also Russia. \nLVIV, Ukraine — When war came to Ukraine in February, Helen Polishchuk made some adjustments in the six-story bar she manages in central Lviv. \n“Because to say ‘have a nice day’ in this period is stupid,” said Ms. Polishchuk, 33. Before the Russian invasion of Ukraine at the end of February, Lviv, a historic city just 40 miles from Poland, was a popular European tourist destination, with 2.5 million visitors a year and the biggest jazz festival in Eastern Europe. \nThe Kremlin, playing down the meeting’s significance in a terse statement, said only that it was “not long by the standards of re- cent times.” \nEven as Mr. Nehammer was visiting, Russian forces were bombarding Ukrainian cities and towns, and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said “tens of thousands are dead” in Mariupol, the besieged southern city that has been the scene of the most in- tense destruction of the war. \nHouse in Lviv’s DISPATCH historic central square stayed open, but served coffee and hot food instead of alcoholic drinks.

Lviv and its residents are learn- ing to live with what most now believe will be many months of conflict, if not years. \nAnd Mr. Putin, despite Russia’s military blunders in the war, and for all the Western efforts to ostra- cize him, still appeared in control of the crisis.

Russia has been pouring troops and  equipment  into  eastern Ukraine, in the first stage of what Ukrainian and Western officials say will be a major push to swal- low up more of the Donbas region before Kyiv can field more power- ful armaments from the West and mount its own offensive. \nThe Friday shootdown showed Mr. Biden taking direct and force- ful action far more quickly than he did last week, when some Republi- can lawmakers criticized him for letting the spy balloon linger over the United States for several days before destroying it. But that peri- od of observation last week al- lowed American officials to collect intelligence about the spy balloon, while in the episode on Friday, of- ficials seemed unsure about what exactly they shot down. \nIn Turkey, a Web of Volunteer Medics \nIn place of demolished hospitals, a series of field clinics has sprung up, staffed by doctors and nurses from around the world.

His image-makers\ncast him as “Xi Dada,” the people’s\nfirm but genial “Uncle Xi.”\n\nHow vastly different now. A dec-\nade on, Mr. Xi looms over the\ncountry like a stern Communist\nmonarch, reflecting on China’s\nfallen ancient dynasties and de-\ntermined to win its lasting ascend-\nancy in a turbulent world.\n\nChinese officials praise his\nspeeches like hallowed texts, pro-\nfessing loyalty with a fervor that\nsometimes echoes Mao Zedong’s\nera. Privately mocking Mr. Xi can\nlead to prison. His public encoun-\nters are regimented displays of ac-\nclaim.\n\nA Communist Party congress\nopening Sunday is shaping up to\nbe Mr. Xi’s imperial moment,\nstrengthening and extending his\nrule, while also intensifying the\nlong-term hazards from his singu-\nlar dominance. At the meeting in\nBeijing, he seems sure of winning\nathird term as the party’s general\nsecretary, breaking with recent\nexpectations that Chinese leaders\nwould reign for around a decade.\n\n“The certainty will really only\nbe in the arrangements at the top-\nmost level, that his power is be-\nyond challenge, but beneath that\nwe'll face a great many uncertain-\nties,” Wu Qiang, a political analyst\nin Beijing, said in an interview.\n\nThe evolution of Mr. Xi’s public\nface has paralleled his transfor-\nmation of China into a proudly au-\nthoritarian state, scornful of criti-\ncism from Washington, increas-\ningly sure that Western democra-\ncy has lost its allure, and\nimpatient for a bigger say in shap-\ning the 21st-century global order.\n\nThe party congress will be Mr.\nXi’s stage to demonstrate that he\nremains undaunted, despite the\nrecent economic malaise, Covid\noutbreaks and increasing animos-\nity with the United States, which\nhas labeled China a national secu-\nrity threat.

His image-makers cast him as “Xi Dada,” the people’s firm but genial “Uncle Xi.” \nLONDON — Government lead- ers in the West are struggling with rising inflation, slowing growth, and anxious electorates worried about winter and high energy bills. But Liz Truss, Britain’s prime minister, is the only one who devised an economic plan that unnerved financial markets, drew the ire of global leaders and the public and undermined her po- litical standing. \nHow vastly different now. A dec- ade on, Mr. Xi looms over the country like a stern Communist monarch, reflecting on China’s fallen ancient dynasties and de- termined to win its lasting ascend- ancy in a turbulent world. \nChinese officials praise his speeches like hallowed texts, pro- fessing loyalty with a fervor that sometimes echoes Mao Zedong’s era. Privately mocking Mr. Xi can lead to prison. His public encoun- ters are regimented displays of ac- claim. \nOn Friday, battered by savage criticism, she retreated. Ms. Truss fired her top finance official, Kwasi Kwarteng, for creating pre- cisely the package of unfunded tax cuts, billion-dollar spending programs and deregulation that she had asked for. \nA Communist Party congress opening Sunday is shaping up to be Mr. Xi’s imperial moment, strengthening and extending his rule, while also intensifying the long-term hazards from his singu- lar dominance. At the meeting in Beijing, he seems sure of winning a third term as the party’s general secretary, breaking with recent expectations that Chinese leaders would reign for around a decade. “The certainty will really only be in the arrangements at the top- most level, that his power is be- yond challenge, but beneath that we’ll face a great many uncertain- ties,” Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing, said in an interview. \nShe reinstated a scheduled in- crease in corporate taxes to 25 percent from 19 percent, a rise she had previously opposed. That an- nouncement came on top of back- tracking last week on her proposal to eliminate the top 45 percent in- come tax on the highest earners.

Her victory was widely ex-\npected, but the margin was less\nresounding than the polls fore-\ncast, suggesting she may face\nproblems pulling together a party\nshaken by Mr. Johnson’s turbulent\nthree-year tenure and a country\nrattled by an energy crisis and the\naftershocks of Brexit.\n\nMs. Truss, who served as for-\neign secretary in Mr. Johnson’s\ncabinet and was not part of the\nTory rebellion that led to his de-\nparture, will formally assume the\nprime minister’s title on Tuesday\nina meeting with Queen Elizabeth\nII at Balmoral Castle in Scotland,\nwhere the queen spends her sum-\nmer holiday.\n\nMs. Truss will be Britain’s\nfourth prime minister in the six\nyears since it voted to leave the\nEuropean Union, and only its third\nfemale leader, after Margaret\nThatcher and Theresa May. Like\nthem, she will be greeted by a for-\nbidding array of problems.\n\nDouble-digit inflation, a loom-\ning recession, labor unrest, soar-\ning household energy bills and\npossible fuel shortages this winter\n— all will confront Ms. Truss as\nshe moves into 10 Downing Street.\nShe also faces a potential collision\nwith the European Union over her\nlegislation to change trade rules in\nNorthern Ireland, a dispute that\ncould spill over into Britain’s rela-\ntions with the United States,\nwhich opposes any kind of disrup-\ntive change.\n\nIn a brief, businesslike speech\nto members of her party after her\nvictory was confirmed, Ms. Truss\npromised a “bold plan” to lower\ntaxes and revive the economy. “I\ncampaigned as a Conservative,\nand I will govern as a Conserva-\ntive,” she declared. “We will de-\nliver, we will deliver and we will\ndeliver.”\n\nCritics said Ms. Truss’s call for\ntax cuts and smaller government\nwas inadequate in the face of the\ndire economic threats bearing\ndown on Britain. Many expect her\n\nContinued on Page Al0\n\n© 2022 The New York Times Company\n\nNEW YORK, TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 6, 2022\n\nA Hawkish Political Disrupter\nTo Lead a Nation Facing Crisis\n\nBy MARK LANDLER\n\nLONDON — As apassionate 19-\nyear-old student at Oxford in 1994,\nElizabeth Truss called for a refer-\nendum to abolish the British mon-\narchy, telling an audience of fellow\nLiberal Democrats, “We do not be-\nlieve that people should be born to\nrule.”\n\nThree decades later, Ms. Truss,\nnow 47 and known as Liz, will\ntravel to a Scottish castle on Tues-\nday to be anointed by Queen Eliza-\nbeth II as Britain’s new prime\nminister, completing a political od-\nyssey from rabble-rousing repub-\nlican to tradition-cloaked leader of\nthe Conservative Party.\n\nMs. Truss long ago pivoted to\nembrace the monarchy as being\ngood for British democracy, just\nas she long ago abandoned the\nLiberal Democrats for the Conser-\nvatives.

Trump’s handling of sensitive government records, ordering the appoint- ment of an independent arbiter to review a trove of materials seized last month from Mr. Trump’s pri- vate club and residence in Florida. The judge, Aileen M. Cannon of the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida, also temporarily banned the Justice Department from using the seized materials for any “investigative purpose” connected to its inquiry of Mr. Trump until the work of the arbiter, known as a special master, was completed. \nMs. Truss, 47, defeated Rishi Sunak, a former chancellor of the Exchequer, whose resignation in July set in motion Mr. Johnson’s ouster. Her victory was widely ex- pected, but the margin was less resounding than the polls fore- cast, suggesting she may face problems pulling together a party shaken by Mr. Johnson’s turbulent three-year tenure and a country rattled by an energy crisis and the aftershocks of Brexit. \nMs. Truss, who served as for- eign secretary in Mr. Johnson’s cabinet and was not part of the Tory rebellion that led to his de- parture, will formally assume the prime minister’s title on Tuesday in a meeting with Queen Elizabeth II at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, where the queen spends her sum- mer holiday. \nThe order would prevent, at least for now, federal prosecutors from using key pieces of evidence as they continue to investigate whether the former president ille- gally retained national defense documents at his estate, Mar-a- Lago, or obstructed the govern- ment’s repeated efforts to get them back. \nOne Million Migrants Admitted Into U.S. During Biden’s Tenure \nA Hawkish Political Disrupter To Lead a Nation Facing Crisis \nMs. Truss will be Britain’s fourth prime minister in the six years since it voted to leave the European Union, and only its third female leader, after Margaret Thatcher and Theresa May.

How well it will prepare her for the rigors of the job is another ques- tion, given the dire economic trends enveloping the country, and a Tory party that seems torn between desire for a fresh start and regret about tossing out her flamboyant, larger-than-life pred- ecessor, Boris Johnson. \n— all will confront Ms. Truss as she moves into 10 Downing Street. She also faces a potential collision with the European Union over her legislation to change trade rules in Northern Ireland, a dispute that could spill over into Britain’s rela- tions with the United States, which opposes any kind of disrup- tive change. \nThey are among the more than one million undocumented immi- grants who have been allowed into the country temporarily after crossing the border during Presi- dent Biden’s tenure, part of a record-breaking cascade of irreg- ular migration around the world. Distinct from the hundreds of thousands who have entered the country undetected during Mr. Bi- den’s term, many of the one mil- lion are hoping for asylum — a long shot — and will have to wait seven years on average before a decision on their case is reached because of the nation’s clogged immigration system. \nThree decades later, Ms. Truss, now 47 and known as Liz, will travel to a Scottish castle on Tues- day to be anointed by Queen Eliza- beth II as Britain’s new prime minister, completing a political od- yssey from rabble-rousing repub- lican to tradition-cloaked leader of the Conservative Party. \nIndeed, in her order, issued on the Labor Day holiday, Judge Can- non said she had made her deci- sions   $\\mathrm{\\textmu_{t0}}$   ensure at least the ap- pearance of fairness and integrity under the extraordinary circum- stances.” Her order would not, however, affect a separate review of the documents by the Office of the Director of National Intelli- gence seeking to determine what risk to national security their re- moval to Mar-a-Lago may have caused. \nBy her own admission, Ms. Truss has little of Mr. Johnson’s charisma.

More  recently,  she switched sides on Brexit, oppos- ing the drive for Britain to leave the European Union before the 2016 referendum, then reversing course to become one of its most ardent evangelists. \nWhile immigration is among the country’s most hotly debated political issues, the focus is almost always on the surging numbers of people seeking to cross the south- western border.

The City\nCouncil bought about 17,000 acres\nof farmland 60 miles to the north,\nnear Fort Collins, along with the\nassociated water rights. When the\ntime was right, Thornton would\ndivert the water from the Cache la\nPoudre River that irrigated that\nfarmland, put it in a pipeline and\nsend it downstate.\n\n“In the water business you have\nto be years and years ahead of the\ngame,” Mr. Ethredge, now retired,\nsaid in an interview.\n\nIn theory, Thornton’s water\nwoes were solved.

How\nholding the city might fit in with\nits broader plans was less clear.\n\nEven before Ukraine stepped\nup its attack on Russians in\nBakhmut on the weekend, its\nforces had moved to beat Russian\ntroops back from the last main\nhighway into the city.

Ron DeSantis of Florida has made it his political mission to, as he likes to say, put points on the board. \nTwo radiologists had previously said the X-ray did not show any signs that the patient had breast cancer. But Dr. Ambrózay was looking closely at several areas of the scan circled in red, which arti- ficial intelligence software had flagged as potentially cancerous. “This is something,” she said. She soon ordered the woman to be called back for a biopsy, which is taking place within the next week. Advancements in A.I. are be- ginning to deliver breakthroughs in breast cancer screening by de- tecting the signs that doctors miss.

Hungary, which has a robust breast cancer screening program, is one of the largest testing grounds for the technology on real patients. At five hospitals and clin- ics that perform more than 35,000 screenings a year, A.I. systems were rolled out starting in 2021 and now help to check for signs of cancer that a radiologist may have overlooked. Clinics and hospitals in the United States, Britain and the European Union are also be- ginning to test or provide data to help develop the systems.

And few coun- tries have moved as quickly as South Korea to increase output. Last year, South Korea’s arms exports rose 140 percent to a record \\$17.3 billion, including deals worth \\$12.4 billion to sell tanks, howitzers, fighter jets and multiple rocket launchers to Po- land, one of Ukraine’s closest al- lies. \nUkrainian  commanders  ac- knowledged that their forces in Bakhmut still faced the risk of en- circlement, but the fighting over the weekend showed that a mili- tary that has surprised the world with its doggedness was not yet ready to give up on Bakhmut. How holding the city might fit in with its broader plans was less clear.

And yet\nfewer than half made it to their\ntargets, Ukrainian officials say.\n\nUkraine’s success in knocking\ndown those projectiles, and the\ndeath and destruction caused\nwherever missiles slipped\nthrough, have reinvigorated calls\nby officials in Kyiv for Western\ncountries to provide more sophis-\nticated defensive weapons sys-\ntems.

But it is unclear how\nmuch money the families will ulti-\nmately collect.\n\nThe families and their lawyers\nsat in stunned silence as the court\nclerk read one by one the sums\nawarded to each of 15 plaintiffs in\nthe case. After court was ad-\njourned, they hugged one another\nquietly, weeping.\n\nThe largest award went to Rob-\nbie Parker, who received $120 mil-\nlion. For years on his Infowars\nshow and website, Mr. Jones sin-\ngled out Mr. Parker, whose daugh-\nter Emilie died at Sandy Hook, as\nan actor whose televised tribute\nto Emilie a day after her death\nwas “disgusting.”\n\nMr. Parker, who has endured\nonline abuse, harassment and\ndeath threats since, formed the\ncenterpiece of the Connecticut\ncase. “Every day in that court-\nroom, we got up on the stand and\nwe told the truth,” he said. “Telling\nthe truth shouldn’t be so hard, and\nit shouldn’t be so scary.”\n\nMr. Parker added, in a nod to\nMr. Jones’s followers, “For any-\nbody that still chooses to listen to\nthat man, just ask yourself, what\nhas he ever given you?”\n\nIn all likelihood Mr. Jones does\nnot have the money to pay\nWednesday’s award. In August a\nforensic economist estimated that\nMr. Jones’s empire was worth a\nmaximum of $270 million, but that\nsame month Mr. Jones put his par-\nent company, Free Speech Sys-\ntems, into bankruptcy.

And yet fewer than half made it to their targets, Ukrainian officials say. Ukraine’s success in knocking down those projectiles, and the death and destruction caused wherever  missiles  slipped through, have reinvigorated calls by officials in Kyiv for Western countries to provide more sophis- ticated defensive weapons sys- tems. At a meeting at NATO head- quarters in Brussels on Wednes- day, the United States and other allies readily agreed, pledging to rapidly provide the weaponry. \nBy ELIZABETH WILLIAMSON \nWATERBURY, Conn. — The families of eight Sandy Hook shooting victims on Wednesday won nearly \\$1 billion in damages from the Infowars fabulist Alex Jones, a devastating blow against his empire and a message from the jury that his lies and those of his followers have crippling con- sequences. \nMr. Jones, who for years said the 2012 Sandy Hook shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Conn., was a government hoax, now faces fi- nancial ruin. But it is unclear how much money the families will ulti- mately collect. \nThe families and their lawyers sat in stunned silence as the court clerk read one by one the sums awarded to each of 15 plaintiffs in the case. After court was ad- journed, they hugged one another quietly, weeping. \nunits of a missile defense system so advanced even its own forces have yet to use it. The Nether- lands promised millions of dollars in air-defense missiles, and Presi- dent Emmanuel Macron of France said his country would send “ra- dars, systems and anti-air mis- siles.” \nThe Hidden Hand Guiding Conservative Causes \nIn Long View, Biden Strategy \nThe largest award went to Rob- bie Parker, who received \\$120 mil- lion. For years on his Infowars show and website, Mr. Jones sin- gled out Mr. Parker, whose daugh- ter Emilie died at Sandy Hook, as an actor whose televised tribute to Emilie a day after her death was “disgusting.” \nMost of the initiatives were fi- nancially supported, or in some cases launched, by an opaque, sprawling network shaped by Mr. Leo and funded by wealthy pa- trons, usually through anony- mous donations that critics call “dark money.” \nMillions Flow Through  Network Assembled  by Veteran Activist \nBy KENNETH P .

SANGER \nPresident Biden declared on Wednesday that the overwhelm- ing challenge for the United States in the coming years would be “out- competing China and restraining Russia” while focusing on restor- ing a damaged democracy at home. \nMr. Parker, who has endured online abuse, harassment and death threats since, formed the centerpiece of the Connecticut case. “Every day in that court- room, we got up on the stand and we told the truth,” he said. “Telling the truth shouldn’t be so hard, and it shouldn’t be so scary.” \nAn investigation by The New York Times of Mr. Leo’s activities reveals new details of how he has built that network, with relatively little public attention, into one of the best-funded and most sophis- ticated operations in American politics, giving him extraordinary influence as he pushes a broad ar- ray of hot-button conservative causes and seeks to counter what he sees as an increasing leftward  Continued on Page A14 \nconservative groups — each with their own leadership and mission. Behind the scenes, though, these groups have something in common: They are part of an am- bitious coalition developed in re- cent years by the conservative ac- tivist Leonard A.

These  initiatives  were  ad- vanced in the past year or so by a handful of new or reconfigured \nIn his 48-page national security strategy, which every new admin- istration is required to issue, Mr. Biden made clear that over the long term he was more worried about China’s moves to “layer au- thoritarian governance with a re- visionist foreign policy” than he was about a declining, battered Russia. More than six months af- ter the invasion of Ukraine, the Russian military appears less fearsome than it did when the first drafts of the document circulated in the White House in December. “Russia and the P .R.C. pose dif- ferent challenges,” Mr. Biden wrote, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. “Russia poses an immediate threat to the free and open inter- national system, recklessly flout- ing the basic laws of the interna- tional order today, as its brutal war  of  aggression  against \nMr. Parker added, in a nod to Mr. Jones’s followers, “For any- body that still chooses to listen to that man, just ask yourself, what has he ever given you?” \nIn all likelihood Mr. Jones does not have the money to pay Wednesday’s award. In August a forensic economist estimated that Mr. Jones’s empire was worth a maximum of \\$270 million, but that same month Mr. Jones put his par- ent company, Free Speech Sys- tems, into bankruptcy.

Hos- pitals are overwhelmed with wounded patients and running out of vital supplies; fuel for gen- erators and vehicles is dwindling rapidly; food and water are grow- ing scarce; and it is not clear when humanitarian aid might be al- lowed in. \nRetaliating for the bloodiest at- tack on Israel in 50 years, Israel is pummeling Gaza with a ferocity not seen in past conflicts and has cut off vital supplies to the coastal territory. Health officials in Gaza, home to two million people, said the Israeli bombardment had killed more than 1,500 people and injured over 6,600 others. \nIsrael’s military says that it is hitting places used by Hamas, which controls Gaza, including mosques, houses and other out- wardly civilian locations. Gazans say the airstrikes are doing indis- criminate damage to civilians and civilian sites, and independent ob- servers have confirmed that schools and ambulances have been destroyed. \n“We are facing a huge disaster,” Adnan Abu Hasna, an official with the United Nations agency that aids Palestinian refugees, said by phone from Gaza.

After being narrowly nomi- nated for speaker during a Wednesday closed-door secret- ballot contest among House Re- publicans, Mr. Scalise, their No. 2 leader, found himself far from the 217 votes needed to be elected on the House floor. Many supporters of his challenger, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the right-wing Republican endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump, re- fused to switch their allegiance.

At FTX’s headquarters in the Bahamas, Mr. Bankman-Fried lived and worked with an inner circle of more than half a dozen friends, including a former lover, a confidant from high school math camp and a childhood buddy of his younger brother. At least four of those allies have turned against him and agreed to cooperate with the government, after either pleading guilty or receiving im- munity from prosecution.

A U.N. spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric, said in a statement that the evacu- ation could not be conducted “without devastating humanitar- ian consequences,” and “could transform what is already a trage- dy into a calamitous situation.” The Israeli military did not back away from the evacuation plan on Friday but softened its stance, suggesting there was no deadline, after initially saying that people should  leave  northern  Gaza within 24 hours. “We understand it will take time,” Rear Adm.

But in the years leading up to the pandemic, that condition ad- vanced  around  the  country: Springfield, Mo., stopped having enough housing.

A politicized narrative had evolved faster than reporters could accumulate information, and was fueling its own news cy- cle outside the facts. \nTwo years later, as the Supreme Court has eroded federal protec- tions on all three, Ms. Chadwick now sees President Biden and other Democratic leaders as lack- ing both the imagination and willpower to fight back. She points to a generational gap — one she once overlooked but now seems cavernous. \nShortages vs. Surpluses \n“By the simple fact that M.B.S. managed to hold onto his position domestically, he is the necessary interlocutor if you want to talk to Saudi Arabia,” said Cinzia Bianco, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \n“It was extreme enough that the questions about it were logical questions to ask,” said Kelly McBride, a media ethics expert at the Poynter Institute. But, she added, journalists needed to do the reporting to answer questions and “not just put more opinions out without any more additional facts.” \nA growing number of metro areas that once took housing affordability for granted faced shortages heading into the pandemic.

Ana-\nlysts say Wall Street’s pessimism\nis not likely to end until the major\nconcerns are resolved, and when\nthat will happen seems impossible\nto know.\n\nWhat matters most is the effect\nthat all of this will have on con-\nsumers, who account for the larg-\nest share of economic activity in\nthe United States. While con-\nsumer spending has held up for\nnow, several measures show that\ntheir confidence is eroding\nquickly, and economists expect\ndemand to slow as people face\nhigh prices and rising borrowing\ncosts at the same time.\n\n“The consumer is the main\ndriver of the U.S. economy,” said\nKathy Bostjancic, chief U.S. finan-\ncial economist at Oxford Econom-\nics. “So how the consumer goes, so\ngoes the economy.” Ms. Bostjancic\nsaid that as the Fed continued to\nraise rates this year and into next\nyear, “we see more vulnerability\nfor the consumer and risks of a\nconsumer pullback rise.”\n\nMs. Bostjancic’s firm has re-\nduced its expectations for gross\ndomestic product growth this\nyear to 3.1 percent, compared with\n5.7 percent reported for 2021. But\nthe outlook for 2023 is where con-\ncerns are particularly evident.\n\nContinued on Page A18\n\nIn Ohio G.O.P,\nBombast Prods\nGentility Aside\n\nBy JONATHAN WEISMAN\nand TRIP GABRIEL\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — Republi-\ncans running for the seat of Ohio’s\nretiring senator, Rob Portman, ap-\npear determined to bury the soft-\nspoken country-club bonhomie\nthat was once a hallmark of the\nparty in this state and replace it\nwith the pugilistic brand of con-\nservatism owned by Donald J.\nTrump and now amplified by the\nnew band of Buckeye bomb\nthrowers.\n\nThe race descended into a bru-\ntal slugfest as the leading candi-\ndates, the author-turned-venture\ncapitalist J.D.

And\nNord Stream 2, built to increase\nthat flow but abruptly shuttered in\nthe run-up to Russia’s attack on\nUkraine.\n\nThe pair of pipelines has be-\ncome a twin symbol of Germany’s\ndangerous dependence on Rus-\nsian gas — and the country’s be-\nlated and frenzied effort to wean\nitself off it — with calls growing for\nthe European Union to hit Mos-\ncow with tougher sanctions as\natrocities come to light in Ukraine.\n\nOn Tuesday, the European Com-\nmission, the E.U’s executive\nbranch, proposed banning im-\nports of Russian coal and soon,\npossibly, its oil. But Russian gas —\nfar more critical to Germany and\nmuch of the rest of Europe — was\noff the table. At least for now.\n\n“We are dependent on them,”\nsaid Axel Vogt, mayor of Lubmin,\nwhich has a population of just\n2,119, as he stood in the industrial\n\nharbor between the two pipelines\none recent morning. “None of us\nimagined Russia ever going to\nwar. Now Russia is one of our\nmain suppliers of gas, and that’s\nnot something we can change\novernight.”\n\nThat dependence on Russia —\naccounting for more than a quar-\nter of Germany’s total energy use\n—has meant that Berlin has so far\nrefused to cut off President Vladi-\nmir V. Putin, whose war it is effec-\ntively subsidizing to the tune of an\n\nContinued on Page A7\n\nHANNIBAL HANSCHKE/REUTERS\nPipes at the Nord Stream 1 gas\npipeline in Lubmin, Germany.\n\nNEW YORK, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 6, 2022\n\n= eae eae\n\nsky Chastises U.N. fo\n\n=\n\na\n\nIVOR PRICKETT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nBorodyanka, a Ukrainian commuter town near Kyiv, was among the first places to be hit by Russian airstrikes.

It was only after a while\nthat he explained something even\nworse had happened. His mother\nlived a few doors down, and her\napartment had also been bombed.\n\n“Mom’s home was hit on the\nsame day,’ Mr. Ziuzko said. “I\n\nA Kyiv Suburb Begins\nIts Grim Task Weeks\nAfter Airstrikes\n\ncan’t find her.”\n\nRussian troops recently with-\ndrew from the area around\nBorodyanka, a Ukrainian com-\nmuter town near Kyiv, the capital,\nthat was among the first places to\nbe hit by Russian airstrikes.

Putin on Monday ordered\ntroops into separatist-held east-\nern Ukraine and hinted at the pos-\nsibility of a wider military cam-\npaign, delivering an emotional\nand aggrieved address to his na-\ntion that laid claim to all of\nUkraine as a country “created by\nRussia.”\n\nAfter the speech, state televi-\nsion showed Mr. Putin at the\nKremlin signing decrees recog-\nnizing the so-called Donetsk and\nLuhansk People’s Republics,\nwhich were formed after Russia\nfomented a separatist war in east-\nern Ukraine in 2014. The decrees,\npublished by the Kremlin, di-\nrected the Russian Defense Min-\nistry to deploy troops in those re-\ngions to carry out “peacekeeping\nfunctions.”\n\nThe action by Mr. Putin, who\nhas commandeered the world’s at-\ntention with an enormous deploy-\nment of troops along Ukraine’s\nborder in recent weeks, was the\nmost blatant yet in a confrontation\nthat Western officials warn could\nescalate into the biggest armed\nconflict in Europe since World\nWar II.\n\nIt was a momentous decision\nfor Mr. Putin, a reversal of his\neight-year-old strategy to use the\nseparatist enclaves the Kremlin\nbacked with arms and money as a\nmeans of pressuring Ukraine’s\ngovernment without recognizing\nthem outright as independent\nfrom Ukraine itself.\n\nBut he continued to keep the\nworld guessing about his next\nsteps, signaling in his hourlong\n\nspeech that his goals extended be-\nyond the enclaves.

She had not previ-\nously served as any kind of judge,\nand because about 98 percent of\nfederal criminal cases are re-\nsolved with plea deals, she has\nhad only a limited opportunity to\nlearn how to preside over a trial.\n\nA Bloomberg Law database\nlists 224 criminal cases that have\nbeen assigned to her, and a New\nYork Times review of those cases\nidentified four that went to trial.\nEach was a relatively routine mat-\nter, like a felon who was charged\nwith illegally possessing a gun. In\nall, the four cases added up to 14\ntrial days.\n\nJudge Cannon’s suitability to\nhandle such a high-stakes and\nhigh-profile case has already at-\ntracted scrutiny amid widespread\nperceptions that she demonstrat-\ned bias in the former president’s\nfavor last year, when she oversaw\na long-shot lawsuit filed by Mr.\nTrump challenging the FB.I’s\ncourt-approved search of his Flor-\nida home and club, Mar-a-Lago.\n\nIn that case, she shocked legal\nexperts across the ideological di-\nvide by disrupting the investiga-\ntion — including suggesting that\nMr. Trump gets special protec-\ntions as a former president that\nany other target of a search war-\nrant would not receive — before a\nconservative appeals court shut\nher down, ruling that she never\nhad legitimate legal authority to\nintervene.\n\n“She’s both an inexperienced\njudge and a judge who has previ-\nously indicated that she thinks the\nformer president is subject to spe-\ncial rules so who knows what she\nwill do with those issues?” said Ju-\nlie O’Sullivan, a Georgetown Uni-\nversity criminal law professor and\nformer federal prosecutor.\n\nContinued on Page A16\n\n$4.00\n\nIN BID FOR TIME,\nFED ENDS STRING\nOF RAISING RATES\n\nHALT ONLY TEMPORARY\n\nPausing to Assess Effects\nof Prior Moves to Ease\nStubborn Inflation\n\nBy JEANNA SMIALEK\n\nFederal Reserve officials left in-\nterest rates unchanged on\nWednesday, skipping an increase\nafter raising rates 10 times in a\nrow since March 2022.

SCHMIDT and CHARLIE SAVAGE \nPausing to Assess Effects of Prior Moves to Ease Stubborn Inflation \nAileen M. Cannon, the Federal District Court judge assigned to preside over former President Donald J. Trump’s classified docu- ments case, has scant experience running criminal trials, calling into question her readiness to handle what is likely to be an ex- traordinarily complex and high- profile courtroom clash. \nBy JEANNA SMIALEK\nFederal Reserve officials left in- terest  rates  unchanged  on Wednesday, skipping an increase after raising rates 10 times in a row since March 2022. Still, poli- cymakers predicted that they might need to raise rates two more times this year as inflation, while moderating, remains stub- born. \nJudge Cannon, 42, has been on the bench since November 2020, when Mr. Trump gave her a life- time appointment shortly after he lost re-election. She had not previ- ously served as any kind of judge, and because about 98 percent of federal criminal cases are re- solved with plea deals, she has had only a limited opportunity to learn how to preside over a trial. A Bloomberg Law database lists 224 criminal cases that have been assigned to her, and a New York Times review of those cases identified four that went to trial. Each was a relatively routine mat- ter, like a felon who was charged with illegally possessing a gun. In all, the four cases added up to 14 trial days. \nFed officials, in their policy statement, said that they were giving themselves time to assess how the economy was reacting to what has been a rapid campaign to slow demand and wrestle fast inflation under control. The cen- tral bank had already raised rates to a range of 5 to 5.25 percent over a little more than a year. But policymakers also pre- dicted in their economic forecasts \nTrump’s Allies May Be Prosecution’s Witnesses \nDespite War, Paying Russia For Uranium \nThe image is a line graph depicting the Federal Funds Target Rate from the year 2000 onwards. The vertical axis represents the interest rate percentage from 0% to 7%, while the horizontal axis shows the timeline from the year 2000 to around 2023. The graph shows fluctuations in the rate over this period.\n\nThe graph also indicates periods of recessions with vertical blue bars. Notable trends include a peak in the early 2000s where the rate was above 6%, followed by a decline to near 0% during the financial crisis around 2008-2009. There is another significant rise starting from around 2016, peaking before declining sharply in 2020, possibly due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The rate then increases again till around the current level. The text \"No change\" appears on the graph, indicating a period where the rate remained stable.\nwho is saying what to the govern- ment as they go about their jobs. In court in Miami on Tuesday, the federal magistrate judge who handled Mr. Trump’s arraignment ordered the former president not to discuss the case with his co-de- fendant and personal aide, Walt Nauta, saying that any communi- cations about it would have to go through their lawyers. \nJudge Cannon’s suitability to handle such a high-stakes and high-profile case has already at- tracted scrutiny amid widespread perceptions that she demonstrat- ed bias in the former president’s favor last year, when she oversaw a long-shot lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump challenging the F .B.I.’s court-approved search of his Flor- ida home and club, Mar-a-Lago. In that case, she shocked legal experts across the ideological di- vide by disrupting the investiga- tion — including suggesting that \nCourt Puts Limits on Ex-President With His Inner Circle \nThis article is by  Alan Feuer ,  Mag- gie Haberman  and  Glenn Thrush .

Individ-\nuals in the United States are al-\nlowed to buy directly from Canadi-\nan pharmacies, but states have\nlong wanted to be able to purchase\nmedicines in bulk for their Medic-\naid programs, government clinics\nand prisons from Canadian whole-\nsalers.\n\nFlorida has estimated that it\ncould save up to $150 million in its\nfirst year of the program, import-\ning medicines that treat H.I.V.,\nAIDS, diabetes, hepatitis C and\npsychiatric conditions. Other\nstates have applied to the FD.A. to\nset up similar programs.\n\nBut significant hurdles remain.\nSome drug manufacturers have\nagreements with Canadian whole-\nsalers not to export their medi-\ncines, and the Canadian govern-\nment has already taken steps to\nblock the export of prescription\ndrugs that are in short supply.\n\n“Canada’s drug supply is too\nsmall to meet the demands of both\nAmerican and Canadian con-\nsumers,” Maryse Durette, a\nspokeswoman for Health Canada,\nwrote in an email message. “Bulk\nimportation will not provide an ef-\nfective solution to the problem of\nhigh drug prices in the U.S.”\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry’s\nmajor lobbying organization, the\nPharmaceutical Research and\nManufacturers of America, or\nPhRMA, which has sued over pre-\nvious importation efforts, is ex-\npected to file suit to block the Flor-\nida plan.

It will proba- bly resolve not only whether Mr. Trump may appear on the Col- orado primary ballot after the state’s top court declared that he had engaged in insurrection in his efforts to subvert the 2020 elec- tion, but it will most likely also de- termine his eligibility to run in the general election and to hold office at all. \nThe approval, issued in a letter to Florida on Friday, is a major policy shift for the United States, and supporters hope it will be a significant step forward in the long and largely unsuccessful ef- fort to rein in drug prices. Individ- uals in the United States are al- lowed to buy directly from Canadi- an pharmacies, but states have long wanted to be able to purchase medicines in bulk for their Medic- aid programs, government clinics and prisons from Canadian whole- salers. \nNot since Bush v.

Sort of. Mostly. For\nnow.\n\nAfter years in which support\nfor Israel had turned into an\nincreasingly partisan issue in\nWashington, Democratic and\nRepublican leaders in recent\ndays have generally responded\nwith broad condemnation of\nHamas and expressions of soli-\ndarity following the slaughter of\nhundreds of Israeli civilians.\n\nBut that surface unity had\nalready begun to fray around the\nedges by Monday as Israel retali-\nated with punishing airstrikes on\nGaza, cut off food and water to\nthe enclave and prepared for\nwhat may become a ground\ninvasion that could further en-\ndanger Palestinian civilians.\nSome on the left wing of the\nDemocratic Party were criticiz-\ning Israel for “apartheid” policies\noppressing Palestinians and\ncalling for an end to U.S. aid.\n\nFor the moment, such senti-\nments have been restricted to\nthe fringes of the House Demo-\ncratic caucus and have drawn\nswift rebukes from more centrist\nmembers of the party. The reali-\nty, however, is that the sympathy\nand support for Israel will be\ntested the longer the fighting\ncontinues and the more fire-\npower that Israeli forces employ,\naccording to lawmakers and\npolitical strategists. The chal-\nlenge for President Biden and his\nallies is to translate the current\noutrage at Hamas into a sus-\ntained consensus for Israel.\n\nThe sensitivity of that was\nmade clear by mixed signals sent\nby Mr. Biden’s own administra-\ntion. The State Department’s\nOffice of Palestinian Affairs\nposted a message on X, the plat-\nform formerly known as Twitter,\non Saturday pressing “all sides to\nrefrain from violence and retalia-\ntory attacks,” and the account of\nSecretary of State Antony J.\nBlinken posted a message on\nSunday encouraging Turkey’s\n“advocacy for a cease-fire.” Both\nposts were subsequently deleted\nfollowing an outcry from Israel\nsupporters who said it was too\nsoon to urge Israel to stand\ndown.\n\nBoth Mr. Biden and Mr.\nBlinken have otherwise stead-\nfastly declared that Israel has a\nright to defend itself. The admin-\nistration has begun shipping\nmilitary equipment to Israel to\nreplenish its supplies and mov-\ning American warships and\nplanes to the region to deter Iran\nor other enemies of Israel from\nescalating the fight.\n\nContinued on Page All\n\nMobilizing 360,000\nTroops as Toll\nMounts\n\nBy ISABEL KERSHNER\nand AARON BOXERMAN\n\nJERUSALEM — Israeli troops\nmostly retook control of towns\nnear the Gaza Strip from Palestin-\nian gunmen on Tuesday, four days\nafter fighters for the militant\ngroup Hamas assailed Israeli ci-\nvilians and soldiers in devastating\nattacks that killed hundreds,\nwounded thousands and put the\ngrieving country on the brink of a\nmajor military operation.\n\nThe Israeli government ap-\nproved the call-up of an additional\n60,000 reservists, officials said,\nraising the total number of mobi-\nlized soldiers over the last three\ndays to 360,000, the most in sucha\nshort period since the country’s\nfounding.

They brought him\ncoffee, platters of food and\nchanges of clothing, and wel-\ncomed him to their homes to\nwash up and get some sleep.\n\n“They were so kind, and they\njust couldn’t do enough,” said Mr.\nBrodutch, 42, an agronomist who\ngrew pineapples on Kibbutz Kfar\nAzza before the attacks on Oct. 7.\n\nTEL AVIV DISPATCH\n\n“It was Israel at its finest,’ he\nsaid. “There was a feeling of a\ncommon destiny.”\n\nThe one-man sit-in mush-\nroomed in the weeks after the\nattacks. But the sidewalks out-\nside the military headquarters\ncould not contain multitudes, and\nsome people were uncomfortable\nwith the location, which was\nassociated with anti-government\nprotests last year.\n\nSo the mass moved a block\nnorth to the plaza in front of the\nTel Aviv Museum of Art, where a\nlong rectangular table set for 234\npeople and surrounded by empty\nchairs had been installed to\nrepresent the captives. Since\nsome 110 hostages have come\nhome, half of the table has been\nreset to correspond to the condi-\n\ntions of captivity they described,\nwith half a moldy piece of pita\nbread on each plate and bottles\nof dirty water on the table in-\nstead of wineglasses.\n\nIn the months since the at-\ntacks, the plaza has continued to\nattract a steady stream of Is-\nraelis and tourists on volunteer\nmissions who want to support\nthe families. But it has also be-\ncome a home away from home\nfor the parents, adult children,\nsiblings, cousins and other rela-\ntives of hostages.\n\nAlthough it can get damp and\nchilly in Tel Aviv in the winter,\nmany have set up tents in the\nplaza, often sleeping there, keep-\ning company with the only other\npeople in the world who they say\ncan truly understand what they\nare experiencing — the family\nmembers of other hostages.\n\nContinued on Page A6\n\nSERGEY PONOMAREV FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nIna Tel Aviv square, an artist installed a 30-yard tunnel to simulate the experiences of hostages.\n\nA Tiny Isle’s Fight to Reclaim Its Domain Online\n\nBy JACOB JUDAH\n\nThe South Pacific island of Niue\nis one the most remote places in\nthe world.

The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.5 percent, back to its level from early 2020, which matched a low last seen in 1969. \nIt was not to be. The vote dragged on in a tense scene on the House floor as he remained just short of a majority. \nThe protracted fight reflected deep divisions and foreshadowed how difficult it would be to govern with  an  exceedingly  narrow G.O.P . majority and an unruly fac- tion bent on slashing spending and disrupting business in Wash- ington.

SHEAR \nWASHINGTON — President Biden told Israel’s leaders on Tuesday that they were losing in- ternational support for their war in Gaza, exposing a widening rift with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rejected out of hand the American vision for a postwar resolution to the conflict. Mr. Biden delivered the blunt assessment of America’s closest ally in the Middle East during a fund-raiser in Washington, where he described Mr. Netanyahu as the leader of “the most conserva- tive government in Israel’s his- tory,” which doesn’t “want any- thing remotely approaching a two-state solution” to the coun- try’s long-running dispute with Palestinians. \n“There is disagreement about ‘the day after Hamas,’” Mr. Netan- yahu said in a video statement posted on social media. He said he hoped the two governments could reach an agreement about what happens after the war ends, but he vowed not to allow threats to Is- rael’s population to continue. “After the great sacrifice of our civilians and our soldiers, I will not allow the entry into Gaza of those who educate for terrorism, support terrorism and finance ter- rorism,” Mr. Netanyahu said. “Gaza will be neither Hamastan \nFatah is the political faction, a rival to Hamas, that controls the Palestinian Authority, which was ousted from Gaza in 2007 but still administers parts of the West Bank. \nThe president said that Israel had support from Europe and much of the world as well as the United States, but he added that “they’re starting to lose that sup- port by the indiscriminate bomb- ing that takes place.” \nIn his remarks at the fund- raiser, Mr. Biden pledged to con- tinue that support for Israel’s ef- fort to protect itself, saying that “we’re not going to do a damn thing other than protect Israel in the process. Not a single thing.” “Without Israel as a free-stand- ing state, not a Jew in the world is safe,” he added. \nThe president’s remarks came hours  after  Mr.  Netanyahu pledged to defy weeks of Ameri- can pressure to put the Palestin- ian Authority in charge of Gaza once the fighting ends. Mr. Netan- yahu ruled out any role there for the group, which now governs Pal- estinian society in the Israeli-oc- cupied West Bank. \nZelensky Fails to Sway the G.O.P.

WASHINGTON — President Biden warned on Tuesday that Russia was celebrating American division over providing aid to Ukraine, as President Volodymyr Zelensky hit a wall of resistance from congressional Republicans during a daylong lobbying blitz in Washington. \nUntil Tuesday, the United States had largely backed Israel both in action and in rhetoric — support- ing the assault on Gaza, fending off calls for a cease-fire at the United Nations and authorizing the sale of thousands of tank \nfrom African countries, like Ivory Coast, that were once colonized by France. \n“I said, ‘Yeah, that’s why all these institutions were set up af- ter World War II, to see to it that it didn’t happen again,’” Mr. Biden  Continued on Page A9 \n“We’ve tried to rap in pure French, but nobody was listening to us,” said Jean Patrick Niambé, known as Dofy, a 24-year-old Ivo- rian hip-hop artist listening to Marla on the rooftop. “So we cre- ate words from our own realities, and then they spread.” \nUkraine be paired with tighter se- curity at the southern border, ar- guing that the migrant crisis had become a threat to national secu- rity. But even Republican support- ers of more aid for Ukraine ap- peared to have given up hope of approving it before Congress heads home for the holidays.

Putin and expressing\nhis confidence in the “firm sup-\nport” the Russian\npresident enjoyed\namong his people.\n\nThat confidence\nis now in question, after the\nWagner private military group\nwaged an insurrection in Russia\nthat has shaken Mr. Putin’s im-\nage of invulnerability. Close\nwatchers of China say that the\nmutiny, short-lived as it was,\ncould lead Mr. Xi to hedge a close\nrelationship with Russia that had\nalready exposed Beijing to global\ncriticism and threatened some of\nits interests abroad.\n\nChina views Russia as a neces-\nsary partner in challenging the\nglobal order dominated by the\nUnited States. But Mr. Putin’s\nappetite for risk — seen in his\ninvasion of Ukraine and his\nreliance on private armies — has\nforced Beijing to defend its bond\nwith Russia in the face of West-\nern pressure.\n\nMr. Xi’s long-term bet will\nwork only if Mr. Putin remains in\ncontrol to help uphold the shared\ninterests of both countries. But\nthe revolt has raised questions\nabout Mr. Putin’s authority:\nWagner soldiers faced little to no\nresistance from regular Russian\nforces as they advanced on Mos-\ncow. And Mr. Putin’s decision to\ngrant sanctuary in Belarus to\nYevgeny V.

European\nborder officials, watching aerial footage,\nprepared to witness what was certain to\nbe a heroic operation.\n\nYet the Adriana capsized and sank in\nthe presence of a single Greek Coast\nGuard ship last month, killing more than\n600 migrants in a maritime tragedy that\nwas shocking even for the world’s deadli-\nest migrant route.\n\nSatellite imagery, sealed court docu-\nments, more than 20 interviews with sur-\nvivors and officials, and a flurry of radio\nsignals transmitted in the final hours sug-\ngest that the scale of death was prevent-\nable.\n\nHELLENIC COAST GUARD, VIA REUTERS,\n\nA Greek Coast Guard handout photo\n\nshowing migrants on the Adriana.\n\nDozens of officials and coast guard\ncrews monitored the ship, yet the Greek\ngovernment treated the situation like a\nlaw enforcement operation, not a rescue.\nRather than send a navy hospital ship or\nrescue specialists, the authorities sent a\nteam that included four masked, armed\nmen from a coast guard special operations\nunit.\n\nThe Greek authorities have repeatedly\nsaid that the Adriana was sailing to Italy,\nand that the migrants did not want to be\nrescued. But satellite imagery and track-\ning data obtained by The New York Times\nshow definitively that the Adriana was\ndrifting in a loop for its last six and a half\nhours. And in sworn testimony, survivors\ndescribed passengers on the ship’s upper\ndecks calling for help and even trying to\njump aboard a commercial tanker that\nhad stopped to provide drinking water.\n\nOn board the Adriana, the roughly 750\npassengers descended into violence and\ndesperation. Every movement threatened\nto capsize the ship. Survivors described\nbeatings and panic as they waited for a\nrescue that would never come.\n\nThe sinking of the Adriana is an ex-\ntreme example of a longtime standoff in\nthe Mediterranean.

But Mr. Putin’s appetite for risk — seen in his invasion of Ukraine and his reliance on private armies — has forced Beijing to defend its bond with Russia in the face of West- ern pressure. \nHow Greece Failed a Migrant Ship \nBut the entire story of the most recent term is considerably more complicated than that of the previ- ous one, which had seemed to es- tablish an unyielding conserva- tive juggernaut characterized by impatience and ambition — and built to last. \nPerforming a Law Enforcement Operation, Not a Rescue \nMr. Xi’s long-term bet will work only if Mr. Putin remains in control to help uphold the shared interests of both countries. But the revolt has raised questions about Mr. Putin’s authority: Wagner soldiers faced little to no resistance from regular Russian forces as they advanced on Mos- cow. And Mr. Putin’s decision to grant sanctuary in Belarus to Yevgeny V. Prigozhin, the leader of the uprising, smacked of a compromise rather than the act of a strongman with consolidated power. \nThe Greek authorities have repeatedly said that the Adriana was sailing to Italy, and that the migrants did not want to be rescued. But satellite imagery and track- ing data obtained by The New York Times show definitively that the Adriana was drifting in a loop for its last six and a half hours. And in sworn testimony, survivors described passengers on the ship’s upper decks calling for help and even trying to jump aboard a commercial tanker that had stopped to provide drinking water. On board the Adriana, the roughly 750 passengers descended into violence and desperation. Every movement threatened to capsize the ship. Survivors described beatings and panic as they waited for a \nThe image shows a boat crowded with people navigating through the ocean.

Roberts Jr., who is attentive to his court’s legitimacy, than with the take-no-prisoners approach of Justice Clarence Thomas. The chief justice’s strategy — and votes — produced a fair number of liberal victories. \nBy MATINA STEVIS-GRIDNEFF \n\nFrom air and by sea, using radar, tele- phone and radio, officials watched and lis- tened for 13 hours as the migrant ship Adriana lost power, then drifted aimlessly off the coast of Greece in a slowly unfold- ing humanitarian disaster. \n“Chief Justice Roberts seems to be getting at least some of the con- servative majority back into har- ness on incremental moves,” said Pamela S. Karlan, a law professor at Stanford. \n“It makes China realize that the Putin government’s internal politics are actually quite fragile,” said Xiao Bin, a researcher for the Institute of Russian, East European and Central Asian Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. “The fragility existed before, but it has in- creased ever since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war.” China has publicly reaffirmed \nA Greek Coast Guard handout photo showing migrants on the Adriana. \nYet the Adriana capsized and sank in the presence of a single Greek Coast Guard ship last month, killing more than 600 migrants in a maritime tragedy that was shocking even for the world’s deadli- est migrant route. Satellite imagery, sealed court docu- ments, more than 20 interviews with sur- vivors and officials, and a flurry of radio signals transmitted in the final hours sug- gest that the scale of death was prevent- able. \nIndeed, the term that just ended was something of a triumph for the chief justice, who just a year ago seemed to be losing power, having failed to persuade a single colleague to join his compromise position in the case that did away with the constitutional right to abortion. \nThe sinking of the Adriana is an ex- treme example of a longtime standoff in the Mediterranean.

Even in a vast state of nearly 40 million people, most everyone was feeling the anguish, no matter where they live. \n“We’re exhausted, we’re fright- ened, we’re angry,” Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, an emergency room doctor who directs the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California, Da- vis, Medical Center, said. \nIn Northern California, a 66- year-old man was in custody after seven people were shot dead on Monday near Half Moon Bay, a coastal community known for its small, fog-draped farms and an annual pumpkin festival. Officials at the San Mateo County Sheriff’s Office said the suspect, Zhao Chunli, had been employed at one of the farms he attacked and was likely driven by workplace griev- ances. \nIn Southern California, investi- gators continued searching for a motive in the massacre on Satur- day night at a ballroom dance hall in Monterey Park, an Asian Amer- ican enclave where 11 people were killed and nine were wounded. The suspect — Huu Can Tran, 72, a former volunteer dance instructor who the authorities said may have been driven by personal animos- ities — killed himself on Sunday as the police approached his white van. \nThose tragedies, however, were only two in a series of mass shoot- ings this month in a state that, overall, has some of the nation’s lowest mortality rates from gun violence, as well as some of its toughest gun laws. Last week, in an attack that the authorities com- pared to a drug cartel-style execu- tion, six people were shot dead in rural Tulare County in California’s Central Valley, including a 16- year-old girl and her 10-month-old baby.

Two officials said the number of Abrams tanks could be about 30. \nOver the last month, Pentagon officials had expressed misgiv- ings about sending the Abrams, citing  concerns  about  how Ukraine would maintain the ad- vanced tanks, which require ex- tensive training and servicing. \nThe image shows a military tank, specifically a modern main battle tank, positioned in an industrial setting with shipping containers in the background. The weather appears to be snowy, as evidenced by the snowflakes visible in the image. The tank is painted in a tan or desert camouflage color.\nThe U.S. may send as many as 30 M1 Abrams tanks to Kyiv. \nAnd officials said it could take years for them to actually reach any Ukrainian battlefields. But Defense Secretary Lloyd J. Austin III has now come around to the view that committing to send- ing American tanks is necessary to spur Germany to follow with its coveted Leopard 2 tanks. Officials at the State Department and the White House argued that giving Germany the political cover it sought to send its own tanks out- weighed the Defense Department reluctance, the officials said. The movement toward sending the Abrams tanks, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, fol- lows a testy confrontation last week during a NATO defense chiefs meeting over the refusal by Germany’s  chancellor,  Olaf Scholz, to send the Leopards, which many military experts be- lieve could be a critical weapon in Ukrainian hands. \nGerman officials privately in- sisted that they would send the tanks, among the most advanced in the world, only if the United  Continued on Page A10 \nSHAKE-UP  Ukraine fired several top officials after allegations of government corruption.

She was\nmet by heckling, booing and vocif-\nerous chanting of the “Mar-\nseillaise,’ France’s national an-\nthem, and had to wait for several\nminutes before being able to\nspeak.\n\n“We cannot gamble on the fu-\nture of our pensions,” Ms. Borne\ntold lawmakers. “The reform is\nnecessary.”\n\nEarlier, Mr. Macron told gov-\nernment ministers, “My interest\nwould have been to go to a vote,”\naccording to the Elysée Palace,\n“but I consider that at the present\ntime the financial and economic\nrisks are too great.” He added,\n“One cannot play with the future\nof the country.”\n\nThe risk now for Mr. Macron is\nthat enacting a retirement age of\n64 without a full vote in Parlia-\nment smacks of the kind of con-\ntempt and aloofness of which he\nhas sometimes been accused.

Falls for Second Straight Quarter as the Fed Tries to Tame Inflation \nBy BEN CASSELMAN \nlost during the pandemic crisis — it’s no surprise that the economy is slowing down as the Federal Re- serve acts to bring down infla- tion,” Mr. Biden said in a state- ment issued after the release of the G.D.P . report. “But even as we face historic global challenges, we are on the right path, and we will come through this transition stronger and more secure.” \nA key measure of economic out- put fell for the second straight quarter, raising fears that the United States could be entering a \nhad already begun. Gross domestic product, ad- justed for inflation, fell 0.2 percent in the second quarter, the Com- merce Department said Thurs- day. That drop followed a decline of 0.4 percent in the first quarter. The estimates for both periods will be revised in coming months as government statisticians get more complete data. News of the back-to-back con- tractions heightened a debate in Washington over whether a reces- sion had begun and, if so, whether President Biden was to blame. Economists largely say that con- ditions do not meet the formal def- inition of a recession but that the risks of one are rising. For most people, though, a “re- cession” label matters less than the economic reality: Growth is slowing, businesses are pulling back and families are having a harder time keeping up with rap- idly rising prices. “We’re absolutely losing mo- mentum,” said Tim Quinlan, a sen- ior economist for Wells Fargo. “In- come gains at minimum have struggled to keep pace with infla- tion, and that’s what is chipping away at people’s ability to spend.” A deceleration, on its own, isn’t necessarily bad news. The Fed- eral Reserve has been trying to cool the economy in a bid to tame inflation, and the White House has argued that the slowdown is part of an inevitable and necessary transition to sustainable growth after last year’s rapid recovery. “Coming off of last year’s his- toric economic growth — and re- gaining all the private-sector jobs \nStill,  forecasters  in  recent weeks have become increasingly concerned that the Fed’s ag- gressive moves — including rais- ing interest rates three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednes- day for the second month in a row — will result in a recession. \nJerome H.

The son of Cuban immigrants, Mr. Menen- dez broke barriers for Latinos and has used his perch as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to influence presi- dents and prime ministers. \nBut those who have closely fol- lowed his career say the years he spent enmeshed in Mr. Musto’s machine also set the tone for an- other, more sinister undercurrent that now threatens to swallow it — \n‘Make Sure You Duck Behind Your Backpack’ \nNew E.U.

On the streets of San Francisco, tents are so thick that sidewalks in the Ten- derloin neighborhood have be- come “unofficial open-air public housing.” In Portland, Ore., a blaze shut down an on-ramp to the Steel Bridge for several days in March after campers tunneled through a cinder block wall and lit a camp- fire to stay warm. \nIn a surge of legal briefs this week, frustrated leaders from across the political spectrum, in- cluding the liberal governor of California and right-wing state legislators in Arizona, charged that homeless encampments were turning their public spaces into pits of squalor and asked the Su- preme Court to revisit lower court decisions that they say have hob- bled their ability to bring these camps under control. \ners across the country, and partic- ularly in the West, have sought to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic and restore normalcy in cities. In more than two dozen briefs filed in an appeal of a deci- sion on homeless policies in a southern Oregon town, officials from nearly every Western state and beyond described desolate scenes related to a proliferation of tent  encampments  in  recent years. \nThey begged the justices to let them remove people from their streets without running afoul of court rulings that have protected the civil rights of homeless indi- viduals. \n“The friction in many communi- ties affected by homelessness is at a breaking point,” the attorneys for Las Vegas, Seattle and more than a dozen other cities, as well as national municipal organiza- tions, wrote in one brief. “Despite massive infusions of public re- sources, businesses and residents are suffering the increasingly negative effects of long-term ur- ban camping.” \nHomeless-rights  advocates agreed that tent encampments were unsafe both for their vulner- able occupants and the communi- ties around them. But they said the gathering legal campaign was merely an attempt to fall back on timeworn  government  crack- downs rather than pursue the ob- vious solutions: more help and more housing. \n“They’re seeking to blame and penalize and marginalize the vic- tims rather than take the steps they haven’t found the political will to take,” said Eric Tars, the senior policy director at the Na- Continued on Page A13 \nBy ILYSSA DALY and JERRY MITCHELL \nBRANDON, Miss. — In 2014, Bryan Bailey, the sheriff of Rankin County, Miss., made what seemed like a series of routine requests of the local district attorney’s office.

Costs Higher Yet\n\nBy JEANNA SMIALEK\n\nPrices climbed at the fastest\npace in decades in the month lead-\ning up to the war in Ukraine, un-\nderlining the high stakes facing\nthe United States — along with\nmany developed economies — as\nthe conflict promises to drive\ncosts higher.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose\nby 7.9 percent through February,\nthe fastest pace of annual inflation\nin 40 years. Rising food and rent\ncosts contributed to the big in-\ncrease, the Bureau of Labor Sta-\ntistics said, as did a nascent surge\nin gas prices that will become\nmore pronounced in the March in-\nflation report.\n\nThe February report caught\nonly the start of the surge in gas\nprices that came in response to\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine late\nlast month. Economists expect in-\nflation to pick up even more in\nMarch because prices at the pump\nhave since jumped to record-\nbreaking highs. The average price\nfor a gallon of gas was $4.32 on\nThursday, according to AAA.\n\nRapidly climbing costs are hit-\nting consumers in the pocketbook,\ncausing confidence to fall and\nstretching household budgets.\nRising wages and _ savings\namassed during the pandemic\nhave helped many families contin-\nue spending despite rising prices,\nbut the burden is falling most in-\ntensely on lower-income house-\nholds, which devote a big chunk of\ntheir budgets to daily necessities\nthat are now swiftly becoming\nmore expensive.\n\nThe price burst presents a chal-\nlenge for President Biden, espe-\ncially given that November’s\nmidterm elections are fast ap-\nproaching. Democrats will need to\nbattle to retain control of Congress\nat a time when voters are feeling\nthe squeeze of higher expenses.\nOn Thursday, Mr. Biden acknowl-\nedged the pain consumers are\nfeeling from rapid inflation but\npointed a finger at President Vla-\ndimir V.

Putin on Thursday opened the\ndoor to nationalizing the assets of\nWestern companies pulling out of\nRussia and exhorted senior offi-\ncials to “act decisively” to pre-\nserve jobs.\n\nWith Russia in danger of de-\nfaulting on its sovereign debt and\nfacing a sharp contraction in its\neconomy, the West is betting that\nthe looming, generation-defining\neconomic crisis could make Rus-\nsians turn on their president. It is\nalso possible, however, that the\ncrisis could end up strengthening\nMr. Putin, validating his narrative\nthat the West is determined to de-\nstroy Russia.\n\nRussian Leader Facing\nGeneration-Defining\nEconomic Crisis\n\n“I have no doubt that these\nsanctions would have been imple-\nmented no matter what,’ Mr.\nPutin said in televised remarks on\nThursday, arguing that his inter-\nvention in Ukraine served merely\nas a pretext for the West to try to\nwreck Russia’s economy. “Just as\nwe overcame these difficulties in\nyears past, we will overcome\nthem now, too.”\n\nBut the sanctions imposed in\nthe two weeks since the invasion\n— combined with multinational\ncompanies that employ tens of\nthousands of Russians voluntarily\ndeciding to withdraw amid the\n\nglobal outrage — dwarf any other\neconomic pressure that Russia\nhas faced under Mr. Putin.\n\nWith the ruble having lost\nnearly half its value in the last\nmonth, prices of basic goods have\nrisen sharply, causing panic buy-\ning at supermarkets.

Lavrov, might lead to\neven a brief cease-fire. Mr. Lavrov\nlater told reporters that was not\neven discussed.\n\n“The broad narrative he con-\nveyed to me,” Mr. Kuleba said af-\nterward, “is that they will contin-\nue their aggression until Ukraine\nmeets their demands, and the\nleast of these demands is surren-\nder.”\n\nAcross swaths of Ukraine, the\nfighting continued and suffering\ndeepened, especially in besieged\nand bombarded cities like Mariu-\npol in the southeast and Chernihiv\nin the north.\n\nNear Kyiv, Russian forces\ngained control of the town of\nBucha and moved southwest in an\nattempt to encircle the capital.\nThey were also approaching Kyiv\nfrom the east, with heavy fighting\ninvolving a line of Russian tanks\nreported in the suburb of Brovary,\naccording to videos posted online\non Thursday.\n\nIn Mariupol, 70 bodies have\nbeen buried since Tuesday, with-\nout coffins, in a mass grave, ac-\ncording to video recorded by The\nAssociated Press, and local offi-\ncials said an airstrike that de-\nstroyed a maternity hospital on\nWednesday had killed three peo-\nple, including a child. In Chernihiv,\nresidents lacked electricity, gas\nfor cooking or warding off the win-\nter cold, or even space to bury the\ndead, said the mayor, Vladyslav\nAtroshenko.\n\n“Dozens of people have died,”\nhe said. “Dozens of multistory\nbuildings have been ruined. Thou-\nsands of people have no place to\nlive”\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky\nof Ukraine, in his latest video mes-\nsage, said the hospital bombing in\nMariupol, a port on the Sea of\nAzov, was further “proof that the\ngenocide of Ukrainians is taking\nplace.”\n\nDespite photographs of the rav-\naged hospital and victims of the\nbombing, corroborated by the\nUnited Nations, Russian officials\ndenied having hit the hospital, or\nalternatively said it had not been\nused as a hospital. Attacks on\nmedical facilities can constitute\n\nwar crimes.\nThe chief economic adviser to\nUkraine’s government, Oleg\n\nUstenko, estimated that his coun-\ntry had already suffered $100 bil-\nlion in damage since the invasion\nbegan Feb. 24. “The situation is a\ndisaster that is really much\ndeeper than somebody can imag-\nine,’ Mr. Ustenko said at a Peter-\nson Institute for International\nEconomics virtual event.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris,\nin Warsaw to meet with Polish of-\nficials, said Russians should be in-\nvestigated for war crimes in\nUkraine, though she did not name\nany individuals.

Lavrov, might lead to even a brief cease-fire. Mr. Lavrov later told reporters that was not even discussed. \nThe Consumer Price Index rose by 7.9 percent through February, the fastest pace of annual inflation in 40 years. Rising food and rent costs contributed to the big in- crease, the Bureau of Labor Sta- tistics said, as did a nascent surge in gas prices that will become more pronounced in the March in- flation report. \n“The broad narrative he con- veyed to me,” Mr. Kuleba said af- terward, “is that they will contin- ue their aggression until Ukraine meets their demands, and the least of these demands is surren- der.” \nThe February report caught only the start of the surge in gas prices that came in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine late last month. Economists expect in- flation to pick up even more in March because prices at the pump have since jumped to record- breaking highs. The average price for a gallon of gas was \\$4.32 on Thursday, according to AAA. \nAcross swaths of Ukraine, the fighting continued and suffering deepened, especially in besieged and bombarded cities like Mariu- pol in the southeast and Chernihiv in the north. \nTHE NEW YORK TIMES \nSource: Satellite images by Planet Labs \nRapidly climbing costs are hit- ting consumers in the pocketbook, causing confidence to fall and stretching household budgets. Rising  wages  and  savings amassed during the pandemic have helped many families contin- ue spending despite rising prices, but the burden is falling most in- tensely on lower-income house- holds, which devote a big chunk of their budgets to daily necessities that are now swiftly becoming \nNear  Kyiv,  Russian  forces gained control of the town of Bucha and moved southwest in an attempt to encircle the capital. They were also approaching Kyiv from the east, with heavy fighting involving a line of Russian tanks reported in the suburb of Brovary, according to videos posted online on Thursday. \nChina’s Role: Reamplifying Kremlin Lies \nPutin Threatens Takeover of Western Companies  \nglobal outrage — dwarf any other economic pressure that Russia has faced under Mr. Putin. \nRussian Leader Facing  Generation-Defining  \nBy ANTON TROIANOVSKI \nBesieged by an onslaught of sanctions that have largely un- done 30 years of economic inte- gration with the West in the space of two weeks, President Vladimir V . Putin on Thursday opened the door to nationalizing the assets of Western companies pulling out of Russia and exhorted senior offi- cials to “act decisively” to pre- serve jobs. \nWith the ruble having lost nearly half its value in the last month, prices of basic goods have risen sharply, causing panic buy- ing at supermarkets. The central bank, which has kept the Moscow stock exchange closed since the war began, has introduced new capital controls, preventing com- panies from withdrawing more than \\$5,000 in cash for the next six months. \nIn Mariupol, 70 bodies have been buried since Tuesday, with- out coffins, in a mass grave, ac- cording to video recorded by The Associated Press, and local offi- cials said an airstrike that de- stroyed a maternity hospital on Wednesday had killed three peo- ple, including a child. In Chernihiv, residents lacked electricity, gas for cooking or warding off the win- ter cold, or even space to bury the dead, said the mayor, Vladyslav Atroshenko. \nBy EDWARD WONG \nWASHINGTON — One of Rus- sia’s most incendiary disinforma- tion campaigns ramped up days ago, when its defense and foreign ministries  issued  statements falsely claiming that the Pentagon was financing biological weapons labs in Ukraine. \n“I have no doubt that these sanctions would have been imple- mented no matter what,” Mr. Putin said in televised remarks on Thursday, arguing that his inter- vention in Ukraine served merely as a pretext for the West to try to wreck Russia’s economy. “Just as we overcame these difficulties in years past, we will overcome them now, too.” \nThe price burst presents a chal- lenge for President Biden, espe- cially given that November’s midterm elections are fast ap- proaching. Democrats will need to battle to retain control of Congress at a time when voters are feeling the squeeze of higher expenses. On Thursday, Mr. Biden acknowl- edged the pain consumers are feeling from rapid inflation but pointed a finger at President Vla- dimir V . Putin of Russia, blaming his invasion of Ukraine for fueling higher gas prices. Democrats  \nWith Russia in danger of de- faulting on its sovereign debt and facing a sharp contraction in its economy, the West is betting that the looming, generation-defining economic crisis could make Rus- sians turn on their president. It is also possible, however, that the crisis could end up strengthening Mr. Putin, validating his narrative that the West is determined to de- stroy Russia. \nThen Chinese diplomats and state media organizations re- peated the conspiracy theory at news conferences in Beijing, in ar- ticles and on official social media accounts. \nRuben Enikolopov, rector of the New Economic School in Moscow.

In the background, there are several people in military uniforms, some of whom are holding rifles. The mood appears to be serious, possibly a moment of remembrance or tribute.\n“Now that Russia has made these false claims, and China has seemingly endorsed this propa- ganda, we should all be on the lookout for Russia to possibly use chemical or biological weapons in Ukraine, or to create a false flag operation using them,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening. “It’s a clear pattern.” She called the accusations “pre- posterous,” and said the United States “does not develop or pos- sess such weapons anywhere.” The State Department labeled the assertions “total nonsense” and said Ukraine has no biological  Continued on Page A12 \nDespite photographs of the rav- aged hospital and victims of the bombing, corroborated by the United Nations, Russian officials denied having hit the hospital, or alternatively said it had not been used as a hospital.

Barnes and  David E. Sanger . \nThis article is by  Michael Leven- son ,  Marc Santora  and  Valerie Hop- kins . \nRussian forces made significant gains in Ukraine on Saturday, ad- vancing into the besieged port of Mariupol, destroying an under- ground weapons depot in the west and leaving a marine barracks in ruins following one of the deadli- est rocket strikes on Ukraine’s military in the nearly month-old war. \nWASHINGTON — In the first weeks of the first major European land war of the 21st century, the United States has sent tank- killing weapons to Ukrainian forces, but not fighter jets. It is equipping embattled Ukrainian troops with lightweight “kamika- ze” attack drones, but not, at least in an obvious way, conducting an aggressive cyberwar to degrade \nfaced a worsening humanitarian crisis,  and  military  losses mounted on both sides. A senior Ukrainian military official said on Saturday that the strike on the barracks, which happened Friday in the southern city of Mykolaiv, had killed more than 40 soldiers. Separately, Russia’s Defense Ministry claimed on Saturday that it had used a hypersonic mis- sile for the first time to destroy an underground ammunition depot in the western region of Ivano- Frankivsk.  Ukraine’s  military spokesman confirmed the hit on Saturday, but said the missile type was “yet to be determined.” \nRussia’s technological advantage. The White House will commit no American or NATO planes to the skies above Ukraine, a move American officials fear could risk turning a regional war into a global conflagration, but it is pro- viding Ukraine with missiles that could accomplish the same task of destroying Russian aircraft. Such is the tenuous balance the Biden administration has tried to maintain as it seeks to help Ukraine lock Russia in a quagmire without inciting a broader conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary or cutting off potential paths to de- escalation. \nNavigating this path has led to a tangle of decisions, and some- times tortured distinctions, when it comes to what kinds of assist- ance Washington should provide, even as the situation on the ground evolves, pictures of dead civilians circulate around the globe and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine pleads with Congress and President Biden to do more to help. \nIf confirmed, the Russian mili- tary’s use of a new generation of its missiles, called Kinzhal or Dag- ger, would mark an escalation in the conflict. Hypersonic missiles are capable of flying at five times the speed of sound, according to military analysts. \nFight for Kyiv Looms as a Long, Fierce Conflict \nU.S. Isn’t Ready If Covid Surges, Scientists Warn \n“But the level of political and eco- nomic damage would be tremen- dous.” \nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine on Saturday appealed directly to Russians to support a diplomatic resolution to the war, and added a stark warning. \nMay Be Biggest Urban Battle in 80 Years \nBy ANDREW E. KRAMER \nKYIV, Ukraine — The city of Kyiv covers 325 square miles and is divided by a broad river. It has about 500,000 structures — fac- tories, ornate churches and high- rise apartments — many on nar- row, winding streets. Roughly two million people remain after exten- sive evacuations of women and children. \nFor comparison, one of the larg- est urban battles this century was the nine-month siege of Mosul, Iraq, in 2016 and 2017 to oust its Is- lamic State occupiers. Mosul cov- ers 70 square miles and had a wartime population of about 750,000 people — a fraction of the numbers for Kyiv, where the met- ropolitan area’s prewar popula- tion was 3.6 million. \nThe balancing act informs ev- ery aspect of American policy about the war, including the scope of the punishing sanctions im- posed on the Russian economy, the granularity of the battlefield intelligence provided to Ukrain- ian troops, the killing power of the weapons systems coming over the border and whether, as Mr. Bi- den did this past week, to label  Continued on Page 10 \n“I want everyone to hear me now, especially in Moscow,” Mr. Zelensky said in a video address hours after President Vladimir V.

But capturing it, military analysts say, would re- quire a furious and bloody conflict that could be the world’s biggest urban battle in 80 years. “What we are looking at in Kyiv would dwarf anything we’ve seen since World War II,” said David Kilcullen, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Australian Army who has extensively studied ur- ban combat. “If they really, really want to level Kyiv, they can,” he said of the Russian leadership. \nTo the northwest and to the east, tens of thousands of Russian troops are pressing toward the city, Ukraine’s capital, backed by columns of tanks, armored vehi- cles and artillery. Inside Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers and civilian volunteers  are  fortifying  the downtown with barriers, anti- tank mines and artillery. Kyiv remains the biggest prize \nNegotiations over a cease-fire are continuing, and a long, heated battle over Kyiv is not inevitable. Despite superior numbers and firepower,  Russia  has  not achieved a breakthrough.

They really believed that there is no army in Ukraine and that foreigners are fighting for us. They hear from the propa- ganda that Russia is at war with NATO and with the West here. They believe that they should re- move  all  weapons  because Ukraine is under the control of America and NATO. \nThe image shows three people in an interior setting. One of them is wearing a green sweater, and another individual is wearing a light blue shirt with a sequin design. The background features wooden walls, giving a cozy, cabin-like feel.

An aid package in Congress is stalled, even as agencies run out of money for tests and therapeutics. Though less than one-third of the popula- tion has the booster shots needed for high levels of protection, the daily vaccination rate has fallen to a low. \nBy MICHAEL WILSON and SARAH BLESENER \nA white-paneled truck sat mo- tionless and idling in Midtown on a recent morning, its driver wrapped up in his phone and oblivious to what was happening outside. \nI kept a diary. When I realized that day was like a day but not exactly like a day, I started writ- ing down what was going on be- cause I woke up, I didn’t know what day of the week it was. I didn’t know what date it was be- cause it seemed like it was going on for a long time even though it was a few days. \nThere  in  the  street,  Paul Slapikas was stalking his prey. Wire-thin and 81 years old, Mr. Slapikas stood in front of the truck like a lost tourist, a camera dan- gling around his neck and a map sticking out of his jacket pocket. He appeared to be deep in conver- sation on an old flip-phone — big hand gestures, a peek at a watch, a crane of the neck like he’s looking for a friend. \nWhile some Americans may never be persuaded to roll up their sleeves, experts said that health officials could be doing a lot more, for example, to get booster shots to the doorsteps of older people who have proved willing to take the initial doses. \nAnd for the first time since it began, I went out of the gate. My husband had the children in his car. I was carrying the guinea pigs. I was driving alone and cry- ing. Tanks were in people’s yards.  Equipment  scattered. One car was just a pile of metal. A bike was broken in two pieces. Gates had fallen off houses. \nOur house and garden is on 25 acres.  We  plant  vegetables there. If you go out of the house, you can see the old farm next to us. The Russians put a Grad rocket launcher in this farm. We counted how many volleys. From three to seven and some- times up to 30. It makes very scary noises — I can’t express to you how scary. It makes this sound: shooh, shooh, shooh. These rockets they fly with such force, and at night they make these red streaks. It sounds like a murderous force. \n“You use the quiet periods to do the hard work,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “You don’t use the quiet to forget.” \nAfter exactly three minutes and 10 seconds, Mr. Slapikas — a life- long New Yorker who lives a few miles away in Queens — snapped the phone shut, tapped the screen of his watch and walked away. If everything goes as it should, he just earned \\$87.50, and maybe more, for those few minutes of time, and the company that owns the truck will receive a fine of at least \\$350 that it never saw com- ing. But for now, Mr. Slapikas is off down the block, a bounty hunter jauntily seeking his next target. “Easy pickings,” said the for- \nWe saw two soldiers in uni- form lay facedown on one part of the road.

And I saw people in a shopping center buying flowers, and I overheard snippets of conversa- tion, someone saying someone had a birthday. And as I was standing in the middle of all this, I had the feeling that I was still there under occupation. And that this was a parallel reality, this was a dream. It was a very strange feeling. \nThe image shows a person wearing a mask and gloves, preparing a syringe.

The first time the Russian sol- diers came to us, they said they wanted to check the men’s docu- ments and see how many of us were in the house. They said we had to tie a white rag on the gate to show that people lived in this house. My husband’s mother did not let them in. She said, “No, we have children in the house.” \nSuddenly, I heard bangs. There are four people out on the street from our family. And four shots were fired. Bang bang bang bang. It was like my heart burst.  The  children  started screaming: “Where’s Dad?” I ran outside, then saw that both my husband and brother and husband’s parents were still talking, that they were still alive. \nWe were lucky because my husband’s mother, she found a connection.

The Reverse Happened.\n\nBy CATRIN EINHORN\nand MANUELA ANDREONI\n\nYASUNI NATIONAL PARK,\nEcuador — In a swath of lush Am-\nazon rainforest here, near some of\nthe last Indigenous people on\nEarth living in isolation, workers\nrecently finished building a new\noil platform carved out of the wil-\nderness.\n\nTeams are drilling in one of the\nmost environmentally important\necosystems on the planet, one that\nstores vast amounts of planet-\nwarming carbon. They’re moving\ngradually closer to an off-limits\nzone meant to shield the Indige-\nnous groups. It turns out that\n\nsome of the country’s largest oil\nreserves are found here, too.\n\nEcuador is short of cash and\nstruggling with debt. The govern-\nment sees drilling as its best way\nout. The story of this place, Yasuni\nNational Park, offers a case study\non how global financial forces con-\ntinue to trap developing countries\ninto depleting some of the most\nbiodiverse places on the planet.\n\nCountries like Ecuador are\n“against the wall,” said Maria Fer-\nnanda Espinosa, an Ecuadorean\ndiplomat and a former president\nof the United Nations General As-\nsembly.\n\nDrilling in this part of the rain-\nforest wasn’t Ecuador’s first\n\nUsing Oil to Ease Debt\nat Rainforest’s Cost\n\nchoice. In 2007, Rafael Correa, the\npresident at the time, proposed a\nnovel alternative that would have\nkept the oil reserves in a parcel\nhere designated as Block 43, esti-\nmated then at around a billion bar-\nrels, in the ground.\n\nUnder that plan, countries\nwould have created a fund of $3.6\nbillion, half of the oil’s estimated\nvalue, to compensate Ecuador for\nleaving its reserves untouched.\nSupporters of the idea said it\n\nwould have been a win for the cli-\nmate, for biodiversity and for In-\ndigenous rights. And, they said, it\nwould have been a precedent-set-\nting moral victory: A small, devel-\noping nation would have been\npaid for giving up a resource that\nhelped make places like the\nUnited States and Europe so\nwealthy.\n\nBut, after early fanfare, only a\npittance in contributions trickled\nin. Ecuador turned to China for\nloans, around $8 billion over the\ncourse of the Correa administra-\ntion, some to be repaid in oil.\n\nThe failure of that plan led to the\ncurrent expansion of drilling in\n\nContinued on Page 12\n\nBiden Inquiry\nPuts Spotlight\nOn Winter 717\n\nThe Frenetic Last Days\nof a Vice Presidency\n\nBy PETER BAKER\nand MICHAEL D.

DAVID GOODMAN\n\nHOUSTON — A Texas judge\ngranted a request on Thursday to\nallow an abortion despite the\nstate’s strict bans, ruling in the\ncase of a pregnant woman whose\nfetus was diagnosed with a fatal\ncondition.\n\nThe case is believed to be\namong the first attempts in the na-\ntion to seek a court-approved\nabortion since the U.S. Supreme\nCourt overturned Roe v. Wade last\nyear and allowed states to enact\ntheir own abortion restrictions.\n\nThe judge, Maya Guerra Gam-\nble of Travis County district court,\nsided with the woman, Kate Cox,\nwho is 20 weeks pregnant, and is-\nsued a temporary restraining or-\nder to permit her doctor to per-\nform an abortion without facing\ncivil or criminal penalties.\n\nThe judge, a Democrat, agreed\nwith Ms. Cox’s lawyers that the\nprocedure was necessary to pro-\ntect Ms. Cox from a potentially\ndangerous birth, and to preserve\nher future fertility.\n\n“The idea that Ms. Cox wants\ndesperately to be pregnant, and\nthis law might actually cause her\nto lose that ability, is shocking, and\nwould be a genuine miscarriage of\njustice,” the judge said at the con-\nclusion of a roughly 30-minute\nvideo hearing. “So I will be signing\nthe order, and it will be processed\nand sent out today.”\n\nThe ruling applies only to Ms.\nCox, though it represents another\nfront in an effort to force Texas,\nwhich bans most abortions from\nconception, to allow abortions un-\nder the medical exceptions to its\nprohibitions. A separate lawsuit,\nbrought by a group of Texas wom-\nen who say they were denied\nabortions under the state law,\nasks the state to clarify the condi-\ntions in which medical exceptions\nwould apply.\n\nSince the Supreme Court elimi-\nnated the federal right to abortion\nin 2022, several conservative\nstates have enacted abortion bans\nthat provide for medical excep-\ntions. In those states, women rep-\nresented by abortion rights\ngroups have sued to clarify when\nthe procedure could be per-\nformed, or to have the bans over-\nturned.\n\nThose suits were filed after\nwomen were denied abortions. In\nsome cases, the women claimed\nthat they suffered harm to their\nhealth as a result, or were forced\nto leave the state, at significant\ncost, disruption or risk, to seek\nabortions elsewhere.\n\nContinued on Page A1l5\n\n© 2023 The New York Times Company\n\nFRIDAY, DECEMBER 8, 2023\n\nPrices in Canada may be higher\n\nUkraine Carries On the Fight\n\nKyiv still hopes for further U.S. military aid, but it is racing to bolster its own capabilities and looking to other resources.

Just days\nearlier last month, his conspiracy-\nminded cousin had suggested that\nthe Covid-19 virus had been engi-\nneered to protect Ashkenazi Jews\nand Chinese people.\n\nSitting in a van in Australia,\nwhere he was on vacation, Mr.\nSchlossberg wrote a few bullet\npoints, took out his phone and re-\ncorded a harsh condemnation of\nhis cousin on Instagram. “He’s\ntrading in on Camelot, celebrity,\nconspiracy theories and conflict\nfor personal gain and fame,” Mr.\nSchlossberg said. “I’ve listened to\nhim. I know him. I have no idea\nwhy anyone thinks he should be\npresident. What I do know is his\ncandidacy is an embarrassment.”\nThen he hit the post button.\n\nMr. Schlossberg’s denunciation\nunderscored the turmoil inside\nwhat remains of Camelot.\n\nBobby, as the 69-year-old candi-\ndate is called, has become a\nsource of deep anguish among his\nmany siblings, cousins, nieces and\nnephews, one that is testing the\nbonds of what was once known as\nthe royal family of American poli-\ntics. His relatives by and large do\nnot want him to run, do not sup-\nport his campaign, disdain his\nconspiratorial musings and al-\nmost universally admire Mr. Bi-\nden, a longtime friend of the fam-\nily who keeps a bust of Robert F.\nKennedy Sr. in the Oval Office.\n\nYet even as some members of\nthe candidate’s family feel com-\npelled to speak out against his\ncampaign, others find themselves\nprofoundly pained by the airing of\ndomestic discord. They do not\nshare Bobby’s views on many is-\nsues, particularly his strident\nanti-vaccine stances, these Ken-\nnedys say, but they care for him,\ndo not want to see him hurt and do\nnot think it helps to publicly criti-\ncize him.\n\nContinued on Page Al7\n\nINTERNATIONAL A4-13\n\nBy J.

But instead of the\ntroopers leaving, they were joined\nby dozens more when Gov. Greg\nAbbott, a Republican, ordered a\nfresh deployment.\n\nNow Austin has entered an un-\ncertain and uneasy new period in\nwhich two separate law enforce-\nment agencies, with differing ap-\nproaches to policing, are patrol-\nling the streets without formal co-\nordination.

She\nis some 3,500 miles from the front,\nyet the war reverberates in her\nfamily and in her head.\n\n“My ex-husband wanted to go\nfight — he claimed it was his duty,”\nshe said. “I said, ‘No, you have an\n8-year-old daughter, and it’s a\nmuch more important duty to be a\nfather to her?”\n\n“People are dying there in\nUkraine for nothing,” she said.\n\nHe finally understood and\nstayed, she told me, with a look\nthat said: Mine is just another or-\ndinary Russian life.

I found that Homo sovi-\neticus, far from dying out, has\nlived on in modified form, along\nwith habits of subservience. So\nwith the aid of relentless propa-\nganda on state television, the old\nPutin playbook — money, myth-\nmaking and menace of murder —\nhas just about held.\n\nBut I also heard ambivalent\nvoices like Ms. Rolikova’s, along\nwith a few raised in outright dis-\nsent, especially from young peo-\nple in a country with a stark gen-\nerational divide.\n\nIt was this restiveness, this im-\npatience with the seeming inco-\nherence of the war and with the in-\nsouciance of the privileged in\nMoscow and St. Petersburg, that\nformed the backdrop to the short-\nlived revolt led by Yevgeny V.

It is a duty to society as a\nwhole to deliver the answers the\ncountry deserves and needs.”\n\nThe measure marks the first\ntime since the end of the Pinochet\nregime that the Chilean govern-\nment has tried to find those who\nwent missing — an effort that until\nnow has largely fallen to the sur-\nviving family members, mainly\nwomen, who protested, went on\nhunger strikes and took their\ncases to court.

It is a duty to society as a whole to deliver the answers the country deserves and needs.” \nMr. Ortíz, a 50-year-old profes- sor, was kidnapped in 1976 during the dictatorship of Gen.

Two people died in traf- fic accidents that the police linked to the harsh conditions. Rescuers pulled scores of people from homes that were taking on water. But the damage inflicted by Idalia, which was a Category 3 hurricane when it made landfall on Wednesday morning, could have been far worse. By a stroke of meteorological good fortune, the hurricane came ashore in a marshy and thinly populated part of Florida, southeast of Tallahas- see. \nNo one came out alive from the black site named for the street it was on: Simón Bolívar. It was little more than a house in a rural area east of the capital run by the re- gime’s intelligence agency, DINA. There were no witnesses or sur- vivors to shed light on the detain- ees’ fates. For decades, there was only deafening silence. \nThe measure marks the first time since the end of the Pinochet regime that the Chilean govern- ment has tried to find those who went missing — an effort that until now has largely fallen to the sur- viving family members, mainly women, who protested, went on hunger strikes and took their cases to court. So far, only through these judicial cases have burial sites been identified. \nMr. Ortíz was one of 1,469 peo- ple who disappeared under Chile’s military rule from 1973 to 1990.

DAVID GOODMAN\nand JACK HEALY\n\nHOUSTON — Deep rifts have\nemerged among the hundreds of\nelected district attorneys who will\nbe charged with enforcing the ex-\npanding restrictions on abortion,\ncreating a Balkanized new legal\nsystem within states that are ban-\nning the procedure.\n\nDozens of Democratic prosecu-\ntors who represent liberal pockets\nin conservative states already\nhave vowed to resist bans by re-\nfusing to bring charges against\nabortion providers. But in many\nrural areas and outlying suburbs,\nconservative prosecutors have\nsaid they will enforce their state\nbans.\n\nAn opening salvo came this\nweek, just days after the Supreme\nCourt struck down the right to\nabortion, when a prominent anti-\nabortion group in Texas urged the\npolice and prosecutors in Dallas\nand Houston to open criminal in-\nvestigations into three abortion\nclinics that the group said were\npreparing to violate the law by\nscheduling abortions.\n\n“It is your duty to uphold the\nlaw and investigate crimes,” the\ngroup, Texas Right to Life, said in\nits letter, in which it claimed to\nhave phone recordings of clinic\nemployees. “We urge you and\nyour officers to investigate this\nabortion clinic.”\n\nThe demand was quickly made\nmoot when a judge temporarily\nblocked attempts to resurrect the\nstate’s long-dormant, century-old\nabortion law in the weeks before a\nnew ban takes effect, but it\nmarked the beginning of an explo-\nsive new battle over abortion in\nAmerica: How prosecutors and\nthe police will enforce laws that\ncriminalize abortion in two dozen\nstates, some of them carrying\n\nContinued on Page A18\n\nBrazilians Tap\n\nA Black Market\nIn Abortion Pills\n\nBy STEPHANIE NOLEN\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO — Last No-\nvember, Xaiana, a 23-year-old\ncollege student in northern\nBrazil, began exchanging text\nmessages with a drug dealer in\nthe south of the country.

SHEAR\n\nMADRID — Faced with a newly\naggressive Russia, NATO leaders\non Wednesday outlined a muscu-\nlar new vision that names Mos-\ncow as the military alliance’s pri-\nmary adversary but also, for the\nfirst time, declares China to be a\nstrategic “challenge.”\n\nIt was a fundamental shift for\nan alliance that was born in the\nCold War but came to view a post-\nSoviet Russia as a potential ally,\nand did not focus on China at all.\n\nBut that was before Feb. 24,\nwhen Russian forces poured\nacross the border into Ukraine,\nand Chinese leaders pointedly did\nnot join in the global condemna-\ntion that followed.\n\n“The deepening strategic part-\nnership between the People’s Re-\npublic of China and the Russian\nFederation and their mutually re-\ninforcing attempts to undercut the\nrules-based international order\nrun counter to our values and in-\nterests,” NATO leaders said in a\nnew mission statement issued\nduring their summit in Madrid.\n\nThe announcement came on a\nday when a top U.S. intelligence\nofficial said victory in Ukraine\nwas not yet in Russia’s grasp, the\ntwo sides said they had ex-\nchanged more than 200 prisoners\nof war, and a Ukrainian official\nsaid, “There are battles every-\nwhere.”\n\nIn a flurry of steps at the sum-\nmit in Madrid, which ends Thurs-\nday, President Biden and other\nNATO leaders sought to respond\nto President Vladimir V.

And Mr. Bi- den said that Washington would deploy an Army garrison head- quarters and a field support bat- talion in Poland, the first U.S. forces permanently located on NATO’s eastern flank.

But in many rural areas and outlying suburbs, conservative prosecutors have said they will enforce their state bans. \n“We oppose certain elements clamoring for NATO’s involve- ment in Asia Pacific, or an Asia Pa- cific version of NATO based on military alliance,” said China’s ambassador to the United Na- tions, Zhang Jun. “The outdated Cold War script must not be reen- acted in Asia Pacific.

Or\nthe reality of seeing them up close\nin widely circulated photographs\nand videos.\n\nThere have been other atroci-\nties in the weeks since Russia in-\nvaded Ukraine, concentrating\nmuch of its firepower on the\ndwellings and gathering spots of\nordinary Ukrainians, but the in-\nternational outrage they pro-\nvoked has been eclipsed by the re-\naction to revelations that retreat-\ning Russian soldiers left many\nslain civilians behind near the\nUkrainian capital.\n\nSome of the bodies found this\npast weekend outside Kyiv were\nface down, and some curled up. Ci-\nvilians appear to have been killed\non their bicycles, while walking\ndown the street or in the base-\nments of homes. A woman in\nBucha, where many of the dead\nwere found, discovered three bod-\nies in her garden.\n\nMany of the victims had been\nshot in the head. A coroner in\nBucha said his team had collected\ndozens. The Russians fired at any-\none as their tanks rolled through\nthe town in the war’s early days,\nsome residents said.\n\nRussian officials denied respon-\nsibility, dismissing the photo-\ngraphs of bodies as fabricated, but\nsatellite images taken during the\nRussian occupation of Bucha and\nother towns belied their claims.\n\nAn analysis of the satellite im-\nages by The New York Times\n\nContinued on Page Al2\n\nResidents Stagger Outside After Month of Agony\n\nBy CARLOTTA GALL\n\nNOVA BASAN, Ukraine —\nBadly frightened and hungry, resi-\ndents of Nova Basan, a town east\nof Kyiv, emerged from their cot-\ntages and farmhouses on Monday,\nand described living through the\nterrifying ordeal of the Russian\noccupation — detentions, threats\nand a strict curfew that confined\nthem to their homes with no out-\nside communication for more than\na month.\n\nNova Basan, about 60 miles\neast of the Ukrainian capital, is\none of a stretch of towns and vil-\nlages retaken from Russian con-\n\nViolent Interrogations,\nWith Gunshots Fired\nNear Their Heads\n\ntrol after battles through the last\nweek of March, and just now com-\ning back to life.\n\n“It was terrible,” said Mykola\nDyachenko, the official responsi-\nble for the administration of the\ntown and surrounding villages.\n“People were not expecting such\nthings.” He said he was among\nsome 20 men who were held pris-\noner by Russian troops for 25 days\n\nduring the occupation.\n\nHe looked exhausted, his face\nwaxy and pale.

His eyes\nwere bound with sticky tape, but\nhe heard and felt the gunshot\nabove his head. “It was psycholog-\nical pressure,” he said. “They\nwere trying to kick out of me infor-\nmation that I was not sharing.”\n\nTwo other men also described\n\nContinued on Page A9\n\nat\nTYLER HICKS/THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nThe aftermath of a Russian strike on a cultural center serving as a barracks in Kharkiv, Ukraine.\n\nBy ANTON TROIANOVSKI and MATINA STEVIS-GRIDNEFF\n\nThe images of dead Ukrainians,\nsome with their hands tied and\nothers haphazardly buried in pits,\nspurred shocked Western leaders\non Monday to promise even\ntougher sanctions against Russia,\nincluding possibly on energy, as\nthe Kremlin dug in and showed\nsigns of preparing a new assault.\n\nThe growing evidence that Rus-\nsian soldiers killed scores of civil-\nians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha,\nleaving their bodies behind as\nthey withdrew, prompted Presi-\ndent Biden to call for President\nVladimir V. Putin to face a “war\ncrime trial.” Germany and France\nexpelled a total of 75 Russian dip-\nlomats, and President Emmanuel\nMacron of France said the Euro-\npean Union should consider sanc-\ntions against Russian coal and oil.\n\n“This guy is brutal,” Mr. Biden\nsaid of Mr. Putin. “And what’s hap-\npening in Bucha is outrageous,\nand everyone’s seen it.”\n\nIn Moscow on Monday, Mr.\nPutin said nothing about his war\nin Ukraine, but his spokesman,\nDmitri S. Peskov, said the Kremlin\n“categorically” denied “any alle-\ngations” of Russian involvement\nin the atrocities. Instead, Russia’s\nstate media aired relentless con-\nspiracy theories about what it said\nwas a Ukrainian fabrication, while\nthe authorities threatened to pros-\n\necute anyone who __ publicly\nblamed Russians for the Bucha\nkillings.\n\nRussia said the bodies had been\nplaced only recently on the streets\nafter “all Russian units withdrew\ncompletely from Bucha” around\nMarch 30. But a review of videos\nand satellite imagery by The New\nYork Times shows that many of\nthe civilians were killed more than\nthree weeks ago, when Russia’s\nmilitary was in control of the town.\n\nThe war in Ukraine may now be\nheaded for an even more danger-\nous phase, despite Russia’s with-\ndrawal last week from areas near\nKyiv.\n\nUkrainian and Western officials\nsaid that Russia appeared to be\npositioning troops for an intensi-\nfied assault in the eastern Donbas\narea, where the port city of Mariu-\npol remains under a brutal siege.\nAnd in Kharkiv, roughly 30 miles\nfrom the Russian border, unrelent-\ning bombardment has left parts of\nthe city of 1.4 million unrecogniz-\nable.\n\nThe systematic destruction\nproduces little military gain, but is\npart of a broader strategy to seize\nthe country’s east, analysts and\nU.S. military officials say.\n\nWith the Russian economy\nshowing some signs of resilience\nafter the initial shock of the wide-\n\nIVOR PRICKETT FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nDelivering aid to civilians in\nNova Basan, Ukraine.\n\nranging Western sanctions put in\nplace after Mr. Putin’s invasion in\nFebruary, the Kremlin appeared\nto be girding for a continuation of\nthe war, despite talk in European\ncapitals of now possibly banning\nRussian coal, oil or, less likely, gas.\n\n“They are not going to stop,”\nOleksiy Danilov, the secretary of\nthe National Security and Defense\nCouncil of Ukraine, said in a state-\nment on Monday. “Putin’s order\ngiven to his soldiers to destroy our\nstate has not disappeared.”\n\nIn a visit to Bucha on Monday,\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky of\n\nContinued on Page A9\n\nBeijing Campaign Casts Russia\n\nAs the West's Longtime Victim\n\nBy CHRIS BUCKLEY\n\nWhile Russian troops have bat-\ntered Ukraine, officials in China\nhave been meeting behind closed\ndoors to study a Communist\nParty-produced documentary\nthat extols President Vladimir V.\nPutin of Russia as a hero.\n\nThe humiliating collapse of the\nSoviet Union, the video says, was\nthe result of efforts by the United\nStates to destroy its legitimacy.\nWith swelling music and sunny\nscenes of present-day Moscow,\nthe documentary praises Mr.\nPutin for restoring Stalin’s stand-\ning as a great wartime leader and\nfor renewing patriotic pride in\nRussia’s past.\n\nTo the world, China casts itself\nas a principled onlooker of the war\nin Ukraine, not picking sides, sim-\nply seeking peace.

The area is heavily damaged, with debris and a large crater visible in front of the building. Two individuals can be seen walking through the debris. The building itself shows signs of significant destruction, with broken windows and structural damage.\nSome of the bodies found this past weekend outside Kyiv were face down, and some curled up. Ci- vilians appear to have been killed on their bicycles, while walking down the street or in the base- ments of homes. A woman in Bucha, where many of the dead were found, discovered three bod- ies in her garden. \nMany of the victims had been shot in the head. A coroner in Bucha said his team had collected dozens. The Russians fired at any- one as their tanks rolled through the town in the war’s early days, some residents said. \nRussian officials denied respon- sibility, dismissing the photo- graphs of bodies as fabricated, but satellite images taken during the Russian occupation of Bucha and other towns belied their claims.

The growing evidence that Rus- sian soldiers killed scores of civil- ians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, leaving their bodies behind as they withdrew, prompted Presi- dent Biden to call for President Vladimir V . Putin to face a “war crime trial.” Germany and France expelled a total of 75 Russian dip- lomats, and President Emmanuel Macron of France said the Euro- pean Union should consider sanc- tions against Russian coal and oil. “This guy is brutal,” Mr. Biden said of Mr. Putin. “And what’s hap- pening in Bucha is outrageous, and everyone’s seen it.” In Moscow on Monday, Mr. Putin said nothing about his war in Ukraine, but his spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said the Kremlin “categorically” denied “any alle- gations” of Russian involvement in the atrocities. Instead, Russia’s state media aired relentless con- spiracy theories about what it said was a Ukrainian fabrication, while the authorities threatened to pros- ecute  anyone  who  publicly blamed Russians for the Bucha \nUkrainian and Western officials said that Russia appeared to be positioning troops for an intensi- fied assault in the eastern Donbas area, where the port city of Mariu- pol remains under a brutal siege. And in Kharkiv, roughly 30 miles from the Russian border, unrelent- ing bombardment has left parts of the city of 1.4 million unrecogniz- able. \nThe  systematic  destruction produces little military gain, but is part of a broader strategy to seize the country’s east, analysts and U.S. military officials say.

But a review of videos and satellite imagery by The New York Times shows that many of the civilians were killed more than three weeks ago, when Russia’s military was in control of the town. The war in Ukraine may now be headed for an even more danger- ous phase, despite Russia’s with- drawal last week from areas near Kyiv. \nBeijing Campaign Casts Russia As the West’s Longtime Victim \nBy CHRIS BUCKLEY \nWhile Russian troops have bat- tered Ukraine, officials in China have been meeting behind closed doors to study a Communist Party-produced  documentary that extols President Vladimir V . Putin of Russia as a hero. The humiliating collapse of the Soviet Union, the video says, was the result of efforts by the United States to destroy its legitimacy. With swelling music and sunny scenes of present-day Moscow, the documentary praises Mr. Putin for restoring Stalin’s stand- ing as a great wartime leader and for renewing patriotic pride in Russia’s past. To the world, China casts itself as a principled onlooker of the war in Ukraine, not picking sides, sim- ply seeking peace. At home, though, the Chinese Communist Party is pushing a campaign that \nand defends China’s strong ties with Moscow as vital.
