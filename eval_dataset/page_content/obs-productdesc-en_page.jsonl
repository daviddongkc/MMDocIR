So select an\n\nappropriate region when purchasing a resource package.\n\ne OBS provides resource packages only for some billing\nitems. For other billing items, the pay-per-use billing\nmode applies. For details, see Resource Package\nOverview.\n\ne Any resource usage beyond your package quotas in the\ncurrent month is billed in the pay-per-use mode. A newly\npurchased resource package cannot cover the already\ngenerated resource usage.\n\ne A resource package must match your bucket's data\nredundancy policy (single-AZ storage or multi-AZ\nstorage) and storage class (Standard, Infrequent Access,\nArchive, or Deep Archive), or the pay-per-use billing\napplies.\n\ne Your Standard storage, Archive storage, and Internet\noutbound traffic packages can cover the fees incurred by\nboth your parallel file systems and buckets. The pull\ntraffic and cross-region replication traffic packages are\ncurrently not available for parallel file systems.\n\nAccess rules In consideration of the DNS resolution performance and\nreliability, OBS requires that the bucket name must precede\nthe domain when a request carrying a bucket name is\nconstructed to form a three-level domain name, also\nmentioned as virtual-hosted-style access domain name.\n\nFor example, you have a bucket named test-bucket in the\nap-southeast-1 region, and you want to access the ACL of\nan object named test-object in the bucket.
