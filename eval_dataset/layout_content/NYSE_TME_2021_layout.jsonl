It does not engage in operations itself but rather conducts its operations through its PRC subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities, or the VIEs. However, we and our direct and indirect subsidiaries do not, and it is virtually impossible for them to, have any equity interests in the VIEs in practice as current PRC laws and regulations restrict foreign investment in companies that engage in value-added telecommunication services and online cultural services. As a result, we depend on certain contractual arrangements with the VIEs to operate a significant portion of our business. This structure allows us to exercise effective control over the VIEs, and is designed to replicate substantially the same economic benefits as would be provided by direct ownership. The VIEs are owned by certain nominee shareholders, not us. Investors of our ADSs are purchasing equity securities of a Cayman Islands holding company rather than equity securities issued by our subsidiaries and the VIEs. Investors who are non-PRC residents may never directly hold equity interests in the VIEs under current PRC laws and regulations.

{"layout": 259, "type": "text", "text": "On March 15, 2019, the National People’s Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2020 and replaced three existing laws regulating foreign investment in China, namely, the Wholly Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law of the PRC, the Sino- Foreign Cooperative Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC and the Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law of the PRC, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law of the PRC embodies an expected PRC regulatory trend to rationalize its foreign investment regulatory regime in line with prevailing international practice and the legislative efforts to unify the corporate legal requirements for both foreign and domestic investments. However, since it is relatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. For example, the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC adds a catch-all clause to the definition of “foreign investment” so that foreign investment, by its definition, includes “investments made by foreign investors in China through other means defined by other laws or administrative regulations or provisions promulgated by the State Council” without further elaboration on the meaning of “other means.” The Implementing Regulation of the Foreign Investment Law Regulations, or the FIL Interpretations, adopted by the State Council on December 12, 2019 also did not provide further clarification for such “other means.” In accordance with the FIL Interpretations, where a party concerned claims an investment agreement to be invalid on the basis that it is for investment in prohibited industries under the negative list or it is for investment in restricted industries under the negative list and violates the restrictions set out therein, the courts should support such claim. It leaves leeway for future legislations to be promulgated by competent PRC legislative institutions to provide for contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment. The most recently updated negative list, issued on December 27, 2021 and became effective on January 1, 2022, stipulates that any PRC domestic enterprise engaging in prohibited industries under the negative list shall obtain the consent of the relevant competent PRC authorities for overseas listing, and the foreign investors shall not participate in the operation and management of such enterprise, and the shareholding percentage of the foreign investors in such enterprise shall be subject to the relevant administrative provisions of the PRC domestic securities investment by foreign investors. Such negative list does not further elaborate whether existing overseas listed enterprise will be subject to such requirements. The staff of the National Development and Reform Commission, or the NDRC, addressed in an interview on December 27, 2021 that certain existing overseas listed enterprises whose foreign investors’ shareholding percentage exceed the aforementioned threshold are not required to make adjustment or deduction. It is unclear, however, whether the aforesaid provisions in the most recently updated negative list will apply to the companies that conduct their business operations in the PRC through contractual arrangements.

In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.

Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China.

In February 2021, the SAMR promulgated the Guidelines to Anti-Monopoly in the Field of Internet Platforms, or the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms, aiming to improve anti-monopoly administration on online platforms. The Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms will operate as a compliance guidance under the existing PRC anti-monopoly laws and regulations for platform economy operators. However, considering the substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and implementation of the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms, we may face challenges in addressing its requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices, and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with the Anti-Monopoly Guidelines for Internet Platforms and other anti-monopoly laws and regulations may result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation or claims against us and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. On December 18, 2021, the National Anti-monopoly Bureau was officially established to formulate anti-monopoly institutional measures and guidelines, implement anti-monopoly law enforcement, undertake the guidance for enterprises’ anti-monopoly action responding abroad and so on.

If we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. taxpayer holds ADSs or Class A ordinary shares, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could apply to such U.S. taxpayer.

In September 2019 and October 2019, respectively, the Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers were named as defendants in two putative securities class actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York (the “Federal Court Action”) and the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the “State Court Action”). Amended complaints in both actions were filed in February 2020, at which time Tencent, based on its status as our controlling shareholder, was named as a defendant in the Federal Court Action, and the Company’s underwriters in its initial public offering were added as defendants in both actions. Both actions, purportedly brought on behalf of a class of persons who allegedly suffered damages as a result of their trading in the ADSs, allege that our Registration Statement dated December 12, 2018 and our annual report dated April 19, 2019 on Form 20-F contained material misstatements and omissions in violation of the U.S. federal securities laws. On April 14, 2020, the Company served a motion to dismiss the Federal Court Action, which was fully briefed and submitted to the court on May 15, 2020. On May 8, 2020, the Company filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, stay, the State Court Action. By order dated August 21, 2020, the State Court Action was stayed in all respects, pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the Federal Court Action. On March 31, 2021, the Company’s motion to dismiss the Federal Court Action was granted by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On April 29, 2021, the plaintiffs in the Federal Court Action filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, which was granted on December 27, 2021. A second amended complaint was filed in the Federal Court Action on January 10, 2022. On February 18, 2022, the Company served a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint filed in the Federal Court Action, which was fully brief and submitted to the court on March 11, 2022.

Our company is incorporated outside the PRC. As a holding company, its key assets are its ownership interests in its subsidiaries, and its key assets are located, and its records (including the resolutions of its board of directors and the resolutions of its shareholders) are maintained, outside the PRC. As such, we do not believe that our company meets all of the conditions above or is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC tax purposes. For the same reasons, we believe that our other entities outside of China are not PRC resident enterprises either. However, the tax resident status of an enterprise is subject to determination by the PRC tax authorities and uncertainties remain with respect to the interpretation of the term “de facto management body.” There can be no assurance that the PRC government will ultimately take a view that is consistent with us. If the PRC tax authorities determine that our Cayman Islands holding company is a PRC resident enterprise for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, a number of unfavorable PRC tax consequences could follow. For example, a   $10\\%$   withholding tax would be imposed on dividends we pay to our non-PRC enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders). In addition, nonresident enterprise shareholders (including the ADS holders) may be subject to PRC tax on gains realized on the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Class A ordinary shares, if such income is treated as sourced from within the PRC. Furthermore, if we are deemed a PRC resident enterprise, dividends paid to our non-PRC individual shareholders (including the ADS holders) and any gain realized on the transfer of ADSs or Class A ordinary shares by such shareholders may be subject to PRC tax at a rate of  $20\\%$  (which, in the case of dividends, may be withheld at source by us). These rates may be reduced by an applicable tax treaty, but it is unclear whether non-PRC shareholders of our company would be able to claim the benefits of any tax treaties between their country of tax residence and the PRC in the event that we are treated as a PRC resident enterprise.

Specifically, the Draft FIE Law introduces the concept of “actual control” for determining whether an entity is considered to be an FIE. In addition to control through direct or indirect ownership or equity, the Draft FIE Law includes control through contractual arrangements within the definition of “actual control”. The Draft FIE Law includes provisions that would exempt from the definition of foreign invested enterprises entities where the ultimate controlling shareholders are either entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. The Draft FIE Law is silent as to what type of enforcement action might be taken against existing entities that operate in restricted or prohibited industries and are not controlled by entities organized under PRC law or individuals who are PRC citizens. If the restrictions and prohibitions on foreign invested enterprises included in the Draft FIE Law are enacted and enforced in their current form, the Company’s ability to use the Contractual Arrangements and the Company’s ability to conduct business through them could be severely limited.
