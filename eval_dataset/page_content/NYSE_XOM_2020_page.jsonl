RISK FACTORS\n\nExxonMobil’s financial and operating results are subject to a variety of risks inherent in the global oil, gas, and petrochemical\nbusinesses. Many of these risk factors are not within the Company’s control and could adversely affect our business, our financial and\noperating results, or our financial condition. These risk factors include:\n\nSupply and Demand\n\nThe oil, gas, and petrochemical businesses are fundamentally commodity businesses. This means ExxonMobil’s operations and\nearnings may be significantly affected by changes in oil, gas, and petrochemical prices and by changes in margins on refined products.\nOil, gas, petrochemical, and product prices and margins in turn depend on local, regional, and global events or conditions that affect\nsupply and demand for the relevant commodity. Any material decline in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect\non certain of the Company’s operations, especially in the Upstream segment, financial condition, and proved reserves. On the other\nhand, a material increase in oil or natural gas prices could have a material adverse effect on certain of the Company’s operations,\nespecially in the Downstream and Chemical segments.\n\nEconomic conditions. The demand for energy and petrochemicals is generally linked closely with broad-based economic activities\nand levels of prosperity. The occurrence of recessions or other periods of low or negative economic growth will typically have a direct\nadverse impact on our results. Other factors that affect general economic conditions in the world or in a major region, such as changes\nin population growth rates, periods of civil unrest, government austerity programs, trade tariffs, security or public health issues and\nresponses, or currency exchange rate fluctuations, can also impact the demand for energy and petrochemicals. Sovereign debt\ndowngrades, defaults, inability to access debt markets due to credit or legal constraints, liquidity crises, the breakup or restructuring of\nfiscal, monetary, or political systems such as the European Union, and other events or conditions that impair the functioning of\nfinancial markets and institutions also pose risks to ExxonMobil, including risks to the safety of our financial assets and to the ability\nof our partners and customers to fulfill their commitments to ExxonMobil. Demand reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic as wel\nas accompanying conditions of oversupply have led to a significant decrease in commodity prices and margins. Future business\nresults, including cash flows and financing needs, will be affected by the extent and duration of these conditions and the effectiveness\nof responsive actions that the Corporation and others take, including actions to reduce capital and operating expenses, and actions\ntaken by governments and others to address the COVID-19 pandemic including the ongoing development and distribution of\nCOVID-19 vaccines, and the impact of the pandemic on national and global economies and markets.\n\nOther demand-related factors. Other factors that may affect the demand for oil, gas, and petrochemicals, and therefore impact our\nresults, include technological improvements in energy efficiency; seasonal weather patterns; increased competitiveness of, or\ngovernment policy support for, alternative energy sources; changes in technology that alter fuel choices, such as technological!\nadvances in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation; changes in consumer preferences for our\nproducts, including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternatives to plastic products; and broad-\nbased changes in personal income levels.\n\nOther supply-related factors. Commodity prices and margins also vary depending on a number of factors affecting supply. For\nexample, increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply sources and technologies to enhance recovery from\nexisting sources tend to reduce commodity prices to the extent such supply increases are not offset by commensurate growth in\ndemand. Similarly, increases in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margins\non the affected products. World oil, gas, and petrochemical supply levels can also be affected by factors that reduce available supplies,\nsuch as adherence by countries to OPEC production quotas and other agreements among sovereigns, government policies that restrict\noil and gas production or increase associated costs, and the occurrence of wars, hostile actions, natural disasters, disruptions in\ncompetitors’ operations, logistics constraints or unexpected unavailability of distribution channels that may disrupt supplies.\nTechnological change can also alter the relative costs for competitors to find, produce, and refine oil and gas and to manufacture\npetrochemicals.\n\nOther market factors. ExxonMobil’s business results are also exposed to potential negative impacts due to changes in interest rates,\ninflation, currency exchange rates, and other local or regional market conditions.\n", "vlm_text": "Information concerning the source and availability of raw materials used in the Corporation’s business, the extent of seasonality in the  business, the possibility of renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of governments and risks attendant to  foreign operations may be found in “Item 1A.

Many governments are providing tax advantages and other subsidies to support transitioning to alternative energy  sources or are mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. Governments and others are also promoting research into new  technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. We are conducting our own research both in- house and by working with more than 80 leading universities around the world, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,  Princeton University, The University of Texas, and Stanford University in the U.S., and in Singapore with Nanyang Technological  Institute and the National University. Our research projects focus on developing advanced biofuels and hydrogen, carbon capture and  storage, breakthrough energy efficiency processes, advanced energy-saving materials, and other technologies in collaboration with our  partners including Synthetic Genomics, FuelCell Energy and Global Thermostat. Our future results may depend in part on the success  of our research efforts and on our ability to adapt and apply the strengths of our current business model to providing the energy  products of the future in a cost-competitive manner. See “Operational and Other Factors” below. \nOperational and Other Factors \nIn addition to external economic and political factors, our future business results also depend on our ability to manage successfully  those factors that are at least in part within our control. The extent to which we manage these factors will impact our performance  relative to competition. For projects in which we are not the operator, we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co- venturers whom we do not control. \nExploration and development program.  Our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our  exploration and development efforts. Among other factors, we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising  resource prospects and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resources on line as scheduled and within budget. \nProject and portfolio management.  The long-term success of ExxonMobil’s Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses  depends on complex, long-term, capital intensive projects. These projects in turn require a high degree of project management  expertise to maximize efficiency. Specific factors that can affect the performance of major projects include our ability to: negotiate  successfully with joint venturers, partners, governments, suppliers, customers, or others; model and optimize reservoir performance;  develop markets for project outputs, whether through long-term contracts or the development of effective spot markets; manage  changes in operating conditions and costs, including costs of third party equipment or services such as drilling rigs and shipping;  prevent, to the extent possible, and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulties that could delay project startup or cause  unscheduled project downtime; and influence the performance of project operators where ExxonMobil does not perform that role. In  addition to the effective management of individual projects, ExxonMobil’s success, including our ability to mitigate risk and provide  attractive returns to shareholders, depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio, including diversification among  types and locations of our projects and strategies to divest assets. We may not be able to divest assets at a price or on the timeline we  contemplate in our strategies.

Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating\norganization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities\nand Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of\nExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves\nof crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved\nin the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the Global Reserves and\nResources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering\nand currently serves on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed with\nindividuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the\nclassification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either\nEngineering or Geology.\n\nThe Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates.\nAppropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this\ncentral database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation\nprocess include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing\napproval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial\nreserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized\ngeoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed\ncertain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization\nbefore the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved\nreserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior\nmanagement for final endorsement.\n\n2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves\n\nAt year-end 2020, approximately 5.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as\nproved undeveloped. This represents 33 percent of the 15.2 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 7.7 GOEB of\nproved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2019. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that resulted\nin the transfer of approximately 0.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The largest transfers\nwere related to development activities in the United States, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Guyana. During 2020, extensions,\nprimarily in the United States and Canada, resulted in an addition of approximately 0.5 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also,\nas a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, the Corporation reclassified\napproximately 2.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the\nUnited States and Canada.\n\nOverall, investments of $10.7 billion were made by the Corporation during 2020 to progress the development of reported proved\nundeveloped reserves, including $10.4 billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil\nand gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments\nrepresented 74 percent of the $14.4 billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures.\n\nOne of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments\ntoward the development of the reserves. ExxonMobil has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require long lead-\ntime in order to be developed. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped\nreserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. Proved undeveloped reserves in Australia,\nKazakhstan, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates have remained undeveloped for five years or more primarily due to\nconstraints on the capacity of infrastructure, as well as the time required to complete development for very large projects. The\nCorporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however, the timing and amount recovered can be\naffected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals,\ngovernment policies, consumer preferences, the pace of co-venturer/government funding, changes in the amount and timing of capital\ninvestments, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. Of the proved undeveloped reserves that have been\nreported for five or more years, over 80 percent are contained in the aforementioned countries. In Australia, proved undeveloped\nreserves are associated with future compression for the Gorgon Jansz LNG project. In Kazakhstan, the proved undeveloped reserves\nare related to the remainder of the Tengizchevroil joint venture development that includes a production license in the Tengiz - Korolev\nfield complex. The Tengizchevroil joint venture is producing, and proved undeveloped reserves will continue to move to proved\ndeveloped as approved development phases progress. In the United Arab Emirates, proved undeveloped reserves are associated with\nan approved development plan and continued drilling investment for the producing Upper Zakum field.\n", "vlm_text": "C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves \nExxonMobil has a dedicated Global Reserves and Resources group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating  organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with Securities  and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of  ExxonMobil’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil’s proved reserves  of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved  in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The Manager of the Global Reserves and  Resources group has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering  and currently serves on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). The group is staffed with  individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the  classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either  Engineering or Geology. \nThe Global Reserves and Resources group maintains a central database containing the official company reserves estimates.  Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this  central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation  process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing  approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial  reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized  geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed  certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization  before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved  reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior  management for final endorsement. \n2. Proved Undeveloped Reserves \nAt year-end 2020, approximately 5.0 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) of ExxonMobil’s proved reserves were classified as  proved undeveloped. This represents 33 percent of the 15.2 GOEB reported in proved reserves. This compares to the 7.7 GOEB of  proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2019. During the year, ExxonMobil conducted development activities that resulted  in the transfer of approximately 0.9 GOEB from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves by year end. The largest transfers  were related to development activities in the United States, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Guyana. During 2020, extensions,  primarily in the United States and Canada, resulted in an addition of approximately 0.5 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves. Also,  as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, the Corporation reclassified  approximately 2.3 GOEB of proved undeveloped reserves which no longer met the SEC definition of proved reserves, primarily in the  United States and Canada. \nOverall, investments of   $\\S10.7$   billion were made by the Corporation during 2020 to progress the development of reported proved  undeveloped reserves, including  $\\S10.4$   billion for oil and gas producing activities, along with additional investments for other non-oil  and gas producing activities such as the construction of support infrastructure and other related facilities. These investments  represented 74 percent of the  $\\S14.4$   billion in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. \nOne of ExxonMobil’s requirements for reporting proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments  toward the development of the reserves.

The numbers and lines in the image represent the successive subtraction of multiples of the divisor from segments of the dividend."}

By presidential decree, SEKMIGAS became the interim successor to BPMIGAS. The current PSCs have an\nexploration period of six years, which can be extended up to 10 years, and an exploitation period of 20 years. PSCs generally require\nthe contractor to relinquish 10 to 20 percent of the contract area after three years and generally allow the contractor to retain no more\nthan 50 to 80 percent of the original contract area after six years, depending on the acreage and terms.\n\nIraq\n\nDevelopment and production activities in the state-owned oil and gas fields are governed by contracts with regional oil companies of\nthe Iraqi Ministry of Oil.

The contract provides for cost recovery plus per-barrel fees\nfor incremental production above specified levels.\n\nExploration and production activities in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq are governed by production sharing contracts (PSCs) negotiated\nwith the regional government of Kurdistan in 2011. The exploration term is for five years, with extensions available as provided by the\nPSCs and at the discretion of the regional government of Kurdistan. Current PSCs remain in effect by agreement of the regional\ngovernment to allow additional time for exploration or evaluation of commerciality. The production period is 20 years with the right to\nextend for five years.\n\nKazakhstan\n\nOnshore exploration and production activities are governed by the production license, exploration license, and joint venture\nagreements negotiated with the Republic of Kazakhstan. Existing production operations have a 40-year production period that\ncommenced in 1993.\n\nOffshore exploration and production activities are governed by a production sharing agreement negotiated with the Republic of\nKazakhstan.

The company’s integrated business model, with significant\ninvestments in Upstream, Downstream and Chemical segments, generally reduces the Corporation’s risk from changes in commodity\nprices.

Volume projections are based on individual\nfield production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Price ranges for crude oil, natural gas, refined products, and\nchemical products are based on corporate plan assumptions developed annually by major region and are utilized for investment\nevaluation purposes. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. Once major\ninvestments are made, a reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lessons are learned and improvements are incorporated\ninto future projects.\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nLong-Term Business Outlook\n\nGiven the uncertainty around the near-term impacts of COVID-19 on economic growth, energy demand and energy supply, and lack\nof precedent, the Company is considering a range of recovery pathways to guide near-term plans. These pathways expect that energy\ndemand will grow beyond 2019 levels as early as 2022 reflecting the phase out of COVID-19 impacts and re-establishment of long-\nterm supply/demand fundamentals. The Corporation’s Outlook for Energy combined with the near-term pathways are used to help\ninform our long-term business strategies and investment plans.\n\nBy 2040, the world’s population is projected at around 9.1 billion people, or about 1.6 billion more than in 2018. Coincident with this\npopulation increase, the Corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to 2.5 percent per year, with economic\noutput growing by around 75 percent by 2040. As economies and populations grow, and as living standards improve for billions of\npeople, the need for energy is expected to continue to rise. Even with significant efficiency gains, global energy demand is projected to\nrise by more than 10 percent from 2018 to 2040. This increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing countries (i.e.,\nthose that are not member nations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)).\n\nAs expanding prosperity helps drive global energy demand higher, increasing use of energy efficient technologies and practices as\nwell as lower-emission products will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions per unit of economic\noutput over time. Substantial efficiency gains are likely in all key aspects of the world’s economy through 2040, affecting energy\nrequirements for power generation, transportation, industrial applications, and residential and commercial needs.\n\nGlobal electricity demand is expected to increase approximately 50 percent from 2018 to 2040, with developing countries likely to\naccount for about 85 percent of the increase. Consistent with this projection, power generation is expected to remain the largest and\nfastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand, supported by a wide variety of energy sources. The share of coal\nfired generation is likely to decline substantially and approach 20 percent of the world’s electricity in 2040, versus nearly 40 percent in\n2018, in part as a result of policies to improve air quality as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions to address the risks related to\nclimate change. From 2018 to 2040, the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas, nuclear power, and renewables is likely to\nnearly double, accounting for the entire growth in electricity supplies and offsetting the reduction of coal. Electricity from wind and\nsolar is likely to increase about 400 percent, helping total renewables (including other sources, e.g. hydropower) to account for about\n80 percent of the increase in electricity supplies worldwide through 2040. Total renewables will likely reach about 50 percent of\nglobal electricity supplies by 2040. Natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase shares over the period to 2040, reaching more\nthan 25 percent and about 10 percent of global electricity supplies respectively by 2040. Supplies of electricity by energy type will\nreflect significant differences across regions reflecting a wide range of factors including the cost and availability of various energy\nsupplies and policy developments.\n\nEnergy for transportation — including cars, trucks, ships, trains and airplanes — is expected to increase by about 20 percent from 2018\nto 2040. Transportation energy demand is likely to account for over 60 percent of the growth in liquid fuels demand worldwide over\nthis period. Light-duty vehicle demand for liquid fuels is projected to peak prior to 2025 and then decline to levels seen in the\nearly-2010s by 2040 as the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric cars, led by China, Europe, and the United\nStates, work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about 60 percent. By 2040, light-duty vehicles are expected to account for\nabout 20 percent of global liquid fuels demand. During the same time period, nearly all the world’s commercial transportation fleets\nare likely to continue to run on liquid fuels, which are widely available and offer practical advantages in providing a large quantity of\nenergy in small volumes.\n\nLiquid fuels provide the largest share of global energy supplies today reflecting broad-based availability, affordability, ease of\ntransportation, and fitness as a practical solution to meet a wide variety of needs. By 2040, global demand for liquid fuels is projected\nto grow to approximately 110 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of about 9 percent from 2018. The non-OECD\nshare of global liquid fuels demand is expected to increase to about 65 percent by 2040, as liquid fuels demand in the OECD is likely\nto decline by close to 15 percent. Much of the global liquid fuels demand today is met by crude production from traditional\nconventional sources; these supplies will remain important, and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the\nnatural declines from these fields. At the same time, a variety of emerging supply sources — including tight oil, deepwater, oil sands,\nnatural gas liquids and biofuels — are expected to grow to help meet rising demand. The world’s resource base is sufficient to meet\nprojected demand through 2040 as technology advances continue to expand the availability of economic and lower carbon supply\noptions. However, timely investments will remain critical to meeting global needs with reliable and affordable supplies.\n\n40\n", "vlm_text": "The corporate plan is a fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting operating and capital objectives in  addition to providing the economic assumptions used for investment evaluation purposes.

Global natural gas demand is\nexpected to rise about 25 percent from 2018 to 2040, with about half of that increase coming from the Asia Pacific region. Significant\ngrowth in supplies of unconventional gas — the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formations — will help meet these needs.\nIn total, about 55 percent of the growth in natural gas supplies is expected to be from unconventional sources. At the same time,\nconventionally-produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply, meeting more than two thirds of worldwide\ndemand in 2040. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade will expand significantly, meeting about 40 percent of the increase in global\ndemand growth, with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in Asia Pacific.\n\nThe world’s energy mix is highly diverse and will remain so through 2040. Oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with\nits share remaining close to 30 percent in 2040. Coal is currently the second largest source of energy, but it is likely to lose that\nposition to natural gas in the next few years. The share of natural gas is expected to reach more than 25 percent by 2040, while the\nshare of coal falls to about two thirds of the natural gas share. Nuclear power is projected to grow significantly, as many nations are\nlikely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity needs as well as energy security and environmental issues. Total\nrenewable energy is likely to exceed 15 percent of global energy by 2040, with biomass, hydro and geothermal contributing a\ncombined share of more than 10 percent. Total energy supplied from wind, solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly, growing\nover 350 percent from 2018 to 2040, when they will likely be just over 6 percent of the world energy mix.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates that the world’s available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discoveries, but also\nfrom increases in previously discovered fields. Technology will underpin these increases. The investments to develop and supply\nresources to meet global demand through 2040 will be significant — even if demand remains flat. This reflects a fundamental aspect of\nthe oil and natural gas business as the International Energy Agency (IEA) describes in its World Energy Outlook 2020. According to\nthe IEA’s Stated Energy Policies Scenario, the investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirements worldwide over\nthe period 2019-2040 will be about $17 trillion (measured in 2019 dollars). In the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario, which is\nin line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the investment need would still accumulate to $12 trillion.\n\nInternational accords and underlying regional and national regulations covering greenhouse gas emissions continue to evolve with\nuncertain timing and outcome, making it difficult to predict their business impact. For many years, the Corporation has taken into\naccount policies established to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in its long-term Outlook for Energy. The climate\naccord reached at the Conference of the Parties (COP 21) in Paris set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging.\nOur Outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policies and is consistent with the aggregation of Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (NDCs), which were submitted by signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate\nChange (UNFCCC) 2015 Paris Agreement. Our Outlook seeks to identify potential impacts of climate related policies, which often\ntarget specific sectors. It estimates potential impacts of these policies on consumer energy demand by using various assumptions and\ntools — including, depending on the sector, application of a proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policies (e.g. automotive\nfuel economy standards). For purposes of the Outlook, a proxy cost on energy-related CO, emissions is assumed to reach about $80\nper tonne in 2040 in OECD nations. China and other leading non-OECD nations are expected to trail OECD policy initiatives.\nNevertheless, as people and nations look for ways to reduce risks of global climate change, they will continue to need practical\nsolutions that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need. The Corporation continues to monitor the\nupdates to the NDCs that nations are expected to provide in preparation for COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021 as well as other\npolicy developments in light of net zero ambitions recently formulated by some nations.\n\nThe information provided in the Long-Term Business Outlook includes ExxonMobil’s internal estimates and projections based upon\ninternal data and analyses as well as publicly available information from external sources including the International Energy Agency.\n\nPositioning for a Lower-Carbon Energy Future\n\nPractical solutions to the world’s energy and climate challenges will benefit from market competition in addition to well-informed,\nwell-designed, and transparent policy approaches that carefully weigh costs and benefits. Such policies are likely to help manage the\nrisks of climate change while also enabling societies to pursue other high priority goals around the world — including clean air and\nwater, access to reliable and affordable energy, and economic progress for all people. ExxonMobil encourages sound policy solutions\nthat reduce climate-related risks across the economy at the lowest societal cost. All practical and economically-viable energy sources\nwill need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand, recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy needs as\nwell as the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standards of living for billions of people.\n\nExxonMobil is committed to advancing sustainable, effective solutions that address both the world’s growing demand for energy and\nthe risks of climate change. The Company’s plans aim for industry-leading greenhouse gas performance across its businesses by 2030.\nThese plans include a reduction of the intensity of operated upstream greenhouse gas emissions by 15 to 20 percent in 2025, compared\nto 2016 levels, which will be supported by a 40 to 50 percent decrease in methane intensity and a 35 to 45 percent decrease in flaring\nintensity across the Corporation’s global operations. The 2025 emission reduction plans are expected to result in a reduction of\nabsolute emissions by approximately 30 percent for the Company’s current Upstream business by 2025 when compared to 2016\nlevels.

During the second quarter downturn, global demand\nfor gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel declined about 23 percent versus 2019. While demand partially recovered in the second half of the\nyear, fourth quarter total products demand remained 10 percent below 2019 levels. This unprecedented demand impact adversely\naffected refining margins resulting in historically low market conditions, with announced refinery closures four times higher than 10-\nyear historical levels. In the near-term, refining margins will continue to be impacted by COVID-19 demand recovery. Finished\nlubricant demand was also impacted by COVID-19, with ExxonMobil’s estimate of industry demand down 5 to 10 percent versus\n2019.\n\nRefining margins are largely driven by differences in commodity prices and are a function of the difference between what a refinery\npays for its raw materials and the market prices for the range of products produced. Crude oil and many products are widely traded\nwith published prices, including those quoted on multiple exchanges around the world (e.g., New York Mercantile Exchange and\nIntercontinental Exchange). Prices for these commodities are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many\nfactors, including global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, industry refinery operations, import/export balances,\ncurrency fluctuations, seasonal demand, weather, and political climate.\n\nExxonMobil’s long-term outlook is that industry refining margins will remain volatile subject to shifting consumer demand as well as\ncapacity changes from refinery additions and closures. ExxonMobil’s significant integration both within the Downstream value chains\nincluding lubricants, logistics, trading, refining, and marketing, as well as with Upstream and Chemical, improves our ability to\ngenerate shareholder value in different market conditions.\n\nAs described in Item 1A. Risk Factors, proposed carbon policy and other climate related regulations in many countries, as well as the\ncontinued growth in biofuels mandates, could have negative impacts on the Downstream business.\n\nExxonMobil continually evaluates the Downstream portfolio during all phases of the business cycle, which has resulted in numerous\nasset divestments over the past decade to strengthen overall profitability and resiliency. When investing in the Downstream,\nExxonMobil remains focused on select and resilient projects across a broad range of market conditions. In 2020, the Strathcona\nCogeneration project started up to improve refinery energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the main\nsegment of the Wink to Webster pipeline system, operated by ExxonMobil Pipeline Company, started transporting Permian crude\nfrom Midland to Houston. Finally, deferral costs associated with pacing previously announced Downstream projects will be offset\nwith efficiencies captured during the market downturn.\n\nExxonMobil continues to grow fuels product sales in new markets near major production assets with continued progress in the Mexico\nand Indonesia market entries. The lubricants business continues to grow, leveraging world class brands and integration with industry\nleading basestock refining capability.

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically\noccur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay-\nout in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination\nor expiry of a concession.

These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to\nanother. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase\nor decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for\nExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for\noil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in\nproduction agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production limits\nimposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a\nfield or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nGrowth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may\naffect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil.

The parentheses likely indicate negative values or deductions.\n(1) Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. \nListed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil’s volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the  terms. \nEntitlements - Net Interest  are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes caused by non-operational changes to volume- determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur when cumulative investment returns or production volumes achieve defined thresholds, changes in equity upon achieving pay- out in partner investment carry situations, equity re determinations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination  or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as  lower crude oil prices. \nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other  are changes to ExxonMobil’s share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to  non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to  another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase  or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for  ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for  oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in  production agreements. \nGovernment Mandates  are changes to ExxonMobil's sustainable production levels due to temporary non-operational production limits  imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production. \nDivestments  are reductions in ExxonMobil’s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a  field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration. \nGrowth and Other  factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may  affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project and  work program activities, acquisitions including additions from asset exchanges, downtime, market demand, natural field decline, and  any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.

The Corporation is prioritizing opportunities to hold 2021 capital spending in a range of\n$16 billion to $19 billion. Actual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.\n\nUpstream spending of $14.4 billion in 2020 was down 39 percent from 2019 in response to market conditions. Investments in 2020\nincluded the U.S. Permian Basin and key development projects in Guyana. Development projects typically take several years from the\ntime of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. The\npercentage of proved developed reserves was 67 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2020, and has been over 60 percent for\nthe last ten years.\n\nCapital investments in the Downstream totaled $4.2 billion in 2020, a decrease of $0.2 billion from 2019, reflecting lower global\nproject spending.

However, the global COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020 has brought unprecedented uncertainties to\nnear-term economic outlooks. The Corporation continues to monitor market trends and works to minimize costs in all commodity\nprice environments through its economies of scale in global procurement and its efficient project management practices.\n\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\n\nDuring 2020, ExxonMobil conducted an extensive global review of staffing levels and subsequently commenced targeted workforce\nreductions within a number of countries to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Probable reserves are reserves that, together with proved reserves, are as likely as not to be recovered. \nRevisions in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields can occur due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1)  already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of  first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and / or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from  significant changes in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity. \nUnit-of-Production Depreciation \nOil and natural gas reserve volumes are used as the basis to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates for most upstream assets.  Depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves or proved developed reserves applied to actual  production. The volumes produced and asset cost are known, while proved reserves are based on estimates that are subject to some  variability. "}

{"page": 79, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_XOM_2020_79.jpg", "ocr_text": "MANAGEMENT?’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nDifferences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year\nthat the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension\nexpense over the expected remaining service life of employees.\n\nLitigation Contingencies\n\nA variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending\nlawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for\naccounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.\n\nThe Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount\ncan be reasonably estimated. These accrued liabilities are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or claims\nagainst third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation\nrevises such accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which\nare significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For\npurposes of our litigation contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management\nbelieves should be disclosed.\n\nManagement judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict.\nHowever, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on\noperations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are\noften reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.\n\nTax Contingencies\n\nThe Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Significant management judgment is required in\nthe accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict.\n\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the\nfinancial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.\nFor a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is\ngreater than 50 percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference between a position taken or expected to be\ntaken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and\na description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nThe method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is\nprescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiaries. The functional\ncurrency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the functional\ncurrency after evaluating this economic environment.\n\nFactors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows\nrelated to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the\ncountry; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies;\nsources of financing; and significance of intercompany transactions.\n\n60\n", "vlm_text": "Differences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year  that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension  expense over the expected remaining service life of employees. \nLitigation Contingencies \nA variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending  lawsuits. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for  accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16. \nThe Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable, and the amount  can be reasonably estimated. These accrued liabilities are not reduced by amounts that may be recovered under insurance or claims  against third parties, but undiscounted receivables from insurers or other third parties may be accrued separately. The Corporation  revises such accruals in light of new information. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which  are significant, the Corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and, where feasible, an estimate of the possible loss. For  purposes of our litigation contingency disclosures, “significant” includes material matters as well as other items which management  believes should be disclosed. \nManagement judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict.  However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on  operations or financial condition. In the Corporation’s experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are  often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement. \nTax Contingencies \nThe Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. Significant management judgment is required in  the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. \nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the  financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities.  For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is  greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. A reserve is established for the difference between a position taken or expected to be  taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statements. The Corporation’s unrecognized tax benefits and  a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19. \nForeign Currency Translation \nThe method of translating the foreign currency financial statements of the Corporation’s international subsidiaries into U.S. dollars is  prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Under these principles, it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiaries. The functional  currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. Management selects the functional  currency after evaluating this economic environment. \nFactors considered by management when determining the functional currency for a subsidiary include the currency used for cash flows  related to individual assets and liabilities; the responsiveness of sales prices to changes in exchange rates; the history of inflation in the  country; whether sales are into local markets or exported; the currency used to acquire raw materials, labor, services and supplies;  sources of financing; and significance of intercompany transactions.

In 2020, the Corporation identified a number of situations where events or changes in circumstances indicated that\nthe carrying value of certain long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Those situations primarily related to the annual review and\napproval of the Corporation's business and strategic plan. As part of the planning process, the Corporation assessed its full portfolio to\nprioritize assets with the highest future value potential within its broad range of available opportunities in order to optimize resources\nwithin current levels of debt and operating cash flow, as well as identify potential asset divestment candidates. This effort included a\nre-assessment of dry gas assets, primarily in North America, which previously had been included in the Corporation’s future\ndevelopment plans. Under the plan as approved, the Corporation no longer plans to develop a significant portion of its dry gas\nportfolio, including a portion of its resources in the Appalachian, Rocky Mountains, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas\nregions of the U.S., as well as resources in Western Canada and Argentina. The decision not to develop these assets resulted in non-\ncash, before-tax charges of $24.4 billion in Upstream to reduce the carrying value of those assets to fair value. Other before-tax\nimpairment charges in 2020 included $0.9 billion in Upstream, $0.5 billion in Downstream, and $0.1 billion in Chemical. Impairment\ncharges are primarily recognized in the lines “Depreciation and depletion” and “Exploration expenses, including dry holes” on the\nConsolidated Statement of Income.\n\nThe assessment of fair value requires the use of Level 3 inputs and assumptions that are based upon the views of a likely market\nparticipant. The principal parameters used to establish fair value include estimates of acreage values and flowing production metrics\nfrom comparable market transactions, market-based estimates of historical cash flow multiples, and discounted cash flows. Inputs and\nassumptions used in discounted cash flow models include estimates of future production volumes, commodity prices which were\nconsistent with the average of third-party industry experts and government agencies, drilling and development costs, and discount\nrates ranging from 6 percent to 8 percent which are reflective of the characteristics of the asset group.\n\nFactors which could put further assets at risk of impairment in the future include reductions in the Corporation’s price outlooks,\nchanges in the allocation of capital, and operating cost increases which exceed the pace of efficiencies or the pace of oil and natural\ngas price increases. However, due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity prices, and the relationship between\nindustry prices and costs, it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charges\nrelated to the Corporation’s long-lived assets. In 2019 and 2018, the before-tax impairment charges were $0.1 billion and $0.7 billion,\nrespectively.\n\nAccumulated depreciation and depletion totaled $277,769 million at the end of 2020 and $233,684 million at the end of 2019.

This reduction in demand coincided with announcements of increased production in certain key oil-producing\ncountries which led to increases in inventory levels and sharp declines in prices for crude oil, natural gas, and petroleum products.\nMarket conditions continued to reflect considerable uncertainty throughout 2020.\n\nPrimarily as a result of very low prices during 2020 and the effects of reductions in capital expenditures, under the SEC definition of\nproved reserves, certain quantities of crude oil, bitumen, and natural gas that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify\nas proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl,\n0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 billion oil-equivalent barrels in the United States. The Corporation's near-term\nreduction in capital expenditures resulted in a net reduction to estimates of proved reserves of approximately 1.5 billion oil-equivalent\nbarrels, mainly related to unconventional drilling in the United States. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts\nbeing recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, cost reductions, operating\nefficiencies, and increases in planned capital spending.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate’s participation in proved reserves and ExxonMobil’s ownership\npercentage of the proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others.
