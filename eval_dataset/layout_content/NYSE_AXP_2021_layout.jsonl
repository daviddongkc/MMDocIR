Interest expense is divided principally into two categories: (i) deposits, which primarily relates  to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt, which primarily relates to interest  expense on our long-term financing and short-term borrowings, (e.g., commercial paper, federal funds purchased, bank  overdrafts and other short-term borrowings), as well as the realized impact of derivatives hedging interest rate risk on our  long-term debt.   Interest income  — Includes (i) interest on loans, (ii) interest and dividends on investment securities and (iii) interest income  on deposits with banks and other.   Interest on loans  — Assessed using the average daily balance method for Card Member loans. Unless the loan is classified as  non-accrual, interest is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding in accordance with the terms of the  applicable account agreement until the outstanding balance is paid or written off.   Interest and dividends on investment securities  — Primarily relates to our performing fixed-income securities. Interest  income is recognized using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts, fees  and other payments, so a constant rate of return is recognized on the outstanding balance of the related investment  security throughout its term. Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it is likely that future interest  payments will not be made as scheduled.  Interest income on deposits with banks and other  — Primarily relates to the placement of cash in excess of near-term  funding requirements in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing demand and  call accounts.   Loyalty coalitions  — Programs that enable consumers to earn rewards points and use them to save on purchases from a  variety of participating merchants through multi-category rewards platforms. Merchants in these programs generally fund  the consumer offers and are responsible to us for the cost of rewards points; we earn revenue from operating the loyalty  platform and by providing marketing support.   Net card fees  — Represents the card membership fees earned during the period recognized as revenue over the covered  card membership period (typically one year), net of the provision for projected refunds for Card Membership cancellation  and deferred acquisition costs.   Net interest yield on average Card Member loans —  A non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing adjusted net interest  income by average Card Member loans, computed on an annualized basis. Reserves and net write-offs related to  uncollectible interest are recorded through provision for credit losses and are thus not included in the net interest yield  calculation.   Net write-off rate  —  principal only  — Represents the amount of proprietary consumer or small business Card Member loans  or receivables written off, consisting of principal (resulting from authorized transactions), less recoveries, as a percentage of  the average loan or receivable balance during the period.   Net write-off rate  —  principal, interest and fees  — Includes, in the calculation of the net write-off rate, amounts for interest  and fees in addition to principal for Card Member loans, and fees in addition to principal for Card Member receivables.   Network volumes  — Represents the total of billed business and processed volumes. Network volumes are reported as United  States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.   Operating expenses  — Represents salaries and employee benefits, professional services, data processing and equipment,  and other expenses.   Processed volumes  — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards issued under network  partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures, as well as alternative payment solutions  facilitated by American Express. Processed volume is reported as United States or outside the United States based on the  location of the issuer.   Reserve build (release)  — Represents the portion of the provisions for credit losses for the period related to increasing or  decreasing reserves for credit losses as a result of, among other things, changes in volumes, macroeconomic outlook,  portfolio composition and credit quality of portfolios. Reserve build represents the amount by which the provision for credit  losses exceeds net write-offs, while reserve release represents the amount by which net write-offs exceed the provision for  credit losses.

The reserves for credit losses on Card Member loans was  $\\S3.3$   billion as of December 31, 2021.  Management estimates lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and  future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period) beyond the balance sheet date. As  disclosed by management, in estimating expected credit losses, management uses a combination of statistically-based  models that entail a significant amount of judgment. The primary areas of judgment used in measuring the quantitative  components of the Company’s reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate R&S Period, the modeling of the  probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic conditions.  Management uses these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine the reserve rates  that are applied to the outstanding loan balances to produce its reserves for expected credit losses. Within the R&S Period,  the Company’s models use past loss experience and current and future economic conditions to estimate the probability of  default, exposure at default and expected recoveries to estimate net losses at default. Beyond the R&S Period, expected  credit losses are estimated by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates. Management also estimates the  likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off loans considering how long ago the loan was written off and  future economic conditions. Additionally, management evaluates whether to include qualitative reserves to cover losses  that are expected but may not be adequately represented in the quantitative methods or the economic assumptions. The  qualitative reserves address possible limitations within the models or factors not included within the models, such as  external conditions, emerging portfolio trends, the nature and size of the portfolio, portfolio concentrations, the volume and  severity of past due accounts, or management risk actions.

PAM results in the amortization of the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the related tax  credits, and recognition of the net investment performance in the statement of income as a component of Income tax  provision, while the equity method reflected losses related to the investments as a component of Other, net expenses. As a  result, we believe PAM is preferable as it better reflects the economics of our tax credit investments. Since the impact of this  change is immaterial to our prior and current year financial statements, we implemented PAM on a prospective basis which  resulted in a one-time charge to Income tax provision of  $\\S55$   million in the first quarter of 2021, reflecting the cumulative  impact of the difference in the timing of expense recognition between the equity method and PAM.
