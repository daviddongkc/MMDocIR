{"layout": 4, "type": "text", "text": "Dialog state tracking (DST) is a core compo- nent in task-oriented dialog systems. Exist- ing approaches for DST mainly fall into one of two categories, namely, ontology-based and ontology-free methods. An ontology-based method selects a value from a candidate-value list for each target slot, while an ontology-free method extracts spans from dialog contexts. Recent work introduced a BERT-based model to strike a balance between the two methods by pre-deﬁning categorical and non-categorical slots. However, it is not clear enough which slots are better handled by either of the two slot types, and the way to use the pre-trained model has not been well investigated. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective dual- strategy model for DST, by adapting a single BERT-style reading comprehension model to jointly handle both the categorical and non- categorical slots. Our experiments on the Mul- tiWOZ datasets show that our method signif- icantly outperforms the BERT-based counter- part, ﬁnding that the key is a deep interaction between the domain-slot and context informa- tion. When evaluated on noisy (MultiWOZ 2.0) and cleaner (MultiWOZ 2.1) settings, our method performs competitively and robustly across the two different settings. Our method sets the new state of the art in the noisy setting, while performing more robustly than the best model in the cleaner setting. We also conduct a comprehensive error analysis on the dataset, including the effects of the dual strategy for each slot, to facilitate future research.

{"layout": 19, "type": "text", "text": "Multi-domain DST, which tracks dialog states in complicated conversations across multiple domains with many slots, has been a hot research topic dur- ing the past few years, along with the development of Dialogue State Tracking Challenges ( Williams et al. ,  2013 ;  Henderson et al. ,  2014a , b ;  Kim et al. , 2016 ,  2017 ,  2019 ). Traditional approaches usually rely on hand-crafted features or domain-speciﬁc lexicon ( Henderson et al. ,  $2014\\mathrm{c}$  ;  Wen et al. ,  2016 ), making them difﬁcult to be adapted to new domains. In addition, these approaches require a pre-deﬁned full ontology, in which the values of a slot are con- strained by a set of candidate values ( Ramadan et al. ,  2018 ;  Liu and Lane ,  2017 ;  Zhong et al. , 2018 ;  Lee et al. ,  2019 ;  Chen et al. ,  2020 ). To tackle these issues, several methods have been proposed to extract slot values through span matching with start and end positions in the dialog context. For example, ( Xu and Hu ,  2018 ) utilizes an attention- based pointer network to copy values from the di- alog context. ( Gao et al. ,  2019b ) poses DST as a reading comprehension problem and incorporates a slot carryover model to copy states from previ- ous conversational turns. However, tracking states only from the dialog context is insufﬁcient since many values in DST cannot be exactly found in the context due to annotation errors or diverse descrip- tions of slot values from users. On the other hand, pre-trained models such as BERT ( Devlin et al. , 2019 ) and GPT ( Radford et al. ,  2018 ) have shown promising performances in many downstream tasks. Among them, DSTreader ( Gao et al. ,  2019b ) uti- lizes BERT as word embeddings for dialog con- texts, SUMBT ( Lee et al. ,  2019 ) employs BERT to extract representations of candidate values, and BERT-DST ( Rastogi et al. ,  2020 ) adopts BERT to encode the inputs of the user turn as well as the previous system turn. Different from these ap- proaches where the dialog context and domain-slot pairs are usually separately encoded, we employ strong interactions to encode them. 1 .

However, such generative methods suffer from generating ill-formatted strings (e.g., repeated words) upon long strings, which is common in DST. For example, the hotel address may be long and a small difference makes the whole dialog state tracking incorrect.

As we can see in this table, the two methods dra- matically reduce the errors for some slots such as attraction-type ,  hotel-internet  and  hotel-parking Hence, for these kinds of slots, it is better to treat them as categorical slots. Among the top-10 slots, the  time -related slots such as  taxi-leave at  and  train- arrive by , which are span-based slots in DS-DST, DS-Span and DS-DST cannot perform well as there are no span matching in the dialogue context, and only few values (i.e., ‘ none ’ and ‘ dontcare ’) can be correctly predicted by the slot-gate classiﬁcation.

In the third example, all the predictions are semantically correct; however, in terms of the string match, only DS-Picklist can correctly predict the value. The two other methods rely on span extraction.
