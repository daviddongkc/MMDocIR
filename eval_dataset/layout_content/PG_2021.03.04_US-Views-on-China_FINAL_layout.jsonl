The first is a “feeling thermometer,” which asks people to evaluate their opinion of China  on a 0 to 100 scale, where a rating of 51 or higher is “warm,” 50 is neutral and below 50 is  “cold.” This question, which is the predominant focus of this report, was previously asked on the  ATP in 2018 and 2016. Looking at these three points in time, we can see that the sharp  increase in negative views of China that we have been documenting via our phone surveys is  also evident via these online surveys. On this measure, those who say they are “cold” (0-49)  toward China has increased from   $46\\%$   in 2018 to  $67\\%$   in 2021, or 21 percentage points.
