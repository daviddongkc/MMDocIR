PMI is a leading international tobacco company engaged in the  manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories,  and other nicotine-containing products in markets outside the U.S. In addition, PMI ships versions of its  IQOS  Platform  1 device and consumables to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the U.S., where these products have received  marketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the premarket tobacco product  application (PMTA) pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of  IQOS  and its consumables as a  Modified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate  to promote the public health. PMI is building a future on a new category of smoke-free products that, while not risk  free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Through multidisciplinary capabilities in product development,  state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, PMI aims to ensure that its smoke-free products meet adult  consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements. PMI’s smoke-free product portfolio includes heat-not-burn  and nicotine-containing vapor products. As of December 31, 2020,  IQOS  is available for sale in 64 markets in key cities or  nationwide, and PMI estimates that approximately 12.7 million adults around the world have already switched to  IQOS   and stopped smoking.

While the company has the option to perform  a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an  impairment exists, the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis.  The impairment  analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the  carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair  value of goodwill, we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco  industry, supported by a discounted cash flow model.  At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our goodwill was \\$6.0 billion,  which is related to ten reporting units, each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic  characteristics.  The estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2020.  To  determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from- royalty method.

{"layout": 977, "type": "text", "text": "PMI operates in markets outside of the United States of America, with manufacturing and sales facilities in various locations around  the world.  PMI utilizes certain financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposure.  Derivative financial  instruments are used by PMI principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange  and interest rates by creating offsetting exposures.  PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative  financial instruments for speculative purposes.  Substantially all of PMI's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting  arrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default by a participating party.  While these contracts contain the  enforceable right to offset through close-out netting rights, PMI elects to present them on a gross basis in the consolidated balance  sheets.  Collateral associated with these arrangements is in the form of cash and is unrestricted.  Financial instruments qualifying for  hedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at  inception and throughout the hedged period.  PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments  and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of  assessing hedge effectiveness.  Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of  the forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur.  If it were  deemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings.

(“RBH”), and the other defendants, JTI Macdonald Corp., and Imperial Tobacco Canada Limited,  sought protection in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under the Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (“CCAA”) on March 22,  March 8, and March 12, 2019 respectively.  CCAA is a Canadian federal law that permits a Canadian business to restructure its affairs  while carrying on its business in the ordinary course.  The initial CCAA order made by the Ontario Superior Court on March 22, 2019  authorizes RBH to pay all expenses incurred in carrying on its business in the ordinary course after the CCAA filing, including  obligations to employees, vendors, and suppliers.  As further described in Note 20.  Deconsolidation of RBH , RBH is now  deconsolidated from our consolidated financial statements. As part of the CCAA proceedings, there is currently a comprehensive stay  up to and including March 31, 2021 of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada against RBH and the other defendants,  including PMI and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), namely, the smoking and health class actions filed in various Canadian  provinces and health care cost recovery actions.  These proceedings are presented below under the caption “ Stayed Litigation —  Canada .” Ernst & Young Inc. has been appointed as monitor of RBH in the CCAA proceedings.  In accordance with the CCAA  process, as the parties work towards a plan of arrangement or compromise in a confidential mediation, it is anticipated that the court  will set additional hearings and further extend the stay of proceedings. On April 17, 2019, the Ontario Superior Court ruled that RBH  and the other defendants will not be allowed to file an application to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to appeal the Court of  Appeal’s decision in the  Létourneau  and the  Blais  cases so long as the comprehensive stay of all tobacco-related litigation in Canada  remains in effect and that the time period to file the application would be extended by the stay period. While RBH believes that the  findings of liability and damages in both  Létourneau  and the  Blais  cases were incorrect, the CCAA proceedings will provide a forum  for RBH to seek resolution through a plan of arrangement or compromise of all tobacco-related litigation pending in Canada.

Imperial Tobacco  Ltd.,   Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada , filed in November 1998, RBH  and other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti- smoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who  allegedly suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27,  2015.  The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members’ compensatory  damages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately   $\\S12.1$   billion). The trial court  awarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating   $20\\%$   to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1  billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately   $\\S2.4$   billion)). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD 90,000 (approximately   $\\mathbb{S}70{,}250)$  ) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 30,000 (approximately  $\\S23{,}400)$  ) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at  99,957 members.  RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish  security totaling CAD 226 million (approximately  $\\S176.4$   million) to cover both the  Létourneau  and  Blais  cases, which RBH has paid  in installments through March 2017.  The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD  758 million (approximately   $\\S592$   million) in installments through June 2017.  JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish  security in accordance with plaintiffs’ motion.  The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the  Court of Appeal affirming the trial court’s judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal. On March 1, 2019, the Court of  Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award  while reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD 13.5 billion including interest (approximately   $\\S10.5$    billion) due to the trial court’s error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with  an allocation of   $20\\%$   to RBH (approximately CAD 2.7 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately   $\\mathbb{S}2.11$   billion)). The  Court of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human  Rights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by  conspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either  need not prove, or had adequately proven, that these faults were a cause of the class members’ injuries.  In accordance with the  judgment, defendants are required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the  Létourneau  case described  below and the  Blais  case, approximately CAD 1.1 billion (approximately \\$859 million), into trust accounts within 60 days.  RBH’s  share of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million (approximately   $\\S194$   million).  PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of   $\\S194$   million  in its consolidated results, representing  $\\S142$   million net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related expense, in the first quarter of 2019.  The  charge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the  deconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.

The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and  punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court  issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of  CAD 131 million (approximately   $\\S102.3$   million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 46 million (approximately   $\\S36$   million) to  RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at 918,000 members but declined to award compensatory damages to the  addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy.
