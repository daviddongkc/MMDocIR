Fraudulent elections to select a  county seat might be followed by theft of the  county records, showdowns, court battles,  56 and more thefts of records.”  To a large  degree, Hamilton County’s eventual  selection of Aurora matches Bal tens per ger’s  description. Orville City, which had been  surveyed and recorded in 1870 and located  on the West Blue River, was selected in  1871 as Hamilton County’s first seat of  government. That distinction would not last  long. Soon after establishing Orville City in  the county’s southeastern portion as the  county seat, a group of citizens started to  protest the selection, calling for a more  central location. In the “first election Aurora  received over two-thirds of the votes cast,  which was the necessary majority at that  time, but the commissioners would not order  the removal” because the results were  deemed illegal.  Another vote was held in  1874, where 399-1/2 votes were required for  victory. In that contest Aurora collected 399  votes, Hamilton 147, and Orville City just  53. By law, Aurora had failed to meet the  required number; however, Aurora  “im prudently organized a company of some  150 of her citizens and friends and went to  Orville City, and by violence and force took  possession of the county court house and  loaded up the records and safes and brought  58 them to Aurora.”  A “writ of mandamus  compelled them to be taken back to the  59 county seat the following spring.”  Soon  thereafter, Darius Wilcox (one of Aurora’s  original town founders) visited Lincoln and  successfully lobbied the state legislature to  change the requirement to three-fifths of  votes cast to change county seats. In May a  special election was called, although by this  time Hamilton, Nebraska, was making a  legitimate challenge for the county seat.  County historian Bremer (1967) refers to  Hamilton as Aurora’s “bitter enemy” and the  “strongest contender in the three-cornered  contest” for county seat.  In the May  election Aurora won by a small majority and  in June another election was held and  Hamilton won by a slim margin. The fifth  and final vote based on a pure majority (half  plus one) was held in October of 1875. At  this election, Aurora received 481 votes and  Hamilton 400; hence, Aurora officially  became the seat of government in early  1876. Soon after the election Hamilton and  Orville both merged with Aurora, and  Hamilton quickly became a “deserted  61  village.” ", "page_idx": 17, "bbox": [72, 211.36669921875, 290, 716.595947265625], "page_size": [612.0, 792.0]}
