The latter (with its subordinate marl-slate) rests, the very irregular and sometimes absent yellow sands of the Permian alone inter- vening, upon a denuded surface of Coal-Measures. The total thickness of the Magnesian Limestone at its maximum may be estimated as being not much over 60o feet,but at Sunderland the uppermost portion of the deposit is absent.The amount of that rock present there is between 300 and 400 feet. There is very little southerly dip in the limestone, but there is some, and the best way to ascertain the nature of those portions which underlie the town is therefore to study the beds as they crop out in the beautiful cliff sections to the north, between the Wear and the Tyne. These rocks are so strange in structure, and so striking by reason of the variety of their forms, that they have been described in many raluable papers, by the late Professor Sedgwick, Mr. R. Howse, Mr. J. W. Kirkby, and others.\\* It is not intended in the present paper to repeat what has been so well and so often·said before, but simply to draw special atten- tion to one of the strangest and most striking of the developments of the Magnesian Iimestone as displayed in Marsden Bay.

{"layout": 47, "type": "text", "text": "That the Magnesia n Limestone is riddled with cavities of every size and shape is locally matter of common knowledge.Nor can it be said that the origin of many of these cavities is difficult totrace.In some cases the smaller of them are due tothe original“vuggy”or cellular character of the stone-  $\\mathbf{\\cdot}\\mathbf{\\mathfrak{a}}$  character which is intimately related to its eminently water-holding qualities.But the larger cavities are often true caverns formed by the double action of mechanical and chemical agencies, and that these agencies are still at work in the manufacture of such carerns there is abundant eri den ce toshow.How readily the Magnesia n Limestone is acted on by mechanical agents of den ud ation and waste is shown by the numerous caves along the shore.All these combine the typical characters of seu-caves as enumerated by Professor W.Boyd Dawkins,F.R.S.,viz., they have fat or scarcely sloping foors, and are usually widest below.They seldom penetrate far into the cliff,andtheir entrances are in the same horizontal plane(that of the beach at high- waterline,whether that beach be the present one,or an ancient one or raisrd beach).\\*Such caves are evidently to a much greater degree the work ofthe moving shingle and sandthan of theacid-water towhich they nevertheless in some slight degree also owe their production.But these sea-margin caverns are insignificant when compared with the countless gullies, gashes, and holes of every description which cut the internal body of the limestone through and through.Thehistory of thelatter is different. Many of them may be accounted for by noting how frequently masses both large and small and of the most irregular forms of soft pulver u lent earthy matter occur in the midst of the hardest and most compact portions of the limestone.An afternoon's walk along the face of the South Shields quarries, between that town and Marsden Bay, will render this sudden utter change of texture in the stone patent to any one.How easily such soft and incoherent material can be removed by the merest percolation of rain-water needs no proof, and that caverns would result and have resulted from such removal is alsoclear.This action is indeed chiefly mechanical, but there is also going on at the same time in the limestone a continual destruction of its substance as rock by the purely chemical ordinary action of rain-water on limestone. How great this action really is may perhaps be best understood when it is stated that in every thousand gallons of Sunderland water there is nearly one pound of lime and magnesia; or, in other words, every thousand gallons of that water pumped up represents a pound weight of rock abstracted.t In the course of 8 year the amount of hard compact Mag- nesian Limestone carried away by the Water Company's works would not fall much short of forty cubic yards. If to this be added the amount of water similarly charged with lime and magnesia, which runs off to the sea from springs, streams, and rivers, the enormous amount of stone annually lost by the Permian series in East Durham can be better imagined than represented by figures.A cubic foot of Magnesian Lime- stone of the less crystalline ra rie ties when saturated holds from  $\\pmb{\\mathfrak{s}}\\mathbf{\\cdot}\\pmb{\\mathfrak{s}}\\mathfrak{$  1b8. to 17 lbs.of water; the crystalline forms hold very little.f This bears out the etatement made twenty years ago in these Transactions by Messrs.

{"layout": 74, "type": "text", "text": "Professor LEBouR said,the first question asked was whether he did notthink that thewater being lowered would make such falls more likely? Most undoubtedly it would;and thiswasone of the arguments in his paper. The water, of course, helped to support the walls where it filled these gullets, and when the water was withdrawn, so much support was also withdrawn from the walls, and they were more apt to collapse.  If any one could give any clear and distinct information thatsuch a tremendous rise and fall of water,as mentioned by Mr.Parrington,took place by the action of the Water Company pumping,that would show excellent cause for the increased occurrence of such falls of stone.The last speaker askedwhy he (Professor Lebour) thought these falls would happen more frequently in the future. Simply because these gullets were slowly becoming larger and larger daily.It was fortunate that they had Mr. Forster and Mr.Daglish present on this occasion,as they were the authors of, he might say,the best paper on the limestone of Durham which had appeared in the Transactions on this subject. Professor Merivale asked why Breccia- gashes were pointed at the bottom. It was because they were to all intents and purposes water channels.The tendency ofwater was to fall to a lower level, and to dig a channel deeper and deeper. There was among these gullets a kind of underground river-system,thoughnot always atthe samelevel—akind of many storied water-system,flowing one into the other, but all tending to the sea. It would be interesting to get the details as to the great fall of water mentioned by Mr. Parrington. There was no reason, without giving up an inch of his own theory, why he should not adopt Mr. Parrington's. If mining engineers said that the lowering of the level of the water by the Water Company or others pumping was liable to make thewater-blasts,he(Professor Lebour) was willing to accept that; and that might account for the great noises heard in connection with tl he earth-shakes in Sunderland.But this did not in the slightest degree militate against the explanation he had brought fur ward.
