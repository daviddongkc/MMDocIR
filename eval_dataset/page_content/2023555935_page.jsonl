This means that the UK conducts border checks in these countries, and that passengers  undergo immigration checks by the Border Force prior to entering the UK. The agreement is  reciprocal, and French officers conduct similar entry checks in the UK.  The agreement for  juxtaposed border controls has been expanded to include Belgium and the Netherlands.   \nThe intent of removing immigration controls from arrival on the UK side of the tunnel was to  speed up entry and exit times 10  and to avoid lines that disrupt carriers’ timetables, and  subsequently journey times,  between France and the UK, which in turn has enabled transport  providers to offer more services.  An issue with irregular migrants attempting to enter the UK  from France resulted in a number of new agreements,  with pledges of significant sums from the  UK to introduce measures and provide human resources at the French border to help tackle  this issue.
