It consists of three columns: \n\n1. The first column lists various names, which seem to represent different groups or categories (e.g., \"Kumal,\" \"Kanu,\" \"Rajbanshi,\" etc.).\n2.

According to the data:\n\n- Non-Madhesi make up 64.7% of the population.\n- Madhesi make up 35.3% of the population.\n- The total percentage is 100%, indicating that these are the only two groups under consideration in this distribution.\nThe table below shows the religious composition of the sample of the threewaves. \nThe table displays the percentage of the population adhering to different religions over two time points. The left column indicates the percentage at an unspecified earlier time, while the right column specifies the percentage as of September 2014.
