Transitional justice refers to a range of measures—judicial and non-judicial, formal and  informal, retributive and restorative—employed by countries transitioning out of armed  conflict or repressive regimes to redress legacies of atrocities and to promote long-term,  sustainable peace. Meaningful and impactful transitional justice requires a holistic  approach utilizing a range of transitional justice mechanisms including criminal  accountability, truth-telling, reparation, institutional reform, memorialization, and other  guarantees of non-recurrence of atrocities. GCJ uses its technical expertise to advance  these policy priorities through interagency coordination, targeting programming, and  engagement with and capacity building of host governments, civil society actors, and  multilateral institutions.  \nBureau Objective 2.1:    Strengthen the technical, legal, and institutional capacity and political  will of relevant governments to create and implement holistic transitional justice strategies     and mechanisms involving judicial and non-judicial strategies that provide justice for victims,  hold perpetrators accountable, and take steps to prevent the recurrence of atrocities by  addressing the root causes of past abuse.  \n  Bureau Objective 2.1 Justification and Linkages:       Responding to legacies of    atrocities through justice and accountability is something countries (it is hoped) deal  with rarely; as a result, most countries lack the domestic expertise and experience to  address these issues in a way that reflects, and builds on, international best practice and  experience. Countries facing these issues are also likely confronting significant resource  constraints as they seek to emerge from conflict and repression. They therefore often  need international assistance to respond in a way that will best support long-term peace  and   stability.    GCJ’s efforts in   this regard   are   aligned   with   the   INSSG’s commitment to   “reclaim our place in   international institutions … and   revitalize America’s unmatched   network   of   alliances and   partnerships,”   and with 2022 JSP Strategic Goal 1 (including  \n  Approved: May 5, 2022  "}

Specifically, staff members raised concerns that\n“communication and information flow worsened [...] causing employee uncertainty\nabout leadership’s goals and priorities; leadership cut off or excluded staff members\nfrom office discussions and did not advise staff of essential information they needed to\ndo their jobs [...] and hiring decisions lacked transparency and created perceptions of\nunfairness, bias, or discrimination in hiring new staff, which fueled mistrust and was\ndemoralizing.” The Report also found that the acting Senior Official, who has since left,\ntook steps to improve information sharing, collaboration, and communication. This\nManagement Objective is necessary to ensure GCJ’s maximal effectiveness, improve\nworkforce culture and morale, restore trust, and ensure that changes in “tone at the\ntop” instituted by the new Senior Bureau Official are carried through by other senior\nmanagement.

GCJ leadership will launch a confidential climate\nsurvey through the Department’s Ombudsperson to gauge the staff’s views on office\nstructure and dynamics to ensure that these facilitate their work and leave them feeling\nempowered professionally. GCJ leadership will consult broadly with staff on key\nstrategy and staffing decisions, ensure clear and timely communications to staff on all\nissues related to their work and portfolios and include a diverse range of staff on hiring\n\npanels.\n\nApproved: May 5, 2022\n\nFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n", "vlm_text": "•   Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 2 Justification and Linkages:  A June 2021  report on GCJ issued by the Office of the Inspector General found that the previous  Ambassador at Large and the current Office Director “did   not   communicate and   collaborate with   most   of   the   office’s staff   … [and   did   not] encourage an   atmosphere of  open   dialogue   and   trust   … which   contributed   to   divisions mistrust,   and   morale problems  in   the office.” (ISP-I-21-28, June 2021). Specifically, staff members raised concerns that  “communication and   information   flow   worsened   […] causing employee uncertainty  about leadership’s   goals and   priorities; leadership cut off or excluded staff members  from office discussions and did not advise staff of essential information they needed to  do their   jobs […] and   hiring decisions lacked   transparency and   created   perceptions of   unfairness, bias, or discrimination in hiring new staff, which fueled mistrust and was  demoralizing.”   The Report also found that the acting Senior Official, who has since left,  took steps to improve information sharing, collaboration, and communication. This  Management   Objective is necessary to ensure GCJ’s maximal effectiveness, improve  workforce culture and morale, restore trust, and   ensure   that   changes in   “tone at   the  top”   instituted   by the new   Senior   Bureau   Official are   carried   through   by other   senior   management. This Management Objective is justified by 3 Foreign Affairs Manual 1214.   \n\n •   Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 2 Risk Considerations:    Not achieving    this objective will significantly affect the morale of the office and may result in  experienced staff leaving GCJ. It will also decrease the effectiveness of   GCJ’s small team  \nto achieve its considerable mandate. GCJ leadership will launch a confidential climate  survey through   the   Department’s Ombudsperson   to gauge the   staff’s   views on   office  structure and dynamics to ensure that these facilitate their work and leave them feeling  empowered professionally.  GCJ leadership will consult broadly with staff on key  strategy and staffing decisions, ensure clear and timely communications to staff on all  issues related to their work and portfolios and include a diverse range of staff on hiring  panels.
