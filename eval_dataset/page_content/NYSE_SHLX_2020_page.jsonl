Some crude oil\nalso moves on our offshore pipelines under posted tariffs, which may be indexed annually.

As\naresult, FERC adopted an indexing rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows common carriers to change their rates within prescribed ceiling\nlevels that are tied to changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (““PPI-FG”).

A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling,\nbut it is permitted to do so; however, a pipeline must reduce its indexed rates to the extent they exceed the index ceiling when a negative index applies.\nSome indexed rates on our systems were reduced in 2016 in response to the negative index lowering the ceiling, such as certain spot rates on Zydeco. Rate\nincreases made under the index methodology are presumed to be just and reasonable and require a protesting party to demonstrate that the portion of the\nrate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs. Despite these procedural limits on\nchallenging the indexing of rates, the overall rates are not entitled to any specific protection against rate challenges. Under the indexing rate methodology,\nin any year in which the index is negative, pipelines must file to lower their rates if those rates would otherwise be above the rate ceiling.\n\nWhile common carrier pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, common carrier pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by\nusing other methodologies such as cost-of-service rate making, market-based rates and settlement rates. A common carrier pipeline can propose a cost-of-\nservice approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling (or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to the reduced rate ceiling), but must\nestablish that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing\nmethodology. A common carrier can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. A common\ncarrier can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. Rates for a new service on a common carrier pipeline can be established\nthrough a negotiated rate with an unaffiliated shipper or via a cost-of-service approach.\n\nThe rates shown in our FERC tariffs have been established using the indexing methodology, by settlement or by negotiation. If we used cost-of-service rate\nmaking to establish or support our rates on our different pipeline systems, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise.\nIn 2005, FERC issued a policy statement stating that it would permit common carrier pipelines, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost-\nof-service rates to reflect the tax liability attributable to a regulated entity’s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC’s policy, a\ntax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on\nthe regulated entity’s income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have such income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although\nthis policy is generally favorable for common carrier pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to FERC’s case-by-\ncase review approach and recent changes to FERC’s policy following litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, as described below. The\napplication of this policy, as well as any decision by FERC regarding our cost of service, is also subject to review in the courts.\n\nUnder its current policy, FERC permits regulated interstate oil and gas pipelines to include an income tax allowance in their cost of service used to\ncalculate cost-based transportation rates. The allowance is intended to reflect the tax liability attributable to the regulated entity’s operating income,\nregardless of the form of ownership. On July 1, 2016, in United Airlines, Inc. v. FERC, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated a\npair of FERC orders to the extent they permitted an interstate refined petroleum products pipeline owned by a master limited partnership (“MLP”) to\ninclude an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. The D.C. Circuit held that FERC had failed to demonstrate that the inclusion of an income tax\nallowance in the pipeline’s rates would not lead to an over-recovery of costs attributable to regulated service. The D.C. Circuit instructed FERC on remand\nto fashion a remedy to ensure that the pipeline’s rates do not allow it to over-recover its costs. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision, FERC issued its\nRevised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes in\n\n15\n", "vlm_text": "the complainant was contractually barred from challenging the rate prior to enactment of EPAct and filed the complaint within 30 days of the expiration of the contractual bar; or a provision of the tariff is unduly discriminatory or preferential. \nEPAct required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable methodology to adjust tariff rates for inflation for interstate petroleum pipelines.

Rates for a new service on a common carrier pipeline can be established through a negotiated rate with an unaffiliated shipper or via a cost-of-service approach. \nThe rates shown in our FERC tariffs have been established using the indexing methodology, by settlement or by negotiation. If we used cost-of-service rate making to establish or support our rates on our different pipeline systems, the issue of the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes could arise. In 2005, FERC issued a policy statement stating that it would permit common carrier pipelines, among others, to include an income tax allowance in cost- of-service rates to reflect the tax liability attributable to a regulated entity’s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. Under FERC’s policy, a tax pass-through entity seeking such an income tax allowance must establish that its partners or members have an actual or potential income tax liability on the regulated entity’s income. Whether a pipeline’s owners have such income tax liability is subject to review by FERC on a case-by-case basis. Although this policy is generally favorable for common carrier pipelines that are organized as pass-through entities, it still entails rate risk due to FERC’s case-by- case review approach and recent changes to FERC’s policy following litigation in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, as described below. The application of this policy, as well as any decision by FERC regarding our cost of service, is also subject to review in the courts. \nUnder its current policy, FERC permits regulated interstate oil and gas pipelines to include an income tax allowance in their cost of service used to calculate cost-based transportation rates. The allowance is intended to reflect the tax liability attributable to the regulated entity’s operating income, regardless of the form of ownership. On July 1, 2016, in United Airlines, Inc. v. FERC, the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated a pair of FERC orders to the extent they permitted an interstate refined petroleum products pipeline owned by a master limited partnership (“MLP”) to include an income tax allowance in its cost-of-service rates. The D.C. Circuit held that FERC had failed to demonstrate that the inclusion of an income tax allowance in the pipeline’s rates would not lead to an over-recovery of costs attributable to regulated service. The D.C. Circuit instructed FERC on remand to fashion a remedy to ensure that the pipeline’s rates do not allow it to over-recover its costs. Following the D.C. Circuit’s decision, FERC issued its Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes in "}

As with the industry in general, compliance with existing and\nanticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, including our capital costs to construct, maintain, operate and\nupgrade equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we believe they do not\naffect our competitive position, as the operations of our competitors are similarly affected. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with\napplicable environmental laws and regulations. However, these laws and regulations are subject to changes, or to changes in the interpretation of such laws\nand regulations, by regulatory authorities, and continued and future compliance with such laws and regulations may require us to incur significant\nexpenditures. Additionally, violation of environmental laws, regulations and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative, civil and\ncriminal penalties, injunctions limiting our operations, investigatory or remedial liabilities or construction bans or delays in the construction of additional\nfacilities or equipment. Additionally, a release of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could, to the extent the event is not insured,\nsubject us to substantial expenses, including costs to comply with applicable laws and regulations and to resolve claims by third parties for personal injury\nor property damage or claims by the U.S. federal government or state governments for natural resources damages. These impacts could directly and\nindirectly affect our business and have an adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity if we do not recover these\nexpenditures through the rates and fees we receive for our services. We believe our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and\nregulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of\ncompetitor and location of its operating facilities.\n\nWe accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably\nestimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of\nthose previously accrued may be required. New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the\nfuture. We believe we substantially comply with all legal requirements regarding the environment; however, as not all of the associated costs are fixed or\npresently determinable (even under existing legislation) and may be affected by future legislation or regulations, it is not possible to predict all of the\nultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.\n\nAir Emissions and Climate Change. Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act and its regulations and comparable state and local statutes and\nregulations in connection with air emissions from our operations. Under these laws, permits may be required before construction can commence on a new\nsource of potentially significant air emissions, and operating permits may be required for sources that are already constructed.

Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act\nof 1972 (“Clean Water Act”), Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) and state laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control\nand countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the\nevent of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”)\nplans at many of our facilities. We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of\nthe Clean Water Act and have implemented tracking systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws\nrequire individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. We believe we are in\nsubstantial compliance with applicable storm water permitting requirements.\n\nIn addition, the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of\nOPA-90 and related state requirements. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an\nemergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay\nresulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate\nfacilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and\nfacilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established SPCC plans for facilities subject to Clean Water Act SPCC requirements.\n\nConstruction or maintenance of our pipelines, tank farms and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are also regulated under the Clean Water Act\nby the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands (including associated mitigation projects) may result in\nthe delay of our pipeline projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. In 2014, the EPA\nand the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations that expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act\nand its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule was stayed by the courts pending a substantive\ndecision on the merits. In October 2019, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 regulations and reinstated\nthe agencies’ narrower pre-2015 scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. In April 2020, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a new\nfinal “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction than\ncontemplated under the 2015 WOTUS definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction.\nJudicial challenges to the EPA’s October 2019 and April 2020 final rules are currently before multiple federal district courts. If the rules are vacated and the\n2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of Clean Water Act jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance, as well as increased\nmonitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.\n\nIn an April 15, 2020 ruling, amended May 11, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana issued an order invalidating the U.S. Army Corps of\nEngineers (the “Corps”) 2017 reissuance of Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), the general permit governing dredge-and-fill activities for pipeline and\nother utility line construction projects, to the extent it was used to authorize construction of new oil and gas pipelines. Environmental groups had alleged\nthat the Corps failed to consult with federal wildlife agencies as required by the Endangered Species Act. The court’s decision vacated NWP 12 until the\nCorps completes consultation with the applicable federal wildlife agencies. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted in part and denied in part the\nCorps’ request to stay the U.S. District Court’s decision. The Supreme Court’s decision allows the use of NWP 12 as to construction of new oil and gas\npipelines, pending the outcome of the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and any subsequent petition for review to the U.S. Supreme\nCourt. In addition, in January 2021, the EPA and the Corps issued a final rule reissuing and restricting NWP 12 to oil and gas pipelines. However, the NWP\nrulemaking is among the agency actions listed for review in accordance with the January 20, 2021 Executive Order: “Protecting Public Health and the\nEnvironment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.” Limitations on the use of NWP 12 may make it more difficult to permit our projects and\ncould cause us to lose potential and current customers and limit our growth and revenue.\n\nWorkplace Safety.

Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants, including crude oil and refined products. Regulations under the Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 (“Clean Water Act”), Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) and state laws impose regulatory burdens on our operations. Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require containment to mitigate or prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow, rupture or leak. For example, the Clean Water Act requires us to maintain Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (“SPCC”) plans at many of our facilities. We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the Clean Water Act and have implemented tracking systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. We believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable storm water permitting requirements. \nIn addition, the transportation and storage of crude oil and refined products over and adjacent to water involves risk and subjects us to the provisions of OPA-90 and related state requirements. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate facilities at which releases of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established SPCC plans for facilities subject to Clean Water Act SPCC requirements. \nConstruction or maintenance of our pipelines, tank farms and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are also regulated under the Clean Water Act by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our pipeline projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations that expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule was stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. In October 2019, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 regulations and reinstated the agencies’ narrower pre-2015 scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. In April 2020, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a new final “waters of the United States” (“WOTUS”) definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction than contemplated under the 2015 WOTUS definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal Clean Water Act jurisdiction. Judicial challenges to the EPA’s October 2019 and April 2020 final rules are currently before multiple federal district courts. If the rules are vacated and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of Clean Water Act jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance, as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities. \nIn an April 15, 2020 ruling, amended May 11, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana issued an order invalidating the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “Corps”) 2017 reissuance of Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), the general permit governing dredge-and-fill activities for pipeline and other utility line construction projects, to the extent it was used to authorize construction of new oil and gas pipelines. Environmental groups had alleged that the Corps failed to consult with federal wildlife agencies as required by the Endangered Species Act. The court’s decision vacated NWP 12 until the Corps completes consultation with the applicable federal wildlife agencies. On July 6, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted in part and denied in part the Corps’ request to stay the U.S. District Court’s decision.

A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations and on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days, which may cover our offshore pipeline permits. Finally, our ability to secure required permits may be inhibited by increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety requirements, negative public perception or opposition from political activists through protests or other means, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. \nThe tariff rates and rules and regulations for service of our regulated assets, as well as our business practices for our regulated assets, are subject to review, audit and possible adjustment by federal and state regulators, which could adversely affect our revenue and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. \nWe provide both interstate and intrastate transportation services for refined products and crude oil. Our interstate and intrastate pipelines are common carriers and are required to provide service to any shipper similarly situated to an existing shipper that requests transportation services on our pipelines. \nZydeco, Bengal, Colonial, LOCAP, Explorer and portions of Mars provide interstate transportation services that are subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA. FERC uses prescribed rate methodologies for developing and changing regulated rates for interstate pipelines. Shippers may protest (and FERC may investigate) the lawfulness of new or changed tariff rates, or may file a complaint against existing tariff rates. FERC can suspend new or changed tariff rates, rules and regulations for up to seven months and can allow new rates to be implemented subject to refund of amounts collected in excess of the rate ultimately found to be just and reasonable. Shippers may also file complaints that existing rates are unjust and unreasonable. If FERC finds a rate to be unjust and unreasonable, it may order payment of reparations for up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint or investigation, and FERC may prescribe new rates prospectively.

These complaints have been consolidated by FERC in Docket\nNos. OR18-7-002, et al. and were set for hearing and settlement judge procedures. FERC also severed the review of Colonial’s market-based rates into a\nseparate, concurrent hearing. On May 2, 2019, the Chief Administrative Law Judge terminated settlement judge procedures and established a procedural\nschedule for a hearing before an administrative law judge. The hearing took place in the latter part of 2020 and an initial decision from the administrative\nlaw judge is currently scheduled for August 2021, with a FERC decision anticipated by spring 2022. Since the consolidated complaint proceedings are\nongoing, FERC has not taken any final action on the complaints and the outcome is not known at this time. If Colonial is unable to recover its full cost-of-\nservice as a result of the rates established in this proceeding, is no longer able to charge market-based rates or has its procedures and charges related to\ntransmix and product volume loss modified in a way that is adverse to Colonial, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operation and\nability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\n\nOn December 22, 2017, federal legislation known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”) was enacted, which made various changes to the U.S. tax\nlaws, including reducing the highest marginal U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017,\nadjusting the individual income tax brackets and establishing limited deductions for certain income from “pass-through” entities. In the Revised Policy\nStatement, FERC states that it would address the effect of the tax changes on industry-wide oil pipeline costs in the five-year review of the oil pipeline\nindex level, which commenced in 2020. As with the corporate income tax rate reduction, FERC also has announced that it would take the MLP income tax\nallowance elimination into account in the next five-year review of indexed rates in 2020. Both of these factors were considered as part of the order on the\nfive-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the income tax allowance\nelimination in setting the new indexing adjustment. Separately, FERC also could require oil pipelines to revise their rates in individual proceedings\n(including initial rate filing or complaint proceedings) or through other action.

FERC and most state agencies support light-handed regulation of common carrier pipelines and have generally not investigated the\nrates, terms and conditions of service of pipelines in the absence of shipper protests or complaints, and generally resolve matters informally.

Similarly, if, due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason,\nany of our customers or other counterparties were to seek to assert any force majeure or similar provision in its contract with us or other contractual\ndefenses to performance available to them, including the doctrine of impossibility, impracticability of performance, frustration of performance and others, a\ncourt could excuse some or all of such customer’s or counterparty’s performance under its contract with us. For certain of our pipelines, we may have a\nlimited pool of potential customers and may be unable to replace any customers who default on their obligations to us. Therefore, any material deterioration\nin the creditworthiness of our customers or any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\n\nIn addition, we are subject to political and economic risks that impact our customers. For example, the U.S. has gradually expanded sanctions that have\nimpacted Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PdVSA”) and its subsidiaries as well as the Government of Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, the Trump\nAdministration designated PdVSA on the Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s\nOffice of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”). As a result, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with PdVSA and its majority-\nowned subsidiaries. Certain of our customers are subsidiaries of PdVSA and, as a result, we and certain of our customers may be impacted if the General\nLicenses allowing for the temporary continuation of operations or engagements with PdVSA and its majority-owned subsidiaries expire in the future.\nTherefore, absent further action by the U.S. government and OFAC, the loss of customers as a result of the sanctions could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.\n\n36\n", "vlm_text": "In some cases, our assets include partial ownership interests in joint ventures. If a sufficient amount of our assets, or other assets acquired in the future, are deemed to be “investment securities” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, we may have to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, claim an exemption, obtain exemptive relief from the SEC or modify our organizational structure or our contract rights. Registering as an investment company could, among other things, materially limit our ability to engage in transactions with affiliates, including the purchase and sale of certain securities or other property to or from our affiliates, restrict our ability to borrow funds or engage in other transactions involving leverage and require us to add additional directors who are independent of us or our affiliates. The occurrence of some or all of these events would adversely affect the price of our common units and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. \nRisks Related to Our Customers and Counterparties \nOur ability to renew or replace our third-party contract portfolio on comparable terms could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to make distributions. \nAs portions of our third-party contract portfolio come up for replacement or renewal, and capacity becomes available, adverse market conditions may prevent us from replacing or renewing the contracts on comparable terms. For example, two of our transportation services agreements on the Zydeco system expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and have not been replaced. \nOur ability to achieve favorable terms when replacing these or other expiring contracts could be affected by many factors, including: \n• prolonged lower commodity prices; • a decrease in demand for our services in the markets we serve; • increased competition for our services in the markets we serve; and • actions by FERC or other regulatory bodies that impact our rates or costs. \nIf we replace expiring agreements with short-term or spot transportation or storage services, our revenues could be more volatile than they would be under long-term arrangements.   If we are unable to replace expiring agreements or renew the expiring agreements on comparable terms, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. \nWe are exposed to the credit risks, and certain other risks, of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could reduce our ability to make distributions to our unitholders. \nWe are subject to the risks of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers. If any of our most significant customers default on their obligations to us, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our customers may be highly leveraged and subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. If any of our customers were to seek protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or other insolvency laws, the court could void the customer’s contracts with us or allow our customer to reject such contracts. Similarly, if, due to effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for any other reason, any of our customers or other counterparties were to seek to assert any force majeure or similar provision in its contract with us or other contractual defenses to performance available to them, including the doctrine of impossibility, im practicability of performance, frustration of performance and others, a court could excuse some or all of such customer’s or counterparty’s performance under its contract with us. For certain of our pipelines, we may have a limited pool of potential customers and may be unable to replace any customers who default on their obligations to us. Therefore, any material deterioration in the credit worthiness of our customers or any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders. \nIn addition, we are subject to political and economic risks that impact our customers. For example, the U.S. has gradually expanded sanctions that have impacted Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PdVSA”) and its subsidiaries as well as the Government of Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, the Trump Administration designated PdVSA on the Specifically Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”). As a result, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with PdVSA and its majority- owned subsidiaries. Certain of our customers are subsidiaries of PdVSA and, as a result, we and certain of our customers may be impacted if the General Licenses allowing for the temporary continuation of operations or engagements with PdVSA and its majority-owned subsidiaries expire in the future. Therefore, absent further action by the U.S. government and OFAC, the loss of customers as a result of the sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders.

The board of directors of our general partner is chosen by the member of our general partner, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of SPLC. Furthermore, if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they will have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which our common units will trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price. \nEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they cannot remove our general partner without its consent. \nUnitholders will be unable to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient units to be able to prevent its removal. The vote of the holders of at least  $66\\;2/3\\%$   of all outstanding common units is required to remove our general partner. \nOur Partnership Agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders’ ability to influence the manner or direction of management. \nOur general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent. \nOur Partnership Agreement does not restrict the ability of SPLC to transfer all or a portion of its general partner interest or its ownership interest in our general partner to a third party. Our general partner, or the new owner of our general partner, would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions made by the board of directors and officers. \nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute unitholder interests. \nAt any time, we may issue an unlimited number of limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our unitholders, and our unitholders will have no preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as unitholders) to purchase any such limited partner interests. Further, there are no limitations in our Partnership Agreement on our ability to issue equity securities that rank equal or senior to our common units as to distributions or in liquidation or that have special voting rights and other rights. The issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects: \n• our existing unitholders’ proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease; • the amount of cash we have available to distribute on each unit may decrease; • the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase; • the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and • the market price of our common units may decline. \nSPLC may sell units in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units. \nAs of December 31, 2020, SPLC held 269,457,304 common units. Additionally, we have agreed to provide SPLC with certain registration rights under applicable securities laws. The sale of these units in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop. "}

{"page": 55, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_SHLX_2020_55.jpg", "ocr_text": "Similarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the\nrelative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand\ndynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product\ntransportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics, including the continuing effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. Demand can also be greatly affected by refinery performance in the end market, as refined products pipeline demand will increase to\nfill the supply gap created by refinery issues.\n\nWe can also be constrained by asset integrity considerations in the volumes we ship. We may elect to reduce cycling on our systems to reduce asset\nintegrity risk, which in turn would likely result in lower revenues.\n\nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers\nand consumers and to create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. For example, production from Shell’s Appomattox\nplatform in the Gulf of Mexico, which came online during 2019, tied into our existing Proteus and Endymion systems to bring crude onshore. Similarly, we\nexpect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to\nonshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of\nthe Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully\noperational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022. We believe this strategy will allow our offshore business to grow\nprofitably throughout demand cycles.\n\nChanges in Customer Contracting\n\nWe generate a portion of our revenue under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease\ntransportation agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and storage service agreements with marketers, pipelines and refiners. Historically,\nthe commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements have substantially mitigated volatility in our financial results by\nlimiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to\nrenew or replace our contract portfolio on comparable terms, by sustained downturns or sluggishness in commodity prices, or the economy in general (as\nwith the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on the demand for oil and gas), and is impacted by shifts in supply and\ndemand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our\noperations. Our business can also be impacted by asset integrity or customer interruptions and natural disasters or other events that could lead customers to\ninvoke force majeure or other defenses to avoid contractual performance.\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2019, Zydeco recontracted previously expired volumes under certain of its throughput and deficiency agreements (“T&D\nagreements”). Although we replaced the volumes, the rates under the new T&D agreements were lower than those previously contracted. Two of these\nT&D agreements expired in the fourth quarter of 2020, and have not been replaced. The T&D agreements that expired accounted for less than 10% of our\nrevenue for 2020. There are several ways in which this revenue could be replaced in the future, such as through re-contracting or spot shipments, the\noutcome of which will be dependent on market and customer dynamics.\n\nThe market environment at any given time will dictate the rates, terms and duration of agreements that shippers are willing to enter into, as well as the\ncontracts that best satisfy the needs of our business. As we have grown and diversified our business over the past several years, and as recently as the\nsecond quarter of 2020 with the April 2020 Transaction, we have benefited from shifting reliance away from the results of any one asset. While Zydeco\ncontinues to serve an important market, and we strive to maximize the long-term value of the system to both shippers and the pipeline, we will continue to\ndiversify our risk across products, customers and geographies.\n\nChanges in Commodity Prices and Customers’ Volumes\n\nCrude oil prices have fluctuated significantly over the past few years, often with drastic moves in relatively short periods of time. During 2020, the demand\nfor, and price of, oil and natural gas decreased significantly due to the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting governmental\nregulations and travel restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. The current global geopolitical and economic uncertainty continues to contribute\nto future volatility in financial and commodity markets. Our direct exposure to commodity price fluctuations is limited to the PLA provisions in our tariffs.\nIndirectly, global demand for refined products and chemicals could impact our terminal operations and refined products and refinery gas pipelines, as well\nas our crude pipelines that feed U.S. manufacturing demand. Likewise, changes in the global market for crude oil could affect our crude oil pipeline and\nterminals and require expansion capital expenditures to reach\n\n56\n", "vlm_text": "Similarly, our refined products pipelines have the ability to serve multiple major demand centers. Our refined products shippers periodically change the relative mix of refined products shipped on our refined products pipelines, as well as the destination points, based on changes in pricing and demand dynamics. While these changes in shipping patterns are reflected in relative types of refined products handled by our various pipelines, our total product transportation revenue is primarily affected by changes in overall refined products supply and demand dynamics, including the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand can also be greatly affected by refinery performance in the end market, as refined products pipeline demand will increase to fill the supply gap created by refinery issues. \nWe can also be constrained by asset integrity considerations in the volumes we ship. We may elect to reduce cycling on our systems to reduce asset integrity risk, which in turn would likely result in lower revenues. \nAs these supply and demand dynamics shift, we anticipate that we will continue to actively pursue projects that link new sources of supply to producers and consumers and to create new services or capacity arrangements that meet customer requirements. For example, production from Shell’s Appomattox platform in the Gulf of Mexico, which came online during 2019, tied into our existing Proteus and Endymion systems to bring crude onshore. Similarly, we expect to continue extending our corridor pipelines to provide developing growth regions in the Gulf of Mexico with access via our existing corridors to onshore refining centers and market hubs. By way of example, in the latter part of 2019 we announced a solicitation of interest for a potential expansion of the Mars system to address growing production volumes in the Gulf of Mexico regions served by Mars. It is expected that the project would be fully operational with incremental growth volumes arriving into the Mars system in 2022. We believe this strategy will allow our offshore business to grow profitably throughout demand cycles. \nChanges in Customer Contracting \nWe generate a portion of our revenue under long-term transportation service agreements with shippers, including ship-or-pay agreements and life-of-lease transportation agreements, some of which provide a guaranteed return, and storage service agreements with marketers, pipelines and refiners. Historically, the commercial terms of these long-term transportation and storage service agreements have substantially mitigated volatility in our financial results by limiting our direct exposure to reductions in volumes due to supply or demand variability. Our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to renew or replace our contract portfolio on comparable terms, by sustained downturns or sluggishness in commodity prices, or the economy in general (as with the continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impacts on the demand for oil and gas), and is impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics, the mix of services requested by the customers of our pipelines, competition and changes in regulatory requirements affecting our operations.

FERC contemporaneously issued the Order on Rehearing in Docket No. PL17-1-000, which affirms\nFERC’s position in the Revised Policy Statement that eliminated the recovery of an income tax allowance by MLP oil and gas pipelines in cost-of-service-\nbased rates. In Order No. 849, however, FERC has clarified its general disallowance of MLP income tax allowance recovery by providing that an MLP will\nnot be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance. FERC will permit an MLP to demonstrate that\nits recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a “double recovery of investors’ income tax costs.” FERC affirmed Order No. 849 on rehearing\non April 18, 2019. Parties sought judicial review of the Revised Policy Statement, and that challenge, initially filed in March 2019, was denied by the U.S.\nCourt of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 14, 2020. No further petitions are outstanding on this matter.\n\nAs was the case with the Revised Policy Statement, FERC did not propose any industry-wide action regarding review of rates for crude oil and liquids\npipelines in its July 2018 issuances. MLP owned crude oil and liquids pipelines are required to report Page 700 information in their FERC Form 6 annual\nreports. Both the elimination of the income tax allowance, as well as the corporate income tax reduction enacted as part of the TCJA, were considered by\nFERC in the order on the five-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the\nincome tax allowance elimination in setting the new indexing adjustment. FERC will also implement the elimination of the income tax allowance in\nproceedings involving review of initial cost-of-service rates, rate changes and rate complaints. For crude oil and liquids pipelines owned by non-MLP\npartnerships and other pass-through businesses, FERC will address such issues as they arise in subsequent proceedings.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, FERC issued a NOI as Docket No. RM20-14-000 regarding the five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index formula. FERC proposed a\nnew formula of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (“PPI-FG”) plus 0.09% based on its review of industry data provided in the annual FERC Form 6\nreports from 2014 through 2019. The NOI proposal, which would take effect in July 2021, would change the current five-year formula from PPI-FG plus\n1.23%. FERC invited comments regarding its proposal and any alternative methodologies for calculating the index level, including issues such as different\ndata trimming methodologies and whether it should reflect the effects of any cost-of-service policy changes in the calculation of the index level. Comments\non the NOI were filed by multiple parties by August 17, 2020, and reply comments were filed by September 11, 2020. After reviewing the comments and\nreply comments by interested parties, FERC issued an order on December 17, 2020 adopting a new formula of PPI-FG plus 0.78% for the next five-year\nperiod commencing on July 1, 2021. This order is subject to rehearing and possible judicial review.\n\nWe believe that the recent issuances from FERC, including the Revised Policy Statement and issuances in July 2018, will not have a material impact on our\noperations and financial performance. Since FERC only maintains jurisdiction over interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the recent decisions are not\nexpected to have an impact on rates charged through our offshore operations. FERC also does not maintain jurisdiction over certain of the onshore assets in\nwhich we have interests. Rates related to these assets should not be impacted by FERC’s decision. For our FERC-regulated rates charged through our\ninterstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the rates are based on either a negotiated or market-based rate and are not set through cost-of-service ratemaking\nsubject to FERC’s approval, which are below the cost-of-service rates established by FERC. As such, neither our negotiated nor market-based rate revenue\nfor our FERC-regulated assets would be subject to the income tax recovery disallowance. Additionally, we have evaluated the impact of FERC’s recent\npolicy changes on our non-operated joint ventures. Due to the nature of their assets, operations and/or their entity form, we do not believe there will be any\nmaterial impact to their operations and earnings.\n\nOn October 20, 2016, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket No. RM17-1-000 (the “ANOPR”) regarding changes to the oil\npipeline rate index methodology and data reporting on Page 700 of FERC’s Form No. 6. On February 21, 2020, FERC withdrew the ANOPR and denied\nadditional shipper requests seeking changes to Page 700 reporting requirements as the ANOPR’s proposed changes were not consistent with FERC’s\nsimplified and streamlined indexing regime. No further updates are expected on this matter.\n\nOn October 1, 2019, PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement\nauthority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice\nor opportunity for a hearing.

In Order No. 849, however, FERC has clarified its general disallowance of MLP income tax allowance recovery by providing that an MLP will not be precluded in a future proceeding from making a claim that it is entitled to an income tax allowance. FERC will permit an MLP to demonstrate that its recovery of an income tax allowance does not result in a “double recovery of investors’ income tax costs.” FERC affirmed Order No. 849 on rehearing on April 18, 2019. Parties sought judicial review of the Revised Policy Statement, and that challenge, initially filed in March 2019, was denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on August 14, 2020. No further petitions are outstanding on this matter. \nAs was the case with the Revised Policy Statement, FERC did not propose any industry-wide action regarding review of rates for crude oil and liquids pipelines in its July 2018 issuances. MLP owned crude oil and liquids pipelines are required to report Page 700 information in their FERC Form 6 annual reports. Both the elimination of the income tax allowance, as well as the corporate income tax reduction enacted as part of the TCJA, were considered by FERC in the order on the five-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the income tax allowance elimination in setting the new indexing adjustment. FERC will also implement the elimination of the income tax allowance in proceedings involving review of initial cost-of-service rates, rate changes and rate complaints. For crude oil and liquids pipelines owned by non-MLP partnerships and other pass-through businesses, FERC will address such issues as they arise in subsequent proceedings. \nOn June 18, 2020, FERC issued a NOI as Docket No. RM20-14-000 regarding the five-year review of the oil pipeline rate index formula. FERC proposed a new formula of Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (“PPI-FG”) plus   $0.09\\%$   based on its review of industry data provided in the annual FERC Form 6 reports from 2014 through 2019. The NOI proposal, which would take effect in July 2021, would change the current five-year formula from PPI-FG plus  $1.23\\%$  . FERC invited comments regarding its proposal and any alternative methodologies for calculating the index level, including issues such as different data trimming methodologies and whether it should reflect the effects of any cost-of-service policy changes in the calculation of the index level. Comments on the NOI were filed by multiple parties by August 17, 2020, and reply comments were filed by September 11, 2020. After reviewing the comments and reply comments by interested parties, FERC issued an order on December 17, 2020 adopting a new formula of PPI-FG plus  $0.78\\%$   for the next five-year period commencing on July 1, 2021. This order is subject to rehearing and possible judicial review. \nWe believe that the recent issuances from FERC, including the Revised Policy Statement and issuances in July 2018, will not have a material impact on our operations and financial performance. Since FERC only maintains jurisdiction over interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the recent decisions are not expected to have an impact on rates charged through our offshore operations. FERC also does not maintain jurisdiction over certain of the onshore assets in which we have interests. Rates related to these assets should not be impacted by FERC’s decision. For our FERC-regulated rates charged through our interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the rates are based on either a negotiated or market-based rate and are not set through cost-of-service ratemaking subject to FERC’s approval, which are below the cost-of-service rates established by FERC. As such, neither our negotiated nor market-based rate revenue for our FERC-regulated assets would be subject to the income tax recovery disallowance. Additionally, we have evaluated the impact of FERC’s recent policy changes on our non-operated joint ventures. Due to the nature of their assets, operations and/or their entity form, we do not believe there will be any material impact to their operations and earnings. \nOn October 20, 2016, FERC issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in Docket No. RM17-1-000 (the “ANOPR”) regarding changes to the oil pipeline rate index methodology and data reporting on Page 700 of FERC’s Form No. 6. On February 21, 2020, FERC withdrew the ANOPR and denied additional shipper requests seeking changes to Page 700 reporting requirements as the ANOPR’s proposed changes were not consistent with FERC’s simplified and streamlined indexing regime. No further updates are expected on this matter. \nOn October 1, 2019, PHMSA issued three new final rules. One rule establishes procedures to implement the expanded emergency order enforcement authority set forth in an October 2016 interim final rule. Among other things, this rule allows PHMSA to issue an emergency order without advance notice or opportunity for a hearing. The other two rules impose several new requirements on operators of onshore gas transmission systems and hazardous liquids pipelines. The rule concerning gas transmission extends the requirement to conduct integrity assessments beyond HCAs to pipelines in Moderate Consequence "}

The rule concerning hazardous liquids\nextends the required use of leak detection systems beyond HCAs to all regulated non-gathering hazardous liquid pipelines, requires reporting for gravity\nfed lines and unregulated gathering lines, requires periodic inspection of all lines not in HCAs, calls for inspections of lines after extreme weather events\nand adds a requirement to make all onshore lines in or affecting HCAs capable of accommodating in-line inspection tools over the next 20 years. There are\nnew MCAs on some of our gas transmission lines; however, these lines are already fully inspected due to HCAs on the lines, so these new areas do not\nimpact inspection or maintenance programs on the lines.

We also may pursue acquisitions jointly with Shell. Given\nthe size and scope of Shell’s footprint and its significant ownership interest in us, we expect acquisitions from Shell will be a growth mechanism for the\nforeseeable future.

However, if we do not make\nacquisitions on economically acceptable terms or if we incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the acquisitions, our future growth will be\nlimited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash. Our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may\nalso directly impact our ability to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions. The level of current market demand for equity issued by MLPs may make it\nmore challenging for us to fund our acquisitions with the issuance of equity in the capital markets.

These decreases were partially\noffset by new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020.\n\nTerminaling services revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the service components of the new terminaling service\nagreement related to the Norco Assets acquired in April 2020.\n\nLease revenue was relatively consistent in 2020 and 2019.\nProduct revenue decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil for certain of our onshore and offshore crude pipelines in 2020 as compared to 2019.\n\nCosts and Expenses\n\nTotal costs and expenses increased $24 million in 2020 primarily due to the increases of $38 million in operations and maintenance expenses, $3 million in\nproperty taxes and $1 million of depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $12 million in cost of products sold, $4 million\nin general and administrative expenses and $2 million of loss from the revision of asset retirement obligations and disposition of assets incurred in 2019.\n\nOperations and maintenance expenses increased mainly as a result of higher maintenance costs related to the Norco Assets\nin 2020 as compared to 2019.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased primarily due to reduced contractor spend in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by higher severance\ncharges in 2020.\n\nProperty tax expense increased as a result of the acquisition of the Norco Assets in April 2020 and was partially offset by\nchanges in property tax appraisal estimates.\n\nCost of product sold decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil coupled with the lower cost environment in 2020 as compared to 2019, which was\npartially offset by a higher net realizable value adjustment on allowance oil inventory in 2020.\n\nInvestment, Dividend and Other Income\n\nInvestment, dividend and other income increased $34 million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Income from equity method investments increased by $44\nmillion, primarily as a result of the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as\nthe acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of $14\nmillion due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following\nthe acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019.

A discussion of changes in our Results of Operations and Capital Resources and Liquidity  —  Cash Flows from Our Operations from 2018 to 2019 has been omitted from the Form 10-K, but may be found in  Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020. \n2020 Compared to 2019 \nRevenues \nTotal revenue decreased by  $\\mathbb{S}22$   million in 2020 as compared to 2019, comprised of decreases of  $\\S53$   million in transportation services revenue,  $\\mathbb{S}12$   million in allowance oil revenue and  $\\mathbb{S}21$   million attributable to product revenue, partially offset by increases of \\$63 million attributable to terminaling services revenue and \\$1 million in lease revenue. \nTransportation services revenue decreased primarily due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the crude and refined products operating environment and related prices in 2020, as well as lower rates on the Zydeco committed contracts in 2020 as compared to 2019. Additionally, the impact from planned turnaround activities, as well as the impact of storms and the related shut-ins of production, was higher in 2020 than 2019. Further, deficiency credits were primarily deferred in 2020 as compared to deficiency credits being utilized and recognized in revenue in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by new volumes brought online at NaKika and Odyssey, as well as achieving regulatory approval for an increase in tariffs on Delta in 2020. \nTerminaling services revenue increased primarily due to the recognition of revenue related to the service components of the new terminaling service agreement related to the Norco Assets acquired in April 2020. \nLease revenue was relatively consistent in 2020 and 2019. \nProduct revenue decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil for certain of our onshore and offshore crude pipelines in 2020 as compared to 2019. \nCosts and Expenses \nTotal costs and expenses increased  $\\S24$   million in 2020 primarily due to the increases of  $\\S38$   million in operations and maintenance expenses, \\$3 million in property taxes and   $\\S1$   million of depreciation expense. These increases were partially offset by decreases of  $\\mathbb{S}12$   million in cost of products sold, \\$4 million in general and administrative expenses and  $\\S2$   million of loss from the revision of asset retirement obligations and disposition of assets incurred in 2019. \nOperations and maintenance expenses increased mainly as a result of higher maintenance costs related to the Norco Assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. \nGeneral and administrative expense decreased primarily due to reduced contractor spend in 2020 compared to 2019, partially offset by higher severance charges in 2020. \nProperty tax expense increased as a result of the acquisition of the Norco Assets in April 2020 and was partially offset by changes in property tax appraisal estimates. \nCost of product sold decreased as a result of lower sales of allowance oil coupled with the lower cost environment in 2020 as compared to 2019, which was partially offset by a higher net realizable value adjustment on allowance oil inventory in 2020. \nInvestment, Dividend and Other Income \nInvestment, dividend and other income increased  $\\S34$   million in 2020 as compared to 2019. Income from equity method investments increased by  $\\S44$  million, primarily as a result of the equity earnings associated with the acquisition of additional interests in Explorer and Colonial in June 2019, as well as the acquisition of an interest in Mattox in April 2020. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in dividend income from other investments of  $\\mathbb{S}14$  million due to the change in accounting for Explorer and Colonial as equity method investments in 2020 rather than other investments in 2019 following the acquisition of additional interests in these entities in June 2019. We were entitled to distributions from Explorer and Colonial with respect to the period beginning April 1, 2019, as these were paid after the acquisition date and were no longer considered dividend income.

The agreements will continue to be in effect until the continued operation of\nthe platform is uneconomic.\n\nOn December 1, 2014, we entered into a terminal services agreement with a related party in which we were to take possession of certain storage tanks\nlocated in Port Neches, Texas, effective December 1, 2015. On October 26, 2015, the terminal services agreement was amended to provide for an interim\nin-service period for the purposes of commissioning the tanks in which we paid a nominal monthly fee. Our capitalized costs and related capital lease\nobligation commenced effective December 1, 2015, and the storage tanks were placed in-service on September 1, 2016. Under this agreement, in the\neighteenth month after the in-service date, actual fixed and variable costs could be compared to premised costs. If the actual and premised operating costs\ndiffer by more than 5%, the lease would be adjusted accordingly, and this adjustment will be effective for the remainder of the lease. No adjustment has\nbeen made to date. The imputed interest rate on the capital portion of the lease is 15%.\n\nOn September 1, 2016, which is the in-service date of the capital lease for the Port Neches storage tanks, a joint tariff agreement with a third party became\neffective. The tariff will be reviewed annually and the rate updated based on FERC’s indexing adjustment to rates effective July 1 of each year. Effective\nJuly 1, 2020 there was an approximate 2% increase to this rate based on FERC’s indexing adjustment. The initial term of the agreement is ten years with\nautomatic one-year renewal terms with the option to cancel prior to each renewal period.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nWe have not entered into any transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements that would result in off-balance sheet liabilities.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nCritical accounting policies are those that are important to our financial condition and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions.\n\nWe apply those accounting policies that we believe best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with GAAP. Our more critical\naccounting policies include those related to long-lived assets, equity method investments and revenue recognition. Inherent in such policies are certain key\nassumptions and estimates. We periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the\ncurrent and projected business and general economic environment. Our significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 — Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 8 of this report. We believe the following to be our most\ncritical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements.\n\nLong-Lived Assets\n\nKey estimates related to long-lived assets include useful lives, recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations. Such estimates\ncould be significantly modified. The carrying values of long-lived assets could be impaired by significant changes or projected changes in supply and\ndemand fundamentals of oil, natural gas, refinery gas or refined products (which could have a negative impact on operating rates or margins), new\ntechnological developments, new competitors, adverse changes associated with the U.S. and global economies and with governmental actions. We evaluate\nlong-lived assets for potential impairment indicators whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nrecoverable, including when negative conditions such as significant current or projected operating losses exist. Our judgments regarding the existence of\nimpairment indicators are based on legal factors, market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses. Actual impairment losses incurred\ncould vary significantly from amounts estimated. Long-lived assets assessed for impairment are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash\nflows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Additionally, future events could cause us to conclude that impairment\nindicators exist and that associated long-lived assets of our businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on\nour financial condition and results of operations.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of long-lived assets range from five to 40 years. Depreciation of these assets under the straight-line method over their estimated\nuseful lives totaled $50 million, $49 million and $46 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. If the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter\nthan originally estimated, depreciation charges would be accelerated.

Income\nfrom equity method investments represents our proportionate share of net income generated by the equity method investees. Differences in the basis of the\ninvestments and the separate net asset value of the investees, if any, are amortized into net income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying\n\nassets. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred, if the\nloss is deemed to be other-than-temporary. When the loss is deemed to be other-than-temporary, the carrying value of the equity method investment is\nwritten down to fair value.\n\nBased on our updated forecast and expectations of market conditions, we determined that there was a triggering event as of December 7, 2020 for our\nPermian Basin equity method investment that required us to update our impairment evaluation. The updated forecast had reductions in forecasted volumes\ngathered and processed by Permian Basin. We utilized the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value appraisal of our\ninvestment in Permian Basin. Based on our evaluation, we determined that the fair value of our investment in Permian Basin was in excess of the carrying\nvalue as of December 7, 2020, and, therefore, there was no other-than-temporary impairment.\n\nThe fair value of the Permian Basin investment was determined based upon applying both the discounted cash flow method, which is an income approach,\nand a market approach. The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known and knowable information at the measurement date. The significant\nassumptions that were used to develop the estimate of fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management's best estimates of the\nexpected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. If the discount rate was\nincreased by 1%, the concluded fair value would decrease by $5 million and would remain in excess of carrying value. If the long-term growth rate was\ndecreased by 1%, the concluded fair value would decrease by $4 million and would remain in excess of carrying value. Fair value determinations require\nconsiderable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts\nwill not vary significantly from estimated amounts.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related Accounting Standard Updates to this Topic\n(collectively, “the revenue standard”). See Note 12 — Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of\nthis report for additional information.\n\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the\ncontract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance\nobligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations. We generate a portion of our revenue under long-term\nagreements by charging fees for the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil and refined products, intermediate and finished products through\nour pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks, and for the transportation of refinery gas through our assets. Contract obligations are billed\nmonthly. Transportation revenue is billed as services are rendered, and we accrue revenue based on nominations for that accounting month. We estimate\nthis revenue based on contract data, regulatory information and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements, among other items. Additionally, we\nrefer to our transportation services agreements and throughput and deficiency agreements as “ship-or-pay” contracts.\n\nAs a result of FERC regulations, revenues we collect may be subject to refund. We establish reserves for these potential refunds based on actual expected\nrefund amounts on the specific facts and circumstances. We had no reserves for potential refunds as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nThe majority of our long-term transportation agreements and tariffs for crude oil transportation include PLA. PLA is an allowance for volume losses due to\nmeasurement differences set forth in crude oil transportation agreements. PLA is intended to assure proper measurement of the crude oil despite solids,\nwater, evaporation and variable crude types that can cause mismeasurement. PLA provides additional revenue for us if product losses on our pipelines are\nwithin the allowed levels, and we are required to compensate our customers for any product losses that exceed the allowed levels. We take title to any\nexcess loss allowance when product losses are within the allowed levels, and we sell that product several times per year at prevailing market prices.\n\nCertain transportation and terminaling services agreements with related parties are considered operating leases under GAAP.

The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among\nentities under common control on a prospective basis as an asset acquisition. As a part of the Norco Transaction, SOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred\ncertain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex to Triton, as designee of the Partnership. The transfer of the Norco Assets combined with\nthe terminaling service agreements was accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard, as control of the assets did not transfer to the\nPartnership. As a result, the transaction was treated as financing arrangement.\n\nWe also recorded contract assets as of April 1, 2020 based on the difference between the consideration allocated to the Norco Transaction and the\nrecognized financing receivables. The contract assets represent the excess of the fair value embedded within the terminaling services agreements\ntransferred by the Partnership to SOPUS and Shell Chemical as part of entering into the terminaling services agreements. The amount of contract assets\nrecognized was dependent on the allocated fair value of the consideration to the Norco Transaction, which was determined using the fair values of the\nconsideration transferred and the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction. The common units were valued using a market\napproach based on the market opening price of the Partnership’s common units as of April 1, 2020 less a discount for the distribution waiver and lack of\nmarketability. The Series A Preferred Units were valued using an income approach based on a trinomial lattice model.

We do not intend to enter into any hedging agreements to\nmitigate our exposure to decreases in commodity prices through our loss allowances.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to the risk of changes in interest rates, primarily as a result of variable rate borrowings under our revolving credit facilities.

The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the contract assets’\nvalue to underlying assumptions used to fair value the components of the April 2020 Transaction.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries where we have control.

Regulatory bodies exercise statutory authority over\nmatters such as construction, rates and ratemaking and agreements with customers.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts\nreported of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\n\nCommon Control Transactions\n\nAssets and businesses acquired from our Parent and its subsidiaries are accounted for as common control transactions whereby the net assets acquired are\ncombined with ours at our Parent’s historical carrying value. If any recognized consideration transferred in such a transaction exceeds the carrying value of\nthe net assets acquired, the excess is treated as a capital distribution to our general partner, similar to a dividend. If the carrying value of the net assets\nacquired exceeds any recognized consideration transferred including, if applicable, the fair value of any limited partner units issued, then our Parent would\nrecord an impairment, and our net assets acquired would be recorded at fair value. Cash consideration up to the carrying value of net assets acquired is\npresented as an investing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Cash consideration in excess of the carrying value of net assets acquired is\npresented as a financing activity in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Assets and businesses sold to our Parent are also common control transactions\naccounted for using historical carrying value with any resulting gain treated as a contribution from Parent.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nOur revenues are primarily generated from the transportation, terminaling and storage of crude oil, refined gas and refined petroleum products through our\npipelines, terminals, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks. We recognize revenue when we transfer promised goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. We recognize revenue through the\napplication of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the\ntransaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance\nobligations. See Note 12 — Revenue Recognition for information and disclosures related to revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nLeases, Sale Leaseback\n\nWhen entering into sale-leaseback transactions as a buyer-lessor, the requirements in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 606, Revenue\nfrom Contracts with Customers, and all related accounting standards updates to such Topic (collectively, “the revenue standard”) are applied in determining\nwhether the transfer of an asset shall be accounted for as a sale of the asset by assessing whether it satisfies a performance obligation under the contract by\ntransferring control of an asset. If the seller-lessee transfers control of an asset to us, we account for the transfer of the asset as a purchase and recognize the\ntransferred asset. The subsequent leaseback of the asset is accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 842, Leases (the “lease standard”), in the same\nmanner as any other lease. If the seller-lessee does not transfer the control of an asset to us, the failed sale-leaseback transaction is accounted for as a\nfinancing arrangement. Transactions in which control of an asset is not transferred are accounted for as financing receivables in accordance with ASC\nTopic 310, Receivables. Since the seller-lessee did not transfer the control of assets to us in the April 2020 Transaction (defined in Note 3 — Acquisitions\nand Other Transactions below), we did not recognize the transferred assets, and instead they were accounted for as financing receivables.

We\nestablish provisions for losses on third-party accounts receivable due from shippers and operators based on current expected credit losses. As of\n\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not have a material amount of allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\nEquity Method Investments\n\nWe account for investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, under the equity method of accounting.

Differences in the basis of the\ninvestments and the underlying net asset value of the investees, if any, are amortized into net income over the remaining useful lives of the underlying\nassets.

These events include a significant decrease in the market value of the asset,\nchanges in the manner in which we intend to use a long-lived asset, decisions to sell an asset and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such\nas adverse actions by regulators. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we perform an impairment assessment by comparing\nestimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset to the asset’s net book value. If the net book value exceeds our estimate of undiscounted\nfuture cash flows, an impairment is calculated as the amount the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value associated with the asset. We determined\nthat there were no asset impairments in 2020, 2019 or 2018.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax.

These events include a significant decrease in the market value of the asset, changes in the manner in which we intend to use a long-lived asset, decisions to sell an asset and adverse changes in the legal or business environment such as adverse actions by regulators. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we perform an impairment assessment by comparing estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset to the asset’s net book value. If the net book value exceeds our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment is calculated as the amount the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value associated with the asset. We determined that there were no asset impairments in 2020, 2019 or 2018.   \nIncome Taxes \nWe are not a taxable entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes or for the majority of states that impose an income tax. Taxes on our net income are generally borne by our partners through the allocation of taxable income. Our income tax expense results from partnership activity in the state of Texas, as conducted by Zydeco, Sand Dollar and Triton. Income tax expense for 2020, 2019 and 2018 was immaterial. \nOther Investments \nWe account for equity investments in entities where we do not have control or significant influence at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income when the fair value is readily determinable. For investments without readily determinable fair values, we carry such investments at cost less impairments, if any. These investments are remeasured either upon the "}

Our general partner or its assignee has also agreed to waive a portion of the distributions that would otherwise be payable on the common units issued to SPLC as part of the April 2020 Transaction, in an amount of  $\\mathbb{S}20$   million per quarter for each of four consecutive fiscal quarters, beginning with the distribution made with respect to the second quarter of 2020. \nAs consideration for the April 2020 Transaction, the Partnership issued 50,782,904 Series A Preferred Units to SPLC at a price of  $\\S23.63\\$   per unit, plus 160,000,000 newly issued common units.

See more discussion in\nthe section entitled “Norco Transaction” below.\n\nMattox Transaction\n\nWe acquired 79% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox from SGOM. The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among\nentities under common control on a prospective basis as an asset acquisition. As a result of the Mattox Transaction, we have significant influence, but not\ncontrol, over Mattox and account for this investment as an equity method investment. As such, we recorded the acquired equity interests in Mattox at\nSGOM’s historical carrying value of $174 million, which is included in Equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,\n2020. See Note 5 —Equity Method Investments for additional details.\n\nNorco Transaction\n\nSOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex located in Norco, Louisiana, which are\ncomprised of crude, chemicals, intermediate and finished product pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and supporting infrastructure, to\nTriton, as a designee of the Partnership. The Partnership simultaneously leased the Norco Assets back to SOPUS and Shell Chemical pursuant to the\nterminaling services agreements entered into among Triton, SOPUS and Shell Chemical related to the Norco Assets. The Partnership receives an annual net\npayment of $140 million, which is the total annual payment pursuant to the terminaling services agreements of $151 million, less $11 million, which\nprimarily represents the allocated utility costs from SOPUS related to the Norco Assets. Both payments are subject to annual Consumer Price Index\nadjustments.\n\nThe transfer of the Norco Assets combined with the terminaling services agreements were accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard,\nas control of the assets did not transfer to the Partnership. As a result, the transaction was treated as a financing arrangement. As the Norco Transaction was\nentered into simultaneously and in contemplation of the Mattox Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components, we allocated $546 million of the\nfair value of the consideration of the April 2020 Transaction to the Norco Transaction based on its relative stand-alone fair value to the other components of\nthe April 2020 Transaction. From this amount, we recorded financing receivables of $302 million, based on the fair value of the Norco Assets’ property,\nplant and equipment transferred from SOPUS and Shell Chemical, using a combination of market and cost valuation approaches. The financing receivables\nwere recorded as the fair value of property, plant and equipment because the annual payments received by the Partnership are directly related to the lease of\nthe property, plant and equipment of the Norco Assets. Since the financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical arose from transactions involving\nthe issuance of the Partnership’s common and preferred units, the financing receivables are presented as a component of (deficit) equity and not as assets on\nthe balance sheet.\n\nAs of April 1, 2020, we also recorded contract assets in the amount of $244 million, which represent the difference between the allocated fair value of the\nNorco Transaction of $546 million and the recognized financing receivables of $302 million. The contract assets represent the excess of the fair value\nembedded within the terminaling services agreements transferred by the Partnership to SOPUS and Shell Chemical as part of entering into the terminaling\nservices agreements. See Note 12 — Revenue Recognition for additional details.\n\nThe amount of contract assets recognized was dependent on the allocated fair value of the consideration to the Norco Transaction, which was determined\nusing the fair values of the consideration transferred and the fair values of each of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction. The newly issued\ncommon units were valued using a market approach based on the market opening price of the Partnership’s common units as of April 1, 2020, less a\ndiscount for the waiver described above and a marketability discount. The Series A Preferred Units were valued using an income approach based on a\ntrinomial lattice model. Further, the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction were determined using an income\n\n93\n", "vlm_text": "The image shows a table summarizing an April 2020 financial transaction with the following components:\n\n1.

See more discussion in the section entitled “Norco Transaction”  below. \nMattox Transaction \nWe acquired  $79\\%$   of the issued and outstanding membership interests in Mattox from SGOM. The acquisition was accounted for as a transaction among entities under common control on a prospective basis as an asset acquisition. As a result of the Mattox Transaction, we have significant influence, but not control, over Mattox and account for this investment as an equity method investment. As such, we recorded the acquired equity interests in Mattox at SGOM’s historical carrying value of \\$174 million, which is included in Equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. See  Note 5 —Equity Method Investments  for additional details. \nNorco Transaction \nSOPUS and Shell Chemical transferred certain logistics assets at the Shell Norco Manufacturing Complex located in Norco, Louisiana, which are comprised of crude, chemicals, intermediate and finished product pipelines, storage tanks, docks, truck and rail racks and supporting infrastructure, to Triton, as a designee of the Partnership. The Partnership simultaneously leased the Norco Assets back to SOPUS and Shell Chemical pursuant to the terminaling services agreements entered into among Triton, SOPUS and Shell Chemical related to the Norco Assets. The Partnership receives an annual net payment of \\$140 million, which is the total annual payment pursuant to the terminaling services agreements of   $\\S151$   million, less \\$11 million, which primarily represents the allocated utility costs from SOPUS related to the Norco Assets. Both payments are subject to annual Consumer Price Index adjustments. \nThe transfer of the Norco Assets combined with the terminaling services agreements were accounted for as a failed sale leaseback under the lease standard , as control of the assets did not transfer to the Partnership. As a result, the transaction was treated as a financing arrangement. As the Norco Transaction was entered into simultaneously and in contemplation of the Mattox Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components, we allocated \\$546 million of the fair value of the consideration of the April 2020 Transaction to the Norco Transaction based on its relative stand-alone fair value to the other components of the April 2020 Transaction. From this amount, we recorded financing receivables of  $\\S302$   million, based on the fair value of the Norco Assets’ property, plant and equipment transferred from SOPUS and Shell Chemical, using a combination of market and cost valuation approaches. The financing receivables were recorded as the fair value of property, plant and equipment because the annual payments received by the Partnership are directly related to the lease of the property, plant and equipment of the Norco Assets. Since the financing receivables from SOPUS and Shell Chemical arose from transactions involving the issuance of the Partnership’s common and preferred units, the financing receivables are presented as a component of (deficit) equity and not as assets on the balance sheet. \nAs of April 1, 2020, we also recorded contract assets in the amount of  $\\S244$   million, which represent the difference between the allocated fair value of the Norco Transaction of  $\\S546$   million and the recognized financing receivables of  $\\S302$   million. The contract assets represent the excess of the fair value embedded within the terminaling services agreements transferred by the Partnership to SOPUS and Shell Chemical as part of entering into the terminaling services agreements. See  Note  $^{l2}$   — Revenue Recognition  for additional details. \nThe amount of contract assets recognized was dependent on the allocated fair value of the consideration to the Norco Transaction, which was determined using the fair values of the consideration transferred and the fair values of each of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction. The newly issued common units were valued using a market approach based on the market opening price of the Partnership’s common units as of April 1, 2020, less a discount for the waiver described above and a marketability discount. The Series A Preferred Units were valued using an income approach based on a trinomial lattice model. Further, the fair values of the three components of the April 2020 Transaction were determined using an income "}

The June 2019 Acquisition increased our ownership interest in Explorer to 38.59% and in Colonial to\n16.125%.

In addition, as a transfer between entities under common control, we recorded Accumulated other comprehensive loss of $6\nmillion related to historical remeasurements of pension and other postretirement benefits provided by Explorer and Colonial to their employees.

(“STCW”) and non-cash\nequity consideration valued at $200 million. Pursuant to the May 2019 Contribution Agreement, the number of common units representing the equity\nconsideration was determined by dividing the contribution amount (25% of total consideration of $800 million) by the price per unit of $20.68, which\nrepresents the volume weighted average sales prices of the common units calculated for the five trading day period ended on April 30, 2019, less the\ngeneral partner units issued to our general partner in order to maintain its 2% general partner interest in us. The equity issued consisted of\n\n9,477,756 common units issued to LP Holdings, an indirect subsidiary of Shell, and 193,424 general partner units issued to our general partner in order to\nmaintain its 2% general partner interest in us. These common and general partner units issued were assigned no book value because the cash consideration\nexceeded the historical carrying value of equity interests acquired. Accordingly, the units issued had no impact on partner capital accounts, other than\nchanging ownership percentages.\n\nAs a result of the June 2019 Acquisition, we now have significant influence over both Explorer and Colonial and account for these investments as equity\nmethod investments (see Note 5 — Equity Method Investments for further details).\n\n2018 Acquisition\n\nOn May 11, 2018, we acquired SPLC’s ownership interests in Amberjack, which is comprised of 75% of the issued and outstanding Series A membership\ninterests of Amberjack and 50% of the issued and outstanding Series B membership interests of Amberjack, for $1,220 million (the “May 2018\nAcquisition”). The May 2018 Acquisition closed pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement dated May 9, 2018 between us and SPLC, and is accounted\nfor as a transaction between entities under common control on a prospective basis as an asset acquisition. We acquired historical carrying value of net\nassets under common control of $482 million, which is included in Equity method investments in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognized $738\nmillion of consideration in excess of the historical carrying value of net assets acquired as a capital distribution to our general partner in accordance with\nour policy for common control transactions. We funded the May 2018 Acquisition with $494 million in borrowings under our Five Year Revolver due July\n2023 (as defined in Note 8 — Related Party Debt) and $726 million in borrowings under our Five Year Revolver due December 2022 (as defined in Note 8\n— Related Party Debt) with STCW.\n\n94\n", "vlm_text": "approach of discounted cash flows at an average discount rate for each of the Mattox Transaction, the Norco Transaction and the GP/IDR Restructuring components of   $14\\%$  ,   $11\\%$   and  $20\\%$  , respectively. \nGP/IDR Restructuring \nOn April 1, 2020, we also closed the transactions contemplated by the Partnership Interests Restructuring Agreement, which included the elimination of all the IDRs and the cancellation of all of the general partner units, both of which were held by our general partner, and amended and restated our partnership agreement to reflect these and other changes (as so amended, the “Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement”).

The Amberjack adjustment\nis related to its dedication and transportation agreements, which contain tiered pricing arrangements resulting in a deferral of revenue. The Mars adjustment\nrelated to its transportation and dedication agreement and method of recognition as a stand-ready obligation, which resulted in a deferral of the recognition\n\nof revenue over the life of the contract, whereas under previous GAAP revenue was recognized upon physical delivery.

As a result of\nthe Settlement Agreement, we received approximately $9 million during the fourth quarter of 2019 from SPLC that was recognized as an additional capital\n\ncontribution.

We are generally not made aware of the interest rate implicit in a lease due to several reasons, including: (1) uncertainty as to the total amount of the costs incurred by the lessor in negotiating the lease or whether certain costs incurred by the lessor would qualify as initial direct costs and (2) uncertainty as to the lessor’s expectation of the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease. Therefore, we use our IBR at the commencement of the lease and estimate the IBR for each lease agreement taking into consideration lease contract term, collateral and entity credit ratings, and use sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reasonableness of the rates determined. \nLease balances and costs \nThe following tables summarize balance sheet data related to leases at December 31, 2020 and 2019 and our lease costs as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 : \nThe table provides financial information regarding leases for the years ending December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. It is divided into two sections: Assets and Liabilities, with further subdivisions within each.\n\n**Assets:**\n1. **Operating Lease Assets:**\n   - Operating lease right-of-use assets: $4 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n\n2. **Finance Lease Assets:**\n   - Property, plant, and equipment, net: $16 million in 2020 and $17 million in 2019.\n\n3. **Total Lease Assets:**\n   - $20 million for 2020 and $21 million for 2019.\n\n**Liabilities:**\n1. **Current Liabilities (Finance):**\n   - Accrued liabilities - third parties: $1 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n\n2. **Noncurrent Liabilities:**\n   - Operating lease liabilities: $4 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n   - Finance lease liabilities: $24 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n\n3. **Total Lease Liabilities:**\n   - $29 million for both 2020 and 2019.\n\nThis table compares lease-related financial figures between two consecutive years, reflecting balance sheet figures under asset and liability categories for specific types of leases."}

In the event of any liquidation of the Partnership, the Series A Preferred Units are entitled to receive, out of the assets of the Partnership available for distribution to the partners or any assignees, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of any junior securities, the value in each holder ’ s capital account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units. \nChange of Control \nUpon the occurrence of certain events involving a change of control in which more than  $90\\%$   of the consideration payable to the holders of the common units is payable in cash, the Series A Preferred Units will automatically convert into common units at the then-applicable conversion rate. Upon the occurrence of certain other events involving a change of control, the holders of the Series A Preferred Units may elect, among other potential elections, to convert the Series A Preferred Units to common units at the then-applicable conversion rate. \nSpecial Distribution \nEach Series A Preferred Unit has the right to share in any special distributions by the Partnership of cash, securities or other property pro rata with the common units or any other securities, on an as-converted basis, provided that special distributions shall not include regular quarterly distributions paid in the normal course of business on the common units. \nDistributions to our Unitholders \nIn connection with the April 2020 Transaction, commencing with the quarter ending June 30, 2020, the holders of the Series A Preferred Units are entitled to cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of  $\\S0.2363$   per Series A Preferred Unit, payable quarterly in arrears no later than 60 days after the end of the applicable quarter.

This\ncapacity cannot be pro-rated even if the pipeline is oversubscribed. In exchange, the customer makes a specified monthly payment regardless of the volume\ntransported. If the customer does not ship its full guaranteed volume in a given month, it makes the full monthly cash payment (i.e., deficiency payments)\nand it may ship the unused volume in a later month for no additional cash payment for up to 12 months, subject to availability on the pipeline. The cash\npayment received is recognized as deferred revenue, a contract liability under the revenue standard. If there is insufficient capacity on the pipeline to allow\nthe unused volume to be shipped, the customer forfeits its right to ship such unused volume. We do not refund any cash payments relating to unused\nvolumes.\n\nUnder the revenue standard, we are required to estimate the likelihood that unused volumes will be shipped or forfeited at each reporting period based on\nadditional data that becomes available and only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur. In some cases, this\nestimate could result in the earlier recognition of revenue.\n\nWe also recognize deferred revenue on the major maintenance service components of the terminaling service agreement related to Norco Assets when we\ninvoice SOPUS and Shell Chemical for the minimum volume commitment. Please refer to the Terminaling services revenues - Norco Assets section above\nfor additional revenue recognition discussion.\n\nReimbursements from customers\n\nUnder certain transportation, terminaling and storage service contracts, we receive reimbursements from customers to recover costs of construction,\nmaintenance or operating costs either under a tariff surcharge per volume shipped or under separate reimbursement payments. Because we consider these\namounts as consideration from customers associated with ongoing services to be provided to customers, we defer these payments in deferred revenue and\nrecognize amounts in revenue over the life of the associated revenue contract as performance obligations are satisfied under the contract. We consider these\npayments to be revenue because control of the long-lived assets does not transfer to our customer upon completion.

Pursuant to the terms of the 2019 Omnibus Agreement, we pay a fixed administrative fee to SPLC, which covers, among other things, the services provided to us by our NEOs. None of Mr. Nichols, Mr. Carsten, Ms. Muratta, Ms. Stanley or Mr. Ledbetter receive, nor did Mr. Smith receive, any separate amounts of compensation for their services to our business or as executive officers of our general partner and, except for the fixed administrative fee we paid SPLC, we did not otherwise pay or reimburse any compensation amounts to or for them.  \nSummary Compensation Table \nThe following summarizes the total compensation paid to our NEOs for their services in relation to our business in 2020, 2019 and 2018:  "}

With respect to other similar events, including, for example, a combination or exchange of units, a merger or consolidation or an extraordinary distribution of our assets to unitholders, that would not result in an accounting charge if adjustment to awards were discretionary, the administrator of the LTIP has the discretion to adjust awards in the manner it deems appropriate and to make equitable adjustments, if any, with respect to the number and kind of units subject to outstanding awards, the terms and conditions of any outstanding awards and the grant or exercise price per unit for outstanding awards under the LTIP. Furthermore, in connection with a change in control of us or our general partner, or a change in any law or regulation affecting the LTIP or outstanding awards or any relevant change in accounting principles, the administrator of the LTIP will generally have discretion to (i) accelerate the time of exercisability or vesting or payment of an award, (ii) permit awards to be surrendered in exchange for a cash payment, (iii) cause awards then outstanding to be assumed or substituted for other rights by the surviving entity in the change in control, (iv) provide for either (A) the termination of any award in exchange for a payment of the amount that would have been received upon the exercise of such award or realization of the grantee’s rights under such award or (B) the replacement of an award with other rights or property selected by the administrator having an aggregate value not exceeding the amount that could have been received upon the exercise of such award or realization of the grantee’s rights had such award been currently exercisable or payable or fully vested, (v) provide that an award be assumed by the successor or survivor entity, or be exchanged for similar options, rights or awards covering the equity of the successor or survivor, with appropriate adjustments thereto, (vi) make adjustments in the number and type of units subject to outstanding awards, the number and kind of outstanding awards, the terms and conditions of, and/or the vesting and performance criteria included in, outstanding awards, (vii) provide that an award will vest or become exercisable or payable and/or (viii) provide that an award cannot be exercised or become payable after such event and will terminate upon such event. \nTermination of Employment \nThe LTIP provides the administrator with the discretion to determine in each award agreement the effect of a termination of a grantee’s employment, membership on our general partner’s Board or other service arrangement on the grantee’s outstanding awards. \nAmendment or Termination of LTIP \nThe administrator of the LTIP, at its discretion, may terminate the LTIP at any time with respect to the common units for which a grant has not previously been made. The LTIP automatically terminates on the tenth anniversary of the date it was initially adopted by our general partner. The administrator of the LTIP also has the right to alter or amend the LTIP or any part of it from time to time or to amend any outstanding award made under the LTIP, provided that no change in any outstanding award may be made that would materially impair the vested rights of the participant without the consent of the affected participant or result in taxation to the participant under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

Each transferee, with or without executing our partnership agreement: •    agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of our partnership agreement; \n•    represents and warrants that the transferee has the right, power, authority and capacity to enter into our partnership agreement; and •    gives the consents, waivers and approvals contained in our partnership agreement, such as the approval of all transactions and agreements that we entered into in connection with our formation and that we enter into in connection with an offering pursuant to a prospectus. \nWe are entitled to treat the nominee holder of a common unit as the absolute owner in the event such nominee is the record holder of such common unit. In such case, the beneficial holder’s rights are limited solely to those that it has against the nominee holder as a result of any agreement between the beneficial owner and the nominee holder. \nOur common units are securities and are transferable according to the laws governing the transfer of securities. Until a common unit has been transferred on our register, we and the transfer agent are entitled to treat the record holder of the common unit as the absolute owner, except as otherwise required by law or stock exchange regulations. \nA unitholder who sells any of his or her units is generally required to notify us in writing of that sale within 30 days after the sale (or, if earlier, January 15 of the year following the sale). A purchaser of units who purchases units from another unitholder is also generally required to notify us in writing of that purchase within 30 days after the purchase. Upon receiving such notifications, we are required to notify the U.S. Internal Revenue Service of that transaction and to furnish specified information to the transferor and transferee. Failure to notify us of a purchase may, in some cases, lead to the imposition of penalties. However, these reporting requirements do not apply to a sale by an individual who is a citizen of the United States and who effects the sale or exchange through a broker who will satisfy such requirements. \nChange of Management Provisions \nOur partnership agreement contains specific provisions that are intended to discourage a person or group from attempting to remove Shell Midstream Partners GP LLC as our general partner or otherwise change our management. If any person or group other than our general partner and its affiliates acquires beneficial ownership of  $20\\%$   or more of any class of units, that person or group loses voting rights on all of its units. This loss of voting rights does not apply to any person or group that acquires the units from our general partner or its affiliates and any transferees of that person or group who are notified by our general partner that they will not lose their voting rights or to any person or group who acquires the units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner or the Series A preferred unitholders with respect to their ownership (beneficial or record) of the Series A preferred units or common units issued upon conversion of Series A preferred units. \nOur partnership agreement also provides that if our general partner is removed as our general partner under circumstances where cause does not exist and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal, our general partner will have the right to convert its general partner units into common units or to receive cash in exchange for those interests based on the fair market value of those interests as of the effective date of its removal.

We were\ncontractually obligated to make capital improvements to the asset as part of the terms of an operating agreement with LOOP. The costs associated with the\nBrine String Project have been deferred and are being amortized over 10 years. Amortization expense of $755,376 was recorded for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, and is included in Depreciation and amortization in the accompanying statements of income.\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n\nAsset retirement obligations (“AROs”) represent contractual or regulatory obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from\nacquisition, construction, development and/or normal use of the asset. We record liabilities for obligations related to the retirement and removal of long-\nlived assets used in our businesses at fair value on a discounted basis when they are incurred and can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for the\nrelated assets are increased by the amount of these obligations. Over time, the liabilities increase due to the change in their present value and the initial\ncapitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. The liabilities are eventually extinguished when settled at the time the asset is\ntaken out of service.\n\nWe continue to evaluate our AROs and future developments could impact the amounts we record. The demand for our pipelines depends on the ongoing\ndemand to move crude oil through the system. Although individual assets will be replaced as needed, we expect our pipelines will continue to exist for an\nindeterminate economic life. As such, there is uncertainty around the timing of any asset retirement activities. As a result, we determined that there is not\nsufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of the AROs for our assets and we have not recognized any AROs for the year ended December 31,\n2020 and 2019.\n\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\n\nLong lived assets of identifiable business activities are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in our management’s\njudgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. These events include market declines that are believed to be other-than-temporary,\nchanges in the manner in which we intend to use a long-lived asset, decisions to sell an asset and adverse changes in the legal or business environment,\nsuch as adverse actions by regulators. If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying\nvalues based on the long-lived asset’s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we\ncompare our management’s estimate of forecasted undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine\nwhether the assets are recoverable (i.e., the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the net carrying value of the assets). If the assets are not recoverable, we\ndetermine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount\nthat the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. We determined that there were no asset impairments in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019\nand 2018.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAssets and liabilities requiring fair value presentation or disclosure are measured using an exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or\npaid to transfer a liability) and are disclosed according to the quality of valuation inputs under the following hierarchy:\n\nLevel | - Quoted prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or liability is classified based on the lowest level of input significant to its measurement. A fair value initially reported as Level 3\nwill be subsequently reported as Level 2 if the unobservable inputs become inconsequential to its measurement or corroborating market data becomes\navailable. Asset and liability fair values initially reported as Level 2 will be subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborating market data becomes\nunavailable.\n\nThe carrying amounts of our Accounts receivable, net, Other current assets, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Payables to related parties\napproximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature.\n\nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks\nA significant portion of our revenues and receivables are from related parties and other oil and gas companies. Although collection of these receivables\ncould be influenced by economic factors affecting the oil and gas industry, management believes the risk of significant loss to be remote.\n\nThe following table shows revenues from third and related parties that accounted for 10% or more of Total revenue in the accompanying statements of\nincome for the indicated periods:\n", "vlm_text": "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nOther Assets \nDuring 2015, we paid   $\\mathbb{S7}{,}553{,}757$   to LOOP for replacing a Brine pipeline (also known as the “Brine String Project”) owned by LOOP.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value of assets or liabilities. \nThe fair value of an asset or liability is classified based on the lowest level of input significant to its measurement. A fair value initially reported as Level 3 will be subsequently reported as Level 2 if the unobservable inputs become inconsequential to its measurement or corroborating market data becomes available. Asset and liability fair values initially reported as Level 2 will be subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborating market data becomes unavailable. \nThe carrying amounts of our Accounts receivable, net, Other current assets, Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Payables to related parties approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. \nConcentration of Credit and Other Risks \nA significant portion of our revenues and receivables are from related parties and other oil and gas companies.

Revenue Recognition\n\nThe core principle of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and all related ASUs to this Topic (collectively, the “revenue standard”) is that a\ncompany will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the\ncompany expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revenue standard requires entities to recognize revenue through the application\nof a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the performance obligations; determination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of revenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nOur revenues are primarily generated from the transportation and storage of crude oil through our pipelines and storage facilities. To identify the\nperformance obligations, we considered all the products or services promised in the contracts with customers, whether explicitly stated or implied based on\ncustomary business practices. Revenue is recognized when each performance obligation is satisfied under the terms of the contract. Each barrel of product\ntransported or day of services provided is considered a distinct service that represents a performance obligation that would be satisfied over time if it were\naccounted for separately. The services provided over the contract period are a series of distinct services that are substantially the same, have the same\npattern of transfer to the customer, and therefore, qualify as a single performance obligation. Since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the\nbenefits of services, we recognize revenue over time based on a measure of progress of volumes transported for transportation services contracts, number of\ndays elapsed for stand ready-transportation service contracts or number of days elapsed for storage services contracts.\n\nProduct revenue related to allowance oil sales is recognized at the point in time when the control of the oil transfers to the customer.\nFor all performance obligations, payment is typically due in full within 30 days of the invoice date.\n\nDisaggregation of Revenue — The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by service type and customer type:\n\n14\n", "vlm_text": "NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n\nThe table provides information related to operating leases as of December 31, 2020.

Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our net income in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. For both December 31, 2020 and 2019, these costs and any related liabilities are not material. \n9.

If an event occurs, which is a determination that involves judgment, we evaluate the recoverability of our carrying\nvalues based on the long-lived asset’s ability to generate future cash flows on an undiscounted basis. When an indicator of impairment has occurred, we\ncompare our management’s estimate of forecasted undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets to the carrying value of the assets to determine\nwhether the assets are recoverable (i.e., the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the net carrying value of the assets). If the assets are not recoverable, we\ndetermine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount\nthat the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. In October 2020 Chevron filed a notification of the cessation of production of the GC 205 platform\nto the United States Department of the Interior Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. As a result of this filing, a review of abandoning the\nSouth Corridor assets was performed.

Leases\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 842 “Leases”\n\nOn January 1, 2020, we adopted ASC Topic 842 (the “new lease standard’) by applying the modified retrospective approach to all leases on January 1,\n2020. Under this new guidance, lessees are required to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all\nleases. We elected the package of practical expedients upon transition that permits us to not reassess (1) whether any contracts entered into prior to adoption\nare or contain leases, (2) the lease classification of existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior to adoption.\n\nUpon adoption on January 1, 2020, we recognized operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and corresponding lease liabilities of $58,748,340.\n\nLessee accounting\n\nWe determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Our assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct\nidentified asset, (2) whether we obtain the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period and (3) whether we\nhave the right to direct the use of the asset. Leases are classified as either finance leases or operating leases. A lease is classified as a finance lease if any\none of the following criteria are met: the lease transfers ownership of the asset by the end of the lease term, the lease contains an option to purchase the\nasset that is reasonably certain to be exercised, the lease term is for a major part of the remaining useful life of the asset or the present value of the lease\npayments equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the asset. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these\ncriteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease costs are recorded entirely in operating expenses.\nFinance lease costs are split, where amortization of the ROU asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in\ninterest expense.\n\nUnder the new lease standard, operating leases (as lessee) are included in Operating lease right of use assets- related party, net, Operating lease right of use\nassets- third party, net, Current operating lease liabilities- related party, Current operating lease liabilities- third party, Noncurrent operating lease liabilities-\nrelated party, and Noncurrent operating lease liabilities- third party in our balance sheets. Finance leases (as lessee) are included in Finance lease right of\nuse assets- related party, Finance lease amortization of right of use assets- related party, Finance lease right of use assets- related party, net, Current finance\nlease liabilities- related party, and Noncurrent finance lease liabilities- related party in our balance sheets. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at\ncommencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit\ninterest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at transition date in determining the present value of future\npayments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made but excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Lease expense for\nminimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nLease extensions\n\nMany of our leases have options to either extend or terminate the lease. In determining the lease term, we considered all available contract extensions that\nare reasonably certain of occurring.\n\nSignificant assumptions and judgments\n\nIncremental borrowing rate. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) at the\ncommencement of the lease and estimate the IBR for each lease agreement taking into consideration lease contract term, collateral and entity credit ratings,\nand use sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reasonableness of the rates determined.\n\nLease balances and costs\n\nOperating leases\nWe have several LOPS agreements to lease usage of offshore platform spaces located at GC 19. The original LOPS agreement at platform GC 19\ncommenced on October 1, 1997 was amended on April 1, 2009 and on November 1, 2016 for the lease of\n\n12\n", "vlm_text": "Series A to share common costs including the main bypass piping, engineering, design and permitting.

A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not meet any one of these criteria. The lease classification affects the expense recognition in the income statement. Operating lease costs are recorded entirely in operating expenses. Finance lease costs are split, where amortization of the ROU asset is recorded in operating expenses and an implied interest component is recorded in interest expense. \nUnder the new lease standard, operating leases (as lessee) are included in Operating lease right of use assets- related party, net, Operating lease right of use assets- third party, net, Current operating lease liabilities- related party, Current operating lease liabilities- third party, Noncurrent operating lease liabilities- related party, and Noncurrent operating lease liabilities- third party in our balance sheets. Finance leases (as lessee) are included in Finance lease right of use assets- related party, Finance lease amortization of right of use assets- related party, Finance lease right of use assets- related party, net, Current finance lease liabilities- related party, and Noncurrent finance lease liabilities- related party in our balance sheets. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at transition date in determining the present value of future payments. The ROU asset includes any lease payments made but excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred, if any. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. \nLease extensions \nMany of our leases have options to either extend or terminate the lease. In determining the lease term, we considered all available contract extensions that are reasonably certain of occurring. \nSignificant assumptions and judgments \nIncremental borrowing rate.  As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”) at the commencement of the lease and estimate the IBR for each lease agreement taking into consideration lease contract term, collateral and entity credit ratings, and use sensitivity analyses to evaluate the reasonableness of the rates determined. \nLease balances and costs \nOperating leases \nWe have several LOPS agreements to lease usage of offshore platform spaces located at GC 19. The original LOPS agreement at platform GC 19 commenced on October 1, 1997 was amended on April 1, 2009 and on November 1, 2016 for the lease of "}

Revenue Recognition\n\nAdoption of Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nOn January 1, 2019, we adopted Topic 606 and all related ASUs to this Topic (collectively, the “new revenue standard”) by applying the modified\nretrospective method to all contracts that were not completed on January 1, 2019. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2019 are\npresented in accordance with the new revenue standard, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our\nhistoric accounting under previous U.S. GAAP.\n\nUpon the adoption of the new revenue standard, we recorded a non-cash cumulative effect transition adjustment to decrease the opening balance of\nMembers’ capital in the amount of $18,853,034, which related to a deferral of revenue related to cash collected from life of lease contracts in the early\nyears driven by tiered pricing terms or surcharges that relate to all of the performance obligations within the contracts.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nThe new revenue standard’s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an\namount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue standard\nrequires entities to recognize revenue through the application of a five-step model, which includes: identification of the contract; identification of the\nperformance obligations; determination of the transaction price; allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and recognition of\nrevenue as the entity satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nOur revenues are primarily generated from the transportation of crude oil through our pipelines. To identify the performance obligations, we considered all\nthe products or services promised in the contracts with customers, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices. Revenue is\nrecognized when each performance obligation is satisfied under the terms of the contract. Each barrel of product transported is considered a distinct service\nthat represents a performance obligation that would be satisfied over time if it were accounted for separately. The services provided over the contract period\nare a series of distinct services that are substantially the same, have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, and therefore, qualify as a single\nperformance obligation. Since the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of services, we recognize revenue over time based ona\nmeasure of progress of volumes transported for transportation services contracts.\n\nProduct revenue related to allowance oil sales is recognized at the point in time when the control of the oil transfers to the customer.\nFor all performance obligations, payment is typically due in full within 30 days of the invoice date.\n\nDisaggregation of Revenue — The following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by service type and customer type:\n\n15\n", "vlm_text": "Annual maturity analysis \nThe future annual maturity of lease payments as of December 31, 2020 for the above lease obligations was: \nThe table presents the maturity of lease liabilities for operating and finance leases from 2021 to the remainder (beyond 2025), along with totals for each category.\n\n- **Operating Leases:**\n  - Annual lease liabilities from 2021 to 2025 are $3,223,299 each year.\n  - Remainder (beyond 2025) is $46,843,529.\n  - Total lease payments amount to $62,960,024.\n  - Less: Interest of $23,109,779.\n  - Present value of lease liabilities is $39,850,245.\n\n- **Finance Leases:**\n  - Annual lease liabilities from 2021 to 2025 are $2,775,805 each year.\n  - Remainder (beyond 2025) is $42,331,027.\n  - Total lease payments amount to $56,210,052.\n  - Less: Interest of $17,727,519.\n  - Present value of lease liabilities is $38,482,533.\n\n- **Total:**\n  - Annual total lease liabilities from 2021 to 2025 are $5,999,104 each year.\n  - Remainder (beyond 2025) is $89,174,556.\n  - Total lease payments amount to $119,170,076.\n  - Less: Total interest of $40,837,298.\n  - Present value of total lease liabilities is $78,332,778.\n8.

For our long-term dedication and transportation contracts, customers dedicate production of the oil well\nfor the life of the dedicated leases. Transportation services are charged at a per barrel rate. We apply the allocation exception guidance for variable\nconsideration related to market indexing for long-term transportation contracts because (a) the variable payment relates specifically to our efforts to transfer\nthe distinct service and (b) we allocate the variable amount of consideration entirely to the distinct service which is consistent with the allocation objective.\nTransportation services are billed monthly as services are rendered and revenue is recognized over time using an output method measure of progress based\non each barrel transported.\n\nOur contracts and tariffs contain terms for the customer to reimburse us for losses from evaporation or other loss in transit in the form of allowance oil.\nAllowance oil represents the net difference between the tariff PLA volumes and the actual volumetric losses. We obtain control of the excess oil not lost\nduring transportation, if any. Under the revenue standard, we include the excess oil retained during the period, if any, as non-cash consideration and include\nthis amount in the transaction price for transportation services on a net basis. Our allowance oil is valued using the average market price of the relevant\ntype of crude oil during the month product was transported. Gains on pipeline operations that relate to allowance oil are recorded in Operations and\nmaintenance in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n\nCertain of our long-term dedication and transportation contracts contain tiered-pricing and/or surcharges imposed over a specific time period. For these\ncontracts, we estimate the total transaction price using production forecasts multiplied by the transportation rate; this approach takes into consideration any\ntiered pricing, and any applicable surcharge. In considering whether the variable consideration is constrained, we consider scenarios in which forecasted\nvolumes are significantly higher or lower during periods in which a surcharge or tiered price is in effect as well as scenarios in which the life of the\ndedicated leases is extended past its expected life.\n\nDeferred revenue — Prior to January 1, 2019, deferred revenue under our transportation services arrangements was recognized into revenue once all\ncontingencies or potential performance obligations associated with the related volumes had been satisfied or expired.

It distinguishes between revenue from third parties and related parties:\n\n- **2018:**\n  - Third parties: $146.9 million\n  - Related parties: $115.2 million\n  - Total transportation services revenue: $262.1 million\n  - Total revenue: $262.1 million\n\n- **2019:**\n  - Third parties: $162.5 million\n  - Related parties: $117.9 million\n  - Total transportation services revenue: $280.4 million\n  - Total revenue: $280.4 million\n\n- **2020:**\n  - Third parties: $103.3 million\n  - Related parties: $140.6 million\n  - Total transportation services revenue: $243.9 million\n  - Total revenue: $243.9 million\nTransportation services revenue   –  We have both long-term dedication and transportation contracts and month-to-month transportation contracts for spot shippers that make nominations on our pipelines. For our long-term dedication and transportation contracts, customers dedicate production of the oil well for the life of the dedicated leases. Transportation services are charged at a per barrel rate. We apply the allocation exception guidance for variable consideration related to market indexing for long-term transportation contracts because (a) the variable payment relates specifically to our efforts to transfer the distinct service and (b) we allocate the variable amount of consideration entirely to the distinct service which is consistent with the allocation objective. Transportation services are billed monthly as services are rendered and revenue is recognized over time using an output method measure of progress based on each barrel transported. \nOur contracts and tariffs contain terms for the customer to reimburse us for losses from evaporation or other loss in transit in the form of allowance oil. Allowance oil represents the net difference between the tariff PLA volumes and the actual volumetric losses. We obtain control of the excess oil not lost during transportation, if any. Under the revenue standard, we include the excess oil retained during the period, if any, as non-cash consideration and include this amount in the transaction price for transportation services on a net basis. Our allowance oil is valued using the average market price of the relevant type of crude oil during the month product was transported. Gains on pipeline operations that relate to allowance oil are recorded in Operations and maintenance in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. \nCertain of our long-term dedication and transportation contracts contain tiered-pricing and/or surcharges imposed over a specific time period. For these contracts, we estimate the total transaction price using production forecasts multiplied by the transportation rate; this approach takes into consideration any tiered pricing, and any applicable surcharge. In considering whether the variable consideration is constrained, we consider scenarios in which forecasted volumes are significantly higher or lower during periods in which a surcharge or tiered price is in effect as well as scenarios in which the life of the dedicated leases is extended past its expected life. \nDeferred revenue  – Prior to January 1, 2019, deferred revenue under our transportation services arrangements was recognized into revenue once all contingencies or potential performance obligations associated with the related volumes had been satisfied or expired. After January 1, 2019, under certain contracts with tiered pricing arrangements, we are entitled to receive payments in advance of satisfying our performance obligations under the contracts. We recognize a liability for these payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as deferred revenue on our balance sheets. "}

Environmental Matters \nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that could impact our assets or operations. These reviews assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts. In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us and potential third-party liability claims. Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs. These revisions are reflected in our net income in the period in which they are probable and reasonably estimable. For both December 31, 2020 and 2019, these costs and any related liabilities are not material. \n11. Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various laws and regulations. In the opinion of management, we are in compliance with existing laws and regulations and are not aware of any violations that could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are subject to several lease agreements, which are accounted for as operating leases and the minimum lease payments over the next five years are disclosed in  Note 7 – Leases . \n12. Subsequent Events \nIn preparing the accompanying financial statements, we have reviewed events that have occurred subsequent to December 31, 2020 through February 18, 2021, which is the date of the issuance of these financial statements.
