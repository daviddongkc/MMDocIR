The Constitution of the Islamic Republic recognizes Islam, Judaism,  and Christianity, as well as Zoroastrianism, and encourages participation of their  members in politics and society to the extent that this participation is not considered  threatening to the Islamic Republic. The constitution and major laws emphasize the  dominance of Islam and Muslims in all spheres of public life. Under Iranian law,  converting from Islam is considered apostasy and can result in severe punishments,  including the death penalty. Religious minorities possess certain codified rights, but the  legislators have prohibited non-Muslims from being guardians of Muslim children,  non-Muslim men from marrying Muslim women, and non-Muslims from inheriting  from Muslims. Non-Muslims also do not receive the same forms of redress for certain  harms as Muslims receive. Members of religious minorities cannot receive equal  retribution for some crimes or take senior governmental, military, or high public  managerial positions. Established rights of constitutionally recognized religious  minorities are reserved and protected to a significantly higher degree than those of  members of unrecognized minorities, which include those who convert from Islam or  speak against the Islamic Republic’s interpretations of Islam.

While Iranian law regards constitutionally recognized non-Muslims as  persons who are protected under international treaties that Iran has signed and ratified, and  under other domestic laws 2 —mainly article 13 of the constitution—Islamic jurisprudence as  interpreted by Iranian Islamic jurists considers non-Muslims, including constitutionally  recognized non-Muslims, as unbelievers in Islam ( kafir ). Therefore, Iranian law, in numerous  places, has considered what it has vaguely presumed as “superiority” in religious faith as a  ground for validating important civil rights—for example, testimony 3 —and it has clearly and  openly discriminated on the basis of religion in such matters as inheritance, financial retribution,  and blood money ( diya ).  Generally, when the law is silent or vague, there is room for judges and  jurists to make determinations according to their understanding of the law and Islamic criteria.   Article 20 of the constitution guarantees equality before the law, but qualifies that this equality is  subject to “conformity with Islamic criteria,” which has led to discrimination against certain  groups in the application of the law.

Before 2003, constitutionally recognized non-Muslims were openly awarded lower  diya  amounts than Muslims in accordance with the implied language of the law and Islamic  interpretations of it, though the exact fraction of this difference varied due to diverse  interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence. In 2003, an amendment was introduced to the then- existing article 297 of the penal code, explicitly providing for equality between constitutionally  recognized non-Muslims and Muslims with regard to  diya .  In 2013, a revised version of the penal  code (currently in force), added a separate new article 554, replacing the 2003 amendment and  unequivocally mandating equal  diya  amounts for both Muslims and constitutionally recognized  non-Muslims.
