Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have  imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable  packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain  packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include taxes to incentivize behavior, restrictions  on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of  single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility policies and requirements to charge deposit fees. For  example, the European Union has imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottles  packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in several states in the United States. These laws  and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand  for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our  independent bottlers, to increase our capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or  other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely  affect our business and financial performance.
