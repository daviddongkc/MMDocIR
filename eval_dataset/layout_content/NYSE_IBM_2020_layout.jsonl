The “Management  Discussion Snapshot” presents an overview of the key performance drivers in 2020. \n\n •   Beginning with the “Year in Review,” the Management Discussion contains the results of operations for each reportable segment  of the business and a discussion of our financial position and cash flows. Other key sections within the Management Discussion  include: “Looking Forward” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” which includes a description of management’s definition and  use of free cash flow. \n\n •   The Consolidated Financial Statements provide an overview of income and cash flow performance and financial position. \n\n •   The Notes follow the Consolidated Financial Statements. Among other items, the Notes contain our accounting policies, revenue  information, acquisitions and divestitures, certain commitments and contingencies and retirement-related plans information. \n\n •   On October 8, 2020, we announced our plan to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of our Global Technology  Services (GTS) segment into a new public company (currently referred to as NewCo and to be named later). The separation is  expected to be achieved through a U.S. federal tax-free spin-off to IBM shareholders and completed by the end of 2021. It will be  subject to customary market, regulatory and other closing conditions, including final IBM Board of Directors’ approval. The  announcement did not have any classification impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements or segment reporting. We will  report the managed infrastructure services unit as discontinued operations after its separation. \n\n •   In the first quarter of 2020, we realigned offerings and the related management system to reflect divestitures completed in the  second half of 2019 and tighter integration of certain industry-specific consulting services. These changes impacted Cloud &  Cognitive Software and Global Business Services (GBS) but did not impact the Consolidated Financial Statements. Total recast  revenue for full-year 2019 and 2018 was approximately  $\\S0.3$   billion and   $\\S0.4$   billion, respectively. The periods presented in this  Annual Report are reported on a comparable basis. \n\n •   On July 9, 2019, IBM acquired 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Red Hat, Inc. (Red Hat). Red Hat is reported within the  Cloud & Cognitive Software segment, in Cloud & Data Platforms. Refer to note E, “Acquisitions & Divestitures,” for additional  information. \n\n •   The references to “adjusted for currency” or “at constant currency” in the Management Discussion do not include operational  impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust  such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in  foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of business performance. Financial results  adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year  period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency.  Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or  adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. See “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for  additional information. \n\n •   To provide better transparency on the recurring performance of the ongoing business, the company provides total revenue,  geographic revenue and cloud revenue growth rates excluding divested businesses and at constant currency. These divested  businesses are included in the category “Other—divested businesses.”  ", "page_idx": 18, "bbox": [76, 119.00517272949219, 496, 525.0303955078125], "page_size": [585.3599853515625, 738.0]}

For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings  exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development,  transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre- closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to  period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired  companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings.

Identifiable intangible assets  with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives. Amortization of completed technology is recorded in cost, and amortization of all  other intangible assets is recorded in SG&A expense. Acquisition-related costs, including advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and  pre-close and other costs, are typically expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred and are recorded in SG&A expense. The  results of operations of acquired businesses are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date.

Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, privacy and  data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company or its clients could become subject to actions or proceedings in various  jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various  jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions,  country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with  respect to contracts, product liability, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may  be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and  regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to  which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the  laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.

Cash flows from the company’s expected benefit obligation payments are matched to the yield\ncurve to derive the discount rates.\n\nIn other non-U.S. countries where the markets for high-quality long-term bonds are not as well developed, a\nportfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a base, and a credit spread is added to simulate corporate\nbond yields at these maturities in the jurisdiction of each plan. This is the benchmark for developing the\nrespective discount rates.\n\nRepresents the expected long-term returns on plan assets based on the calculated market-related value of\nplan assets and considers long-term expectations for future returns and the investment policies and strategies\ndiscussed on pages 134 to 135. These rates of return are developed and tested for reasonableness against\nhistorical returns by the company.\n\nThe use of expected returns may result in pension income that is greater or less than the actual return of those\nplan assets ina given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate\nthe actual long-term returns, and therefore result in a pattern of income or loss recognition that more closely\nmatches the pattern of the services provided by the employees.\n\nThe difference between actual and expected returns is recognized as a component of net loss or gain in AOCI,\nwhich is amortized as a component of net periodic (income)/cost over the service lives or life expectancy of the\nplan participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed certain thresholds provided by\naccounting standards. The market-related value of plan assets recognizes changes in the fair value of plan\nassets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic\n(income)/cost.\n\nThe projected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2021 is 3.75 percent for U.S. and 2.86 percent for\nnon-U.S. DB Plans.\n\nCompensation rate increases are determined based on the company’s long-term plans for such increases.\nThese rate increases are not applicable to the U.S. DB pension plans as benefit accruals ceased December 31,\n2007.\n\nMortality assumptions are based on life expectancy and death rates for different types of participants and are\nperiodically updated based on actual experience.\n\nBenefits for certain participants in the PPP are calculated using a cash balance formula. An assumption\nunderlying this formula is an interest crediting rate, which impacts both net periodic (income)/cost and the\nPBO. This provides the basis for projecting the expected interest rate that plan participants will earn on the\nbenefits that they are expected to receive in the following year and is based on the average from August to\nOctober of the one-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yield plus one percent.\n\nFor nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the company reviews external data and its own historical trends\nfor healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. The healthcare cost trend rate has an\ninsignificant effect on plan costs or the benefit obligation due to the terms of the plan which limit the\ncompany’s obligation to the participants.\n\nThe company’s U.S. healthcare cost trend rate assumption for 2021 is 6.25 percent. The company assumes\nthat trend rate will decrease to 5.0 percent over the next six years.\n", "vlm_text": "The table provides a detailed description of various financial assumptions pertaining to a company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans. It is organized into five main items, each with a corresponding description explaining their significance and basis for calculation:\n\n1. **Discount Rate**: This section discusses how changes in discount rate assumptions affect net periodic income or cost and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). It explains the use of high-quality corporate bonds for determining discount rates in the U.S. and other countries, while noting specific adjustments for countries with less developed bond markets.\n\n2. **Expected Long-Term Returns on Plan Assets**: This part describes the assumptions for expected long-term returns on plan assets, emphasizing their basis on historical returns and future expectations. It mentions the impact of the expected returns on net periodic (income)/cost and how deviations from actual returns are managed. Specific projected rates for 2021 are given for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.\n\n3. **Rate of Compensation Increases and Mortality Assumptions**: Here, the table outlines how compensation rate increases are determined based on long-term company plans and clarifies that these do not apply to U.S. DB pension plans post-2007. Mortality assumptions are periodically updated based on life expectancy and death rates.\n\n4. **Interest Crediting Rate**: This section details how benefits for certain plan participants are calculated using an interest crediting rate, affecting net periodic income/cost and PBO. It explains the basis for projecting expected interest rates using U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yields.\n\n5. **Healthcare Cost Trend Rate**: This part explains how the healthcare cost trend rate for nonpension postretirement benefits is decided, incorporating external data and historical trends. It specifies that a healthcare trend rate assumption has little impact on plan costs due to plan limitations. The projected U.S. healthcare cost trend rate for 2021 and expectations for its future decrease are provided.\n\nOverall, the table explains the financial assumptions underlying the company's handling of pension and postretirement benefits, including their impact and rationale."}
