The Court has set out  a two-part test to determine whether legislation imposes an unconstitutional burden on  this freedom. The second part of the test, which involves considering whether the  burden imposed on the freedom is “reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a  legitimate end” in a manner consistent with the maintenance of representative and  responsible government, has resulted in diverging approaches among the High Court  justices. One approach involves the application of a structured proportionality  analytical framework, using a “compatibility test” to evaluate whether the purpose of  the law and the means it adopts are “legitimate.” An alternative view is that the  standard of review should vary depending on the nature and extent of the burden, with  laws that do not pose a significant risk to representative government needing only to  be “rationally related” to the pursuit of a legitimate end. The law is unsettled and is  likely to be discussed further in future cases.   ", "page_idx": 3, "bbox": [71, 225.27349853515625, 542, 423.0032958984375], "page_size": [612.0, 792.0]}
