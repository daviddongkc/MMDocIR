For a further description of the research and devel- opment and approval processes for the products of our  Innovative Medicines Division, see the sections headed  “Research and development” and “Regulation” included  in the description of our Innovative Medicines Division  under “Item 4. Information on the Company—Item 4.B  Business overview—Innovative Medicines.” \nOur Sandoz Division has made, and expects to con- tinue to make, significant investments in the development  of biotechnology‑based, “biologic” medicines intended  for sale as bioequivalent or “biosimilar” versions of cur- rently marketed biotechnology products. While the  development of such products typically is significantly  less costly and complex than the development of the  equivalent originator medicines, it is nonetheless signifi- cantly more costly and complex than that for typical  small-molecule generic products. See also “Item 4. Infor- mation on the Company—Item 4.B Business overview— Sandoz—Development and registration” with regards to  the research and development efforts of our Sandoz Divi- sion. In addition, many countries do not yet have fully  developed legislative or regulatory pathways to facilitate  the development of biosimilars and permit their sale in a  manner in which they are readily substitutable alterna- tives to the originator product. Further delays or difficul- ties in the development or marketing of biosimilars could  put at risk the significant investments that Sandoz has  made, and will continue to make, in its Biopharmaceuti- cals business. Failure to successfully develop and mar- ket biosimilars could have a material adverse effect on  the success of the Sandoz Division and the Group as a  whole. For more information about the approval pro- cesses that must be followed to market Sandoz Division  products, see “Item 4. Information on the Company—Item  4.B Business overview—Sandoz—Regulation.” Further,  our research and development activities must be con- ducted in an ethical and compliant manner. Among other  things, we are concerned with patient safety (both pre-  and post-product approval), data privacy, Current Good  Clinical Practices (cGCP) requirements, data integrity,  the fair treatment of patients, and animal welfare. Should  we fail to properly manage such issues, we risk injury to  third parties, damage to our reputation, negative finan- cial consequences as a result of potential claims for dam- ages, sanctions and fines, and the potential that invest- ments in research and development activities could have  no benefit to the Group. Research to find new targets  for drug discovery and the therapeutic agents to treat  unmet medical needs is made more difficult during pan- demics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This is primar- ily due to safety-related restrictions on the ability of lab- oratory scientists to work in research laboratories, and  impacts our ability to collaborate with academic and  commercial research organizations facing similar chal- lenges and restrictions.

There continue to be uncertainties as to the rules  that apply to such communications and as to the inter- pretations that health authorities will apply in this con- text, and as a result, despite our efforts to comply with  applicable rules, there is a risk that our use of social  media and other digital engagement platforms may  cause us to be found in violation of applicable regula- tions.  \nIn addition, the market for our products is evolving  rapidly with frequent changes in scientific evidence, sig- nificant advances in availability and utilization of real- world evidence (RWE), and the acceleration in the adop- tion of virtual and social media and other digital  engagement platforms by customers, patients and other  stakeholders, which may allow us to (i) better understand  the appropriate utilization of our products through RWE,  (ii) engage and appropriately educate customers,  patients and other stakeholders about the benefits and  risks associated with our products, and (iii) increase the  efficiency of our engagement with customers. Failure to  effectively utilize these increasingly important channels  and sources of evidence can result in the inadequate  education of customers regarding the benefits and risks  of our products and the loss of market share. In addition,  there is risk of inappropriate utilization of this data and  these channels by our employees or vendors. \nOperational risks \nCybersecurity and IT systems \nRisk description  \nCybersecurity breaches and catastrophic loss of IT sys- tems \nContext and potential impact \nWe are heavily dependent on critical, complex and inter- dependent information technology (IT) systems, includ- ing internet‑based systems to support our business pro- cesses. We also have outsourced significant parts of our  IT infrastructure to third-party providers, and we cur- rently use these providers to perform business-critical  IT services for us. We are therefore vulnerable to cyber- security attacks and incidents on such networks and  systems, whether our own or those of the third-party  providers we contract, and we have experienced and  may in the future experience such cybersecurity threats  and attacks. Cybersecurity threats and attacks take  many forms, and the size, age and complexity of our IT  systems make them potentially vulnerable to external  and internal security threats; outages; malicious intru- sions and attacks; cybercrimes, including state-spon- sored cybercrimes; malware; misplaced or lost data; pro- gramming or human errors; or other similar events. In the  context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of such  threats and attacks has increased, as virtual and remote  working has become more widely used, and sensitive  data is accessed by employees working in less secure,  home-based environments. In addition, due to our reli- ance on third-party providers, we have experienced and  may in the future experience interruptions, delays or out- ages in IT service availability due to a variety of factors  outside of our control, including technical failures, natu- ral disasters, fraud, or security attacks experienced by  or caused by the third-party provider. Interruptions in the  service provided by these third parties could affect our  ability to perform critical tasks. "}

Such settle- ments may require us to pay significant sums of money  and to enter into corporate integrity or similar agree- ments, which are intended to regulate company behav- ior for extended periods.  \n\nFor information on significant legal matters pending  against us, see “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 20.  Provisions and other non‑current liabilities” and “Item 18.  Financial Statements—Note 28. Commitments and con- tingencies.” \nNew requirements may also be imposed on us as a  result of changing government and societal expectations  regarding the healthcare industry, and acceptable cor- porate behavior generally. For example, we are faced  with laws and regulations requiring changes in how we  do business, including with respect to disclosures con- cerning our interactions with healthcare professionals,  healthcare organizations and patient organizations.  These laws and regulations include requirements that  we disclose payments or other transfers of value made  to healthcare professionals and organizations, as well as  information relating to the costs and prices for our prod- ucts, which represent evolving standards of acceptable  corporate behavior. These requirements may incur sig- nificant costs, including substantial time and additional  resources, that are necessary to bring our interactions  with healthcare professionals and organizations into  compliance with these evolving standards. \nIn addition to legal and regulatory requirements, as a  company we aim to meet the evolving societal expecta- tions of the public and our investors regarding ethical  behavior and the increasing importance placed on ESG  matters. \nTo help us in our efforts to comply with the many  requirements that impact us, we have a significant global  ethics and compliance program in place, and we devote  substantial time and resources to efforts to ensure that  our business is conducted in a lawful and publicly accept- able manner. Despite our efforts, an actual or alleged  failure to comply with law or with heightened public  expectations could lead to substantial liabilities that may  not be covered by insurance, or to other significant  losses. \nData privacy \nRisk description \nNoncompliance with personal data protection laws and  regulations \nContext and potential impact \nWe operate in an environment that relies on the collec- tion, processing, analysis and interpretation of large sets  of patients’ and other individuals’ personal information,  including via social media and mobile technologies. Also,  the operation of our business requires data to flow freely  across borders of numerous countries in which there are  different, and potentially conflicting, frequently changing  data privacy laws in effect. For example, the EU General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which took effect in  May 2018; the California Consumer Privacy Act, which  took effect in January 2020; Brazil’s General Personal  Data Protection Law, which entered into force in Sep- tember 2020; and the Personal Information Protection  Law in China, which took effect in November 2021,  impose stringent requirements on how we and third par- ties with whom we contract collect, share, export or oth- erwise process personal information, and provide for sig- nificant penalties for noncompliance. Breaches of our  systems or those of our third-party contractors, or other  failures to protect the data we collect from misuse or  breach by third parties, could expose such personal  information to unauthorized persons.

Our current and long-term debt requires\nus to dedicate a portion of our cash flow to service inter-\nest and principal payments and, if interest rates rise, this\namount may increase. As a result, our existing debt may\nlimit our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expen-\nditures, to engage in transactions, or to meet other cap-\nital needs, or otherwise may place us at a competitive\ndisadvantage relative to competitors that have less debt.\nOur debt could also limit our flexibility to plan for and\nreact to changes in our business or industry, and increase\nour vulnerability to general adverse economic and indus-\ntry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a\ndownturn in our business or the economy. We may also\nhave difficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring\nnew debt on terms that we would consider to be com-\nmercially reasonable, if at all.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n\nRisk description\nGoodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant\nimpairment charges\n\nContext and potential impact\n\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and other\nintangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet,\nincluding, in particular, substantial goodwill and other\nintangible assets obtained through acquisitions, includ-\ning most recently through our acquisitions of The\nMedicines Company, Xiidra, Endocyte, Novartis Gene\nTherapies, AAA, and certain oncology products from\nGSK. As a result, we may incur significant impairment\ncharges in the future if the fair value of the intangible\nassets and the groupings of cash-generating units con-\ntaining goodwill would be less than their carrying value\non the Group’s consolidated balance sheet at any point\nin time.\n\nWe regularly review our intangible and tangible assets\nfor impairment, including identifiable intangible assets\nand goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of opera-\ntions and financial condition.

Such steps\ncould include “quantitative easing” measures and poten-\ntial withdrawals by countries from common currencies.\nIn addition, countries facing local financial difficulties,\nincluding countries experiencing high inflation rates and\nhighly indebted countries facing large capital outflows,\nmay impose controls on the exchange of foreign cur-\nrency. Currency exchange controls could limit our ability\nto distribute retained earnings from our local affiliates,\nor to pay intercompany payables due from those coun-\ntries.\n\nDespite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge\nagainst foreign currency exchange risks, because a sig-\nnificant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in\ncurrencies other than the US dollar, including expendi-\ntures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than\nour revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate vol-\natility may negatively and materially impact our results\nof operations and financial condition, and may impact\nthe reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and\nliabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such vola-\ntility can be difficult to predict. Further, depending on the\nmovements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may\nbe materially adversely affected at a time when the same\ncurrency movements are benefiting some of our com-\npetitors.\n\nFor more information on the effects of currency fluc-\ntuations on our consolidated financial statements and\non how we manage currency risk, see “Item 5.

We may also  have difficulty refinancing our existing debt or incurring  new debt on terms that we would consider to be com- mercially reasonable, if at all. \nGoodwill and intangible assets \nRisk description \nGoodwill and intangible assets resulting in significant  impairment charges \nContext and potential impact \nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and other  intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet,  including, in particular, substantial goodwill and other  intangible assets obtained through acquisitions, includ- ing most recently through our acquisitions of The  Medicines Company,  Xiidra , Endocyte, Novartis Gene  Therapies, AAA, and certain oncology products from  GSK. As a result, we may incur significant impairment  charges in the future if the fair value of the intangible  assets and the groupings of cash-generating units con- taining goodwill would be less than their carrying value  on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet at any point  in time. \nWe regularly review our intangible and tangible assets  for impairment, including identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill. Any significant impairment charges could  have a material adverse effect on our results of opera- tions and financial condition. In 2021, for example, we  recorded intangible asset impairment charges of USD  403 million.  \n\nFor a detailed discussion of how we determine  whether an impairment has occurred, what factors could  result in an impairment, and the impact of impairment  charges on our results of operations, see Item 18. Finan- cial Statements—Note 1. Significant accounting policies”  and “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 11. Goodwill  and intangible assets.” \nForeign currency exchange rates \nRisk description \nNegative effect on financial results due to foreign cur- rency exchange rate fluctuations \nContext and potential impact \nChanges in exchange rates between the US dollar, our  reporting currency, and other currencies can result in  significant increases or decreases in our reported sales,  costs and earnings as expressed in US dollars, and in  the reported value of our assets, liabilities and cash flows. \nIn addition to ordinary market risk, there is a risk that  countries could take affirmative steps that could signifi- cantly impact the value of their currencies. Such steps  could include “quantitative easing” measures and poten- tial withdrawals by countries from common currencies.  In addition, countries facing local financial difficulties,  including countries experiencing high inflation rates and  highly indebted countries facing large capital outflows,  may impose controls on the exchange of foreign cur- rency. Currency exchange controls could limit our ability  to distribute retained earnings from our local affiliates,  or to pay intercompany payables due from those coun- tries.  \nDespite measures undertaken to reduce or hedge  against foreign currency exchange risks, because a sig- nificant portion of our earnings and expenditures are in  currencies other than the US dollar, including expendi- tures in Swiss francs that are significantly higher than  our revenue in Swiss francs, any such exchange rate vol- atility may negatively and materially impact our results  of operations and financial condition, and may impact  the reported value of our net sales, earnings, assets and  liabilities. In addition, the timing and extent of such vola- tility can be difficult to predict. Further, depending on the  movements of particular foreign exchange rates, we may  be materially adversely affected at a time when the same  currency movements are benefiting some of our com- petitors. \nFor more information on the effects of currency fluc- tuations on our consolidated financial statements and  on how we manage currency risk, see “Item 5. Operat- ing and Financial Review and Prospects—Item 5.B Liquid- ity and capital resources—Effects of currency fluctua- tions” and “Item 18. Financial Statements—Note 29.  Financial instruments – additional disclosures.” \nKey customers \nRisk description \nOngoing consolidation among our distributors and retail- ers, and the concentration of credit risk "}

Key Information\n\nContext and potential impact\n\nIncreasingly, a significant portion of our global sales is\nmade to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers,\nretail chains and other purchasing organizations. For\nexample, our three most important customers globally\naccounted for approximately 17%, 11% and 6%, respec-\ntively, of net sales in 2021. The largest trade receivables\noutstanding were for these three customers, amounting\nto 16%, 12% and 7%, respectively, of the Group’s trade\nreceivables at December 31, 2021. The trend has been\ntoward further consolidation among distributors and\nretailers. As aresult, we may be affected by fluctuations\nin the buying patterns of such customers. Furthermore,\nthese customers are gaining additional purchasing lever-\nage, increasing the pricing pressures facing our busi-\nnesses. These pressures can particularly impact our\nSandoz Division, the generic products of which can often\nbe obtained from numerous competitors. Moreover, we\nare exposed to a concentration of credit risk as a result\nof this concentration among our customers. If one or\nmore of our major customers experienced financial dif-\nficulties, the effect on us would be substantial, and could\ninclude a substantial loss of sales and an inability to col-\nlect amounts owed to us.\n\nEnvironmental matters\n\nRisk description\nImpact of environmental liabilities\n\nContext and potential impact\n\nThe environmental laws of various jurisdictions impose\nactual and potential obligations on us to investigate and\nremediate contaminated sites, including in connection\nwith activities in the past by businesses that are no lon-\nger part of Novartis. In some cases, these remediation\nefforts may take many years. While we have set aside\nprovisions for known worldwide environmental liabilities\nthat are probable and estimable, there is no guarantee\nthat additional costs will not be incurred beyond the\namounts for which we have provided in the Group con-\nsolidated financial statements.

In\nregions where this risk is present, it impacts not only our\nown operations but also our distributed supply chain.\nSuch events may result in increased costs, business\ninterruptions, destruction of facilities, loss of life, and dis-\nruption to healthcare systems that patients use to access\nour medicines.\n\nClimate change may trigger the adoption of new reg-\nulatory requirements across the globe. Such legislation\ncould include increased requirements to invest in tech-\nnology to reduce energy use, water use and greenhouse\ngas emissions, beyond what we expect to invest in our\nexisting plans. In addition, legislation could include car-\nbon pricing, climate risk disclosure mandates, and\nchanges in zoning or building codes to increase climate\nresilience. The combined impact of these transition risks\ncould increase our direct operating costs and result in\nthe same impact across our supply chain. As a result of\nthese transition risks, we are committed to becoming\ncarbon neutral in our own operations by 2025, and car-\nbon neutral across our value chain by 2030. In addition,\nwe are committed to achieving net zero across our value\nchain by 2040. Any failure to achieve these commitments\nin the expected time frame, or at all, could result in neg-\native impacts to our reputation, our operations, and the\nprice of our shares.\n\nFurthermore, our corporate headquarters, the head-\nquarters of our Innovative Medicines and Sandoz Divi-\nsions, and certain of our major Innovative Medicines Divi-\nsion production and research facilities are located near\nearthquake fault lines in Basel, Switzerland.

At the same time, new entrants are looking\nto use their expertise to establish or expand their pres-\nence in healthcare, including technology companies\nseeking to benefit from the increasing importance of\ndata and data management in our industry.\n\nResearch and development\n\nThe discovery and development of a new drug usually\nrequires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial\nresearch to bringing a drug to market. This includes\napproximately six to eight years from Phase | clinical tri-\nals to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a\nsubstantial risk that a compound (i.e., drug or biologic)\nor other therapeutic candidate will not meet the require-\nments to progress further. In such an event, we may be\nrequired to abandon the development of a potential ther-\napy in which we have made a substantial investment.\n\nWe manage our research and development expendi-\ntures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our\nstrategic priorities. We make decisions about whether\nor not to proceed with development projects on a proj-\nect-by-project basis. These decisions are based on the\nproject’s potential to meet a significant unmet medical\nneed or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the\nscience underlying the project, and the potential of the\nproject (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical\ndevelopment) to generate significant positive financial\nresults for the Company. Once a management decision\nhas been made to proceed with the development of a\nparticular molecule, the level of research and develop-\nment investment required will be driven by many factors.\nThese include the medical indications for which it is being\ndeveloped, the number of indications being pursued,\nwhether the molecule is of a chemical or biological\nnature, the stage of development, and the level of evi-\ndence necessary to demonstrate clinical efficacy and\nsafety.\n\nResearch program\n\nOur research program is conducted by the Novartis Insti-\ntutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), which is the\nresearch and early development innovation engine of\nNovartis. NIBR is responsible for the discovery of new\nmedicines for diseases with unmet medical need. We\nfocus our work in areas where we believe we can have\nthe most impact for patients. This requires the hiring and\nretention of highly talented employees, a focus on fun-\ndamental disease mechanisms that are relevant across\ndifferent disease areas, continuous improvement in tech-\nnologies for drug discovery and potential therapies,\nclose alliances with clinical colleagues, and the estab-\nlishment of strategic external alliances.\n\nApproximately 5 200 full-time-equivalent scientists,\nphysicians and business professionals work at NIBR\nsites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts;\nEast Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California;\nEmeryville, California; and Shanghai, China. They con-\ntribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovas-\ncular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience;\noncology; muscle disorders; ophthalmology; autoim-\nmune diseases; and respiratory and allergic diseases.\n\n34\n\nResearch at the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the\nGenomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation\nfocuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and the\nNovartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), in\nEmeryville, California, focuses on discovering new\nmedicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria\nand cryptosporidiosis.\n\nAll drug candidates go through proof-of-concept tri-\nals to enable an early assessment of the safety and effi-\ncacy of the drug while collecting basic information on\npharmacokinetics and tolerability, and adhering to the\nguidance for early clinical testing set forth by health\nauthorities.

At the same time, new entrants are looking  to use their expertise to establish or expand their pres- ence in healthcare, including technology companies  seeking to benefit from the increasing importance of  data and data management in our industry. \nResearch and development \nThe discovery and development of a new drug usually  requires approximately 10 to 15 years from the initial  research to bringing a drug to market. This includes  approximately six to eight years from Phase I clinical tri- als to market entry. At each of these steps, there is a  substantial risk that a compound (i.e., drug or biologic)  or other therapeutic candidate will not meet the require- ments to progress further. In such an event, we may be  required to abandon the development of a potential ther- apy in which we have made a substantial investment. \nWe manage our research and development expendi- tures across our entire portfolio in accordance with our  strategic priorities. We make decisions about whether  or not to proceed with development projects on a proj- ect‑by‑project basis. These decisions are based on the  project’s potential to meet a significant unmet medical  need or to improve patient outcomes, the strength of the  science underlying the project, and the potential of the  project (subject to the risks inherent in pharmaceutical  development) to generate significant positive financial  results for the Company. Once a management decision  has been made to proceed with the development of a  particular molecule, the level of research and develop- ment investment required will be driven by many factors.  These include the medical indications for which it is being  developed, the number of indications being pursued,  whether the molecule is of a chemical or biological  nature, the stage of development, and the level of evi- dence necessary to demonstrate clinical efficacy and  safety.  \nResearch program \nOur research program is conducted by the Novartis Insti- tutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), which is the  research and early development innovation engine of  Novartis. NIBR is responsible for the discovery of new  medicines for diseases with unmet medical need. We  focus our work in areas where we believe we can have  the most impact for patients. This requires the hiring and  retention of highly talented employees, a focus on fun- damental disease mechanisms that are relevant across  different disease areas, continuous improvement in tech- nologies for drug discovery and potential therapies,  close alliances with clinical colleagues, and the estab- lishment of strategic external alliances. \nApproximately 5 200 full‑time-equivalent scientists,  physicians and business professionals work at NIBR  sites in Basel, Switzerland; Cambridge, Massachusetts;  East Hanover, New Jersey; San Diego, California;  Emeryville, California; and Shanghai, China. They con- tribute to research into disease areas such as cardiovas- cular, renal and metabolic diseases; neuroscience;  oncology; muscle disorders; ophthalmology; autoim- mune diseases; and respiratory and allergic diseases.  \nResearch at the Friedrich Miescher Institute and the  Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation  focuses on basic genetic and genomic research, and the  Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), in  Emeryville, California, focuses on discovering new  medicines to fight tropical diseases, including malaria  and crypto spor i dios is. \nAll drug candidates go through proof‑of‑concept tri- als to enable an early assessment of the safety and effi- cacy of the drug while collecting basic information on  p harm a co kinetics and tolerability, and adhering to the  guidance for early clinical testing set forth by health  authorities. Following proof of concept, our Global Drug  Development unit conducts confirmatory trials on the  drug candidates. \nIn 2020, we discontinued early discovery research  at NIBR’s Shanghai site and focused our research and  development activities there on expanding the scale and  scope of our early clinical development and later-stage  clinical trial operations to help accelerate the develop- ment of new medicines. \nIn response to the current pandemic, we are pursu- ing potential therapeutic strategies to help combat  COVID-19.

The pharmaceutical\ndevelopment and registration process is typically inten-\nsive, lengthy and rigorous. When a pharmaceutical com-\npany has gathered data that it believes sufficiently\ndemonstrates a drug's safety, efficacy and quality, then\nthe company may file a New Drug Application (NDA) or\nBiologics License Application (BLA), as applicable, for\nthe compound.

In the\nMRP, the company first obtains a marketing authoriza-\ntion in the RMS, which is then recognized by the con-\ncerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the appli-\ncation is done simultaneously in the RMS and all\nconcerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS\ndrafts an assessment report within 120 days. Within an\nadditional 90 days, the concerned member states review\nthe application and can issue objections or requests for\nadditional information. On Day 90, each concerned mem-\nber state must be assured that the product is safe and\neffective, and that it will cause no risks to the public\nhealth. Once an agreement has been reached, each\nmember state grants national marketing authorizations\nfor the product.\n\nAfter receiving the marketing authorizations, the\ncompany must submit periodic safety reports to the rel-\nevant health authority (EMA for the centralized proce-\ndure, national health authorities for DCP or MRP). In addi-\ntion, pharmacovigilance measures must be implemented\nand monitored, including the collection, evaluation and\nexpedited reporting of adverse events, and updates to\nrisk management plans. For some medications, post-ap-\nproval studies (Phase IV) may be imposed to comple-\nment available data with additional data to evaluate long-\nterm effects (called a Post-Approval Safety Study, or\nPASS) or to gather additional efficacy data (called a\nPost-Approval Efficacy Study, or PAES).\n\nEuropean marketing authorizations have an initial\nduration of five years. The holder of the marketing autho-\nrization must actively apply for its renewal after this first\nfive-year period. As part of the renewal procedure, the\ncompetent authority will perform a full benefit-risk review\nof the product. Should the authority conclude that the\nbenefit-risk balance is no longer positive, the marketing\nauthorization can be suspended or revoked. Once\nrenewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlim-\nited period, unless it is determined that the product must\nbe further monitored for safety reasons. In this case, the\nauthority may require another renewal at 10 years. If the\nholder does not apply for renewal, the marketing autho-\nrization automatically lapses. Any marketing authoriza-\ntion that is not followed within three years of its granting\nby the actual placing on the market of the correspond-\ning medicinal product ceases to be valid.\n\n37\n\nPrice controls\n\nIn most of the markets where we operate, the prices of\npharmaceutical products are subject to both direct and\nindirect price controls and to drug reimbursement pro-\ngrams with varying price control mechanisms.

The term of a patent\ngranted by the EPO or a European country office is\n20 years from the earliest application filing date. Phar-\nmaceutical patents can be granted a further period of\nexclusivity under the SPC system. SPCs are designed,\nin part, to account for the time it took to receive market-\ning authorization of a product by the European health\nauthorities. An SPC may be granted to provide, in com-\nbination with the patent, up to 15 years of exclusivity from\nthe date of the first European marketing authorization.\nHowever, an SPC cannot last longer than five years. The\nSPC duration may be extended by a further six months\nif the product is the subject of an agreed pediatric inves-\ntigation plan. The post-grant phase of patents, including\nthe SPC system, is currently administered on a coun-\ntry-by-country basis under national laws that, while dif-\nfering, are intended to (but do not always) have the same\neffect.\n\n39\n\nRDPand market exclusivity\n\nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the EU provides a\nsystem of regulatory data protection for authorized\nhuman medicines that runs in parallel to any patent pro-\ntection. The system for new drugs being approved today\nis usually referred to as “8+2+1” because it provides an\ninitial period of eight years of data protection, during\nwhich a competitor cannot rely on the relevant data; a\nfurther period of two years of market exclusivity, during\nwhich the data can be used to support applications for\nmarketing authorization but a competitive product can-\nnot be launched; and a possible one-year extension of\nthe market exclusivity periodif, during the initial eight-year\ndata exclusivity period, the sponsor registered a new\ntherapeutic indication with “significant clinical benefit.”\nThis system applies both to national and centralized\nauthorizations in the EU plus other non-EU countries\nsuch as the UK.\n\nThe EU also has an orphan drug exclusivity system\nfor medicines. If a medicine is designated as an orphan\ndrug, then it benefits from 10 years of market exclusivity\nafter it is authorized, during which time an application for\nthe same or similar medicine for the same indication will\nnot generally be accepted or granted. Under certain cir-\ncumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a\ntwo-year pediatric extension.\n\nThird-party patents and challenges to intellectual\nproperty\n\nThird parties can challenge our IP, including patents, pat-\nent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities\n(such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusiv-\nity), through various proceedings. For example, patents\nin the US can be challenged in the USPTO through var-\nious proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and\nPost-Grant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also\nbe challenged through patent infringement litigation\nunder the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)\nprovisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act or under the Bio-\nlogics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In\nthe EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions\nin the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in\nnational courts or national patent offices. The outcomes\nof such challenges can be difficult to predict.\n\nIn addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in\nsome circumstances a competitor may be able to mar-\nket a generic version of one of our products by, for exam-\nple, designing around our patents or marketing the\ngeneric product for non-patent-protected indications, or\nfiling a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the\nHatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2)\napplication). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur\nthe costs of conducting its own clinical trials and prepar-\ning its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP\naltogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek\nto impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the\navailability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or\nlimit the extent to which such rights may be enforced.\nAlso, even though we may own, co-own or in-license pat-\nents protecting our products, and conduct free-\ndom-to-operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless\nassert that one of our products infringes a third-party\npatent for which we do not have a license, seeking rem-\n\n", "vlm_text": "\nRDP and market exclusivity \nSeparate from patent exclusivities, the FDA may provide  RDP or regulatory-based market exclusivity, which runs  in parallel to any patent protection. \n\n \n•\t A new small‑molecule active pharmaceutical ingredi- ent receives five years of RDP, during which time a com- petitor generally may not submit or obtain approval of  an application to the FDA based on a sponsor’s clini- cal data.\n\n \n•\t A new biologic active pharmaceutical ingredient  receives 12 years of regulatory-based market exclusiv- ity, during which time a competitor generally may not  market the same or similar drug. \n\n \n•\t The FDA may also request that a sponsor conduct  pediatric studies and, in exchange, it will grant an addi- tional six‑month period of pediatric market exclusivity  if the FDA accepts the data, the sponsor makes a timely  application for approval for pediatric treatment, and  the sponsor has a patent‑based and/or regulato- ry‑based exclusivity period for the product that can be  extended.\n\n \n•\t Orphan drug exclusivity provides seven years of mar- ket exclusivity for drugs designated by the FDA as  orphan drugs, meaning drugs that treat rare diseases.

If a medicine is designated as an orphan  drug, then it benefits from 10 years of market exclusivity  after it is authorized, during which time an application for  the same or similar medicine for the same indication will  not generally be accepted or granted. Under certain cir- cumstances, this exclusivity can be extended with a  two‑year pediatric extension. \nThird-party patents and challenges to intellectual  property \nThird parties can challenge our IP, including patents, pat- ent term extensions, RDP and marketing exclusivities  (such as pediatric extensions and orphan drug exclusiv- ity), through various proceedings. For example, patents  in the US can be challenged in the USPTO through var- ious proceedings, including Inter Partes Review (IPR) and  Post-Grant Review (PGR) proceedings. They may also  be challenged through patent infringement litigation  under the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA)  provisions of the Hatch‑Waxman Act or under the Bio- logics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). In  the EU, patents may be challenged through oppositions  in the EPO, or national patents may be challenged in  national courts or national patent offices. The outcomes  of such challenges can be difficult to predict. \nIn addition to directly challenging our IP rights, in  some circumstances a competitor may be able to mar- ket a generic version of one of our products by, for exam- ple, designing around our patents or marketing the  generic product for non‑patent-protected indications, or  filing a separate New Drug Application (NDA) under the  Hatch-Waxman Act (typically referred to as a 505(b)(2)  application). Despite RDP, a competitor could opt to incur  the costs of conducting its own clinical trials and prepar- ing its own regulatory application, and avoid our RDP  altogether. There is a risk that some countries may seek  to impose limitations on or seek not to recognize the  availability of IP rights for pharmaceutical products, or  limit the extent to which such rights may be enforced.  Also, even though we may own, co‑own or in‑license pat- ents protecting our products, and conduct free- dom‑to‑operate analyses, a third party may nevertheless  assert that one of our products infringes a third-party  patent for which we do not have a license, seeking rem- edies such as monetary damages or an injunction against  our continued marketing of the product.

{"page": 50, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_NVS_2021_50.jpg", "ocr_text": "Item 4. Information on the Company\n\nIn the US, the decision on whether a generic phar-\nmaceutical is therapeutically equivalent to the original\nproduct is made by the FDA based on an Abbreviated\nNew Drug Application (ANDA) filed by the generic prod-\nuct’s manufacturer. An ANDA is generally permitted to\nbe filed four years after the initial approval of the refer-\nence product and generally cannot be fully approved by\nthe FDA until any regulatory exclusivity of the reference\nproduct has expired. The process typically takes nearly\ntwo years from the filing of the ANDA until FDA approval.\nHowever, delays can occur if issues arise, for example,\nregarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study\ndata, labeling requirements for the generic product, or\nqualifying the supply of active ingredients. In addition,\nthe Hatch-Waxman Act requires a generic manufacturer\nto certify in certain situations that the generic product\ndoes not infringe on any current applicable patents on\nthe product held by the holder of the marketing authori-\nzation for the reference product, or to certify that such\npatents are invalid. This certification often results in a\npatent infringement lawsuit being brought against the\ngenerics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the\nHatch-Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month\ndelay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to\nresolve the intellectual property issues. For generic\napplicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing\na certification claiming non-infringement or patent inva-\nlidity, the Hatch-Waxman Act generally provides those\napplicants with 180 days of marketing exclusivity,\nenabling such generic applicants to exclusively market\ntheir product alongside the reference product at a cer-\ntain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual\nproperty issues have been resolved. However, after such\npoint in time, the generic applicants must launch their\nproducts within certain time frames or risk losing the\nmarketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a\nfirst-to-file applicant.\n\nIn the EU, decisions on the granting of a marketing\nauthorization are made either by the European Commis-\nsion based on a positive recommendation by the EMA\nunder the centralized procedure, or by a single member\nstate under the national or decentralized procedure. See\n“—Innovative Medicines—Regulation—European Union.”\nCompanies may submit abridged applications for\napproval of a generic medicinal product based upon its\n“essential similarity” to a medicinal product authorized\nand marketed in the EU following the expiration of the\nproduct’s data exclusivity period. In such cases, the\ngenerics company is able to submit its abridged appli-\ncation based on the data submitted by the innovator com-\npany for the reference product, without the need to con-\nduct extensive Phase Ill clinical trials of its own. For all\nproducts that received a marketing authorization in the\nEU after late 2005, the abridged application can be sub-\nmitted throughout the EU. However, the data submitted\nby the innovator company in support of its application\nfor a marketing authorization for the reference product\nis generally protected for 10 years after the first grant of\nmarketing authorization in all member states, and can be\nextended for an additional year if, during the initial\neight-year data exclusivity period, the innovator company\nregisters a new therapeutic indication with “significant\nclinical benefit.” In the case of orphan drugs, it may be\nextended with a two-year pediatric extension. See “—\n\n47\n\nItem 4.B Business overview—Innovative Medicines—\nIntellectual property.”\n\nBiosimilars\n\nThe regulatory pathways for approval of biosimilar\nmedicines are still being developed and established in\nmany countries of the world. A regulatory framework for\nthe approval of biosimilars has been established in the\nEU, Japan, Canada and the US, while the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) has issued guidance. Sandoz has\nsuccessfully registered and launched the first biosimilar\n(or biosimilar-type) medicine in Europe, the US, Canada,\nJapan, Taiwan, Australia, and many countries in Latin\nAmerica and Asia. Sandoz was the first company to\nsecure approval for and launch a biosimilar under the US\nbiosimilar pathway that was established as part of the\nBiologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).\nThe approval of biosimilars in Europe follows a process\nsimilar to that followed for small molecules. However,\nbiosimilars usually have to be approved through the cen-\ntralized procedure because they are manufactured using\nrecombinant DNA technology. As part of the approval\nprocess in the EU, biosimilars have to demonstrate com-\nparability to the reference medicine in terms of safety,\nefficacy and quality through an extensive comparability\nexercise, based on strict guidelines set by the authori-\nties. Regulators will only approve a biosimilar based on\ndata that allows the regulators to conclude that there are\nno clinically meaningful differences between the refer-\nence medicine and the biosimilar.\n\nIn the US, under the BPCIA, a biosimilar must be\nhighly similar with no clinically meaningful differences\ncompared to the reference medicine. Approval of a bio-\nsimilar in the US requires the submission of a BLA to the\nFDA, including an assessment of immunogenicity and\npharmacokinetics; an efficacy study; and possibly a phar-\nmacodynamics study. The BLA for a biosimilar can be\nsubmitted as soon as four years after the initial approval\nof the reference biologic, but can only be approved\n12 years after the initial approval of the reference bio-\nlogic.\n\nIntellectual property\n\nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure that our products\ndo not infringe valid intellectual property rights held by\nothers, including taking steps to proactively challenge\nintellectual property rights that we believe should not\nhave been granted. Nevertheless, competing companies\ncommonly assert patent and other intellectual property\nrights. As aresult, we can become involved in significant\nlitigation regarding our products. If we are unsuccessful\nin defending these suits, we could be subject to injunc-\ntions preventing us from selling our products and to\npotentially substantial damages.\n\nWherever possible, our products are protected by\nour own patents. Among other things, patents may cover\nthe products themselves, including the product’s formu-\nlation, or the processes for manufacturing a product.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that our intellectual\nproperty will protect our products or that we will be able\n", "vlm_text": "In the US, the decision on whether a generic phar- maceutical is therapeutically equivalent to the original  product is made by the FDA based on an Abbreviated  New Drug Application (ANDA) filed by the generic prod- uct’s manufacturer.

However, delays can occur if issues arise, for example,  regarding the interpretation of bioequivalence study  data, labeling requirements for the generic product, or  qualifying the supply of active ingredients.

This certification often results in a  patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the  generics company. In the event of such a lawsuit, the  Hatch‑Waxman Act imposes an automatic 30-month  delay in the approval of the ANDA to allow the parties to  resolve the intellectual property issues. For generic  applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing  a certification claiming non‑infringement or patent inva- lidity, the Hatch‑Waxman Act generally provides those  applicants with 180  days of marketing exclusivity,  enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market  their product alongside the reference product at a cer- tain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual  property issues have been resolved. However, after such  point in time, the generic applicants must launch their  products within certain time frames or risk losing the  marketing exclusivity that they had gained by being a  first-to-file applicant. \nIn the EU, decisions on the granting of a marketing  authorization are made either by the European Commis- sion based on a positive recommendation by the EMA  under the centralized procedure, or by a single member  state under the national or decentralized procedure. See  “—Innovative Medicines—Regulation—European Union.”  Companies may submit abridged applications for  approval of a generic medicinal product based upon its  “essential similarity” to a medicinal product authorized  and marketed in the EU following the expiration of the  product’s data exclusivity period. In such cases, the  generics company is able to submit its abridged appli- cation based on the data submitted by the innovator com- pany for the reference product, without the need to con- duct extensive Phase III clinical trials of its own. For all  products that received a marketing authorization in the  EU after late 2005, the abridged application can be sub- mitted throughout the EU. However, the data submitted  by the innovator company in support of its application  for a marketing authorization for the reference product  is generally protected for 10 years after the first grant of  marketing authorization in all member states, and can be  extended for an additional year if, during the initial  eight‑year data exclusivity period, the innovator company  registers a new therapeutic indication with “significant  clinical benefit.” In the case of orphan drugs, it may be  extended with a two‑year pediatric extension. See “— Item 4.B Business overview—Innovative Medicines— Intellectual property.”  \n\nBiosimilars \nThe regulatory pathways for approval of biosimilar  medicines are still being developed and established in  many countries of the world. A regulatory framework for  the approval of biosimilars has been established in the  EU, Japan, Canada and the US, while the World Health  Organization (WHO) has issued guidance. Sandoz has  successfully registered and launched the first biosimilar  (or biosimilar-type) medicine in Europe, the US, Canada,  Japan, Taiwan, Australia, and many countries in Latin  America and Asia. Sandoz was the first company to  secure approval for and launch a biosimilar under the US  biosimilar pathway that was established as part of the  Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA).  The approval of biosimilars in Europe follows a process  similar to that followed for small molecules. However,  biosimilars usually have to be approved through the cen- tralized procedure because they are manufactured using  recombinant DNA technology. As part of the approval  process in the EU, biosimilars have to demonstrate com- parability to the reference medicine in terms of safety,  efficacy and quality through an extensive comparability  exercise, based on strict guidelines set by the authori- ties. Regulators will only approve a biosimilar based on  data that allows the regulators to conclude that there are  no clinically meaningful differences between the refer- ence medicine and the biosimilar. \nIn the US, under the BPCIA, a biosimilar must be  highly similar with no clinically meaningful differences  compared to the reference medicine. Approval of a bio- similar in the US requires the submission of a BLA to the  FDA, including an assessment of immunogenicity and  p harm a co kinetics; an efficacy study; and possibly a phar - macodynamics study. The BLA for a biosimilar can be  submitted as soon as four years after the initial approval  of the reference biologic, but can only be approved  12 years after the initial approval of the reference bio- logic.  \nIntellectual property \nWe take all reasonable steps to ensure that our products  do not infringe valid intellectual property rights held by  others, including taking steps to proactively challenge  intellectual property rights that we believe should not  have been granted. Nevertheless, competing companies  commonly assert patent and other intellectual property  rights. As a result, we can become involved in significant  litigation regarding our products. If we are unsuccessful  in defending these suits, we could be subject to injunc- tions preventing us from selling our products and to  potentially substantial damages. \nWherever possible, our products are protected by  our own patents. Among other things, patents may cover  the products themselves, including the product’s formu- lation, or the processes for manufacturing a product.  However, there can be no assurance that our intellectual  property will protect our products or that we will be able  "}

{"page": 55, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_NVS_2021_55.jpg", "ocr_text": "Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\n\n¢ Use of data and technology is expanding across our\nindustry. The use of data science and digital technolo-\ngies is increasing rapidly across our industry - in every-\nthing from clinical trials and manufacturing to patient\ndiagnostics and treatment. COVID-19 has accelerated\nthis trend. Meanwhile, customers want more efficient\nand personalized ways to connect with pharmaceuti-\ncal companies. Against this backdrop, data privacy and\ncybersecurity are growing in importance.\n\n* Access to healthcare remains a global challenge.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO),\nalmost a third of the world’s population does not have\naccess to the medicines they need. For the past five\nyears, access rates in the poorest countries have been\ndeclining. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has\nhighlighted deep health inequities in both developed\nand developing countries. Access can be improved by\nintegrating access strategies into how we research,\ndevelop and deliver our new medicines globally.\n\n¢ Aging populations are driving a rise in noncommunica-\nble diseases. As the complexity of the world’s health-\ncare challenges grows, the nature of the global disease\nburden is also changing. Aging populations are fueling\na rise in noncommunicable conditions such as heart\ndisease and cancer, driving an increase in disability and\nputting additional pressure on healthcare systems.\nNew ways of working are here to stay even after COVID-\n19. COVID-19 changed our work habits. Post-pandemic,\nmany employees continue to want more flexibility in\nhow they work. Within our own workforce, there is more\nemphasis on digital skills, which are in increasingly\nshort supply across the economy. At the same time,\nworkplace diversity has become more important than\never to attract and retain talented employees, and sup-\nport innovation.\nClimate crisis is threatening to undermine global health\ngains. Climate change is already causing extreme heat\nand poor air quality in some areas, which threaten to\nexacerbate pre-existing health conditions such as\nrespiratory diseases. In addition, an increase in tem-\nperature and humidity may cause a proliferation of\ninsects that carry vector-borne diseases, including\ndengue fever and malaria. Ultimately, climate change\ncould undermine decades of progress in improving\nhuman health at a time when antimicrobial resistance\nis also rising.\nThere is an opportunity to build public trust in wake of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has brought an\nopportunity to reset public trust in our industry, with\ncompanies working together to end the pandemic.\nTrust matters for our industry: Our success depends\non patents and trademarks that are granted by society\nand protect the long-term investments required for our\nbusiness. Trust also matters for patient engagement,\nfor working with regulators and policymakers, and for\nattracting talented employees.\n\nOur strategy\n\nOur strategy is to build a focused medicines company\npowered by technology leadership in research and\ndevelopment (R&D), world-class commercialization,\n\n52\n\nglobal access and data science. In 2021, we continued\nto execute on this strategy, as reflected by our com-\nmencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division\nand the divestment of our investment in Roche in a bilat-\neral transaction with Roche (see “Item 18. Financial\nStatements—Note 2. Significant transactions”). As we\nimplement our strategy, we have five priorities to shape\nour future and help us continue to create value for our\ncompany, our shareholders and society:\n\nDeliver transformative innovation\n\nIn our pursuit of transformative treatments, we seek to\nfind new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic\nillnesses and improve patients’ quality of life. We have\none of the strongest clinical development programs in\nthe industry, with more than 275 research programs as\nwell as 98 assets in development spanning around 50\ndiseases - from heart disease and cancer to rare but\ndebilitating genetic disorders - and 71 new molecular\nentities, with the potential to transform the standard of\ncare for patients.\n\nWe invest in technology platforms - including cell and\ngene therapies and radioligand therapies - that offer\nmore targeted approaches to fighting and, in some\ncases, potentially curing serious diseases. We invested\nUSD 9.5 billion in research and development in 2021, or\napproximately 18.5% of our net sales. We use data and\ndigital strategies in our research and development oper-\nations to open new paths to scientific discovery, improve\npatient outcomes and streamline the development pro-\ncess. We also focus our R&D capabilities on global health\nchallenges like malaria and sickle cell disease.\n\nEmbrace operational excellence\n\nWe work to improve the productivity of our operations\nwhile maintaining high standards of patient safety and\nenvironmental sustainability.

The use of data science and digital technolo- gies is increasing rapidly across our industry – in every- thing from clinical trials and manufacturing to patient  diagnostics and treatment. COVID-19 has accelerated  this trend. Meanwhile, customers want more efficient  and personalized ways to connect with pharmaceuti- cal companies. Against this backdrop, data privacy and  cybersecurity are growing in importance.\n\n \n•\t  Access to healthcare remains a global challenge . According to the World Health Organization (WHO),  almost a third of the world’s population does not have  access to the medicines they need. For the past five  years, access rates in the poorest countries have been  declining. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic has  highlighted deep health inequities in both developed  and developing countries. Access can be improved by  integrating access strategies into how we research,  develop and deliver our new medicines globally.\n\n \n•\t  Aging populations are driving a rise in noncommunica- ble diseases .   As the complexity of the world’s health- care challenges grows, the nature of the global disease  burden is also changing. Aging populations are fueling  a rise in noncommunicable conditions such as heart  disease and cancer, driving an increase in disability and  putting additional pressure on healthcare systems.\n\n \n •\t New ways of working are here to stay even after COVID- 19.  COVID-19 changed our work habits. Post-pandemic,  many employees continue to want more flexibility in  how they work. Within our own workforce, there is more  emphasis on digital skills, which are in increasingly  short supply across the economy. At the same time,  workplace diversity has become more important than  ever to attract and retain talented employees, and sup- port innovation.\n\n \n•\t  Climate crisis is threatening to undermine global health  gains.  Climate change is already causing extreme heat  and poor air quality in some areas, which threaten to  exacerbate pre-existing health conditions such as  respiratory diseases. In addition, an increase in tem- perature and humidity may cause a proliferation of  insects that carry vector-borne diseases, including  dengue fever and malaria. Ultimately, climate change  could undermine decades of progress in improving  human health at a time when antimicrobial resistance  is also rising.\n\n \n •\t There is an opportunity to build public trust in wake of  the COVID-19 pandemic.  COVID-19 has brought an  opportunity to reset public trust in our industry, with  companies working together to end the pandemic.  Trust matters for our industry: Our success depends  on patents and trademarks that are granted by society  and protect the long-term investments required for our  business. Trust also matters for patient engagement,  for working with regulators and policymakers, and for  attracting talented employees. \nOur strategy \nOur strategy is to build a focused medicines company  powered by technology leadership in research and  development (R&D), world-class commercialization,  global access and data science. In 2021, we continued  to execute on this strategy, as reflected by our com- mencement of a strategic review of our Sandoz Division  and the divestment of our investment in Roche in a bilat- eral transaction with Roche (see “Item 18. Financial  Statements—Note 2. Significant transactions”). As we  implement our strategy, we have five priorities to shape  our future and help us continue to create value for our  company, our shareholders and society:  \n\nDeliver transformative innovation \nIn our pursuit of transformative treatments, we seek to  find new ways to cure disease, intervene earlier in chronic  illnesses and improve patients’ quality of life. We have  one of the strongest clinical development programs in  the industry, with more than 275 research programs as  well as 98 assets in development spanning around 50  diseases – from heart disease and cancer to rare but  debilitating genetic disorders – and 71 new molecular  entities, with the potential to transform the standard of  care for patients.  \nWe invest in technology platforms – including cell and  gene therapies and radioligand therapies – that offer  more targeted approaches to fighting and, in some  cases, potentially curing serious diseases. We invested  USD 9.5 billion in research and development in 2021, or  approximately   $18.5\\%$   of our net sales. We use data and  digital strategies in our research and development oper- ations to open new paths to scientific discovery, improve  patient outcomes and streamline the development pro- cess. We also focus our R&D capabilities on global health  challenges like malaria and sickle cell disease.  \nEmbrace operational excellence \nWe work to improve the productivity of our operations  while maintaining high standards of patient safety and  environmental sustainability. Our efforts cut across the  Company, with special emphasis on manufacturing and  our supply chain, new product launches and business  services. These activities underpin our investment in  innovation and support our financial performance, while  helping to build trust with stakeholders. In our commer- cial operations, we are taking steps to deliver more  focused and consistent launches across key markets to  support our long-term financial performance and pro- vide better outcomes for patients and customers.   \nWe are transforming our manufacturing operations  to support our strategy, while reducing the environmen- tal footprint of our facilities and helping to produce vac- cines for COVID-19. In addition, patient health and safety  is fundamental to our purpose, and our activities in this  regard are focused on three areas: product quality, phar- macovigilance and combating falsified medicines. Our  supply chain is key to the resilience of our operations:  We identify, assess, monitor and mitigate risk associated  with suppliers through our Third-Party Risk Management  framework, which promotes ethical behavior and fosters  sustainability. With a view toward delivering efficient and  effective business services, in 2021 we merged all busi- ness services and technology operations into a new  organization called Customer & Technology Solutions  (CTS). CTS will further accelerate productivity improve- ments while investing to support the business to imple- ment our strategy. "}

Because of uncertainties inherent in such judgments,  actual outcomes and results may differ from our assump- tions and estimates, which could materially affect the  Group’s consolidated financial statements.

These deductions represent estimates of the related  obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimat- ing the effect of these sales deductions on gross sales  for a reporting period.

Calculating the  rebates to be paid related to this program involves inter- preting relevant regulations, which are subject to chal- lenge or change in interpretative guidance by govern- ment authorities. Provisions for estimating Medicaid  rebates are calculated using a combination of historical  experience, product and population growth, product  pricing, and the mix of contracts and specific terms in  the individual state agreements.

Operating and Financial Review and Prospects\n\npricing, and the mix of contracts and specific terms in\nthe individual state agreements.\n\nThe United States Federal Medicare Program, which\nfunds healthcare benefits to individuals aged 65 and\nolder, and to people with certain disabilities, provides\nprescription drug benefits under the Part D section of\nthe program. This benefit is provided and administered\nthrough private prescription drug plans. Provisions for\nestimating Medicare Part D rebates are calculated based\non the terms of individual plan agreements, product sales\nand population growth, product pricing, and the mix of\ncontracts.\n\nWe offer rebates to key managed healthcare and pri-\nvate plans in an effort to ensure patient access to our\nproducts and to sustain and increase the market share\nof our products. These programs provide a rebate after\nthe plans have demonstrated they have met all terms and\nconditions set forth in their contract with us.\n\nThese rebates are estimated based on the terms of\nindividual agreements, historical experience, product\npricing and projected product growth rates, and are\nrecorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the\nrelated revenues are recorded.\n\nThese provisions are adjusted based on established\nprocesses and experiences from filing data with individ-\nual states and plans. There is often a time lag of several\nmonths between recording of the revenue deductions\nand the final accounting for them.\n\nNon-United States-specific healthcare plans and\nprogram rebates\n\nIncertain countries other than the US, we provide rebates\nto governments and other entities. These rebates are\noften mandated by laws or government regulations.\nThese rebates are estimated based on government reg-\nulations, laws and terms of individual rebate arrange-\nments, historical experience and other relevant factors,\nand are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the\ntime the related revenue is recorded. These estimates\nare adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience.\nThere is often a time lag of several months between the\nrecording of revenue deductions and the final account-\ning for them.\n\nInnovative pay-for-performance arrangements\n\nWe enter into innovative pay-for-performance arrange-\nments (i.e. outcome based arrangements) with certain\nhealthcare providers and governments. Under these\nagreements, we may be required to make refunds, defer\na portion of the sales price until anticipated treatment\noutcomes meet predefined targets, or to provide addi-\ntional medicines free of charge if anticipated treatment\noutcomes do not meet predefined targets.\n\nThe impact of potential refunds, deferral of a portion\nof the sales price, or the delivery of additional medicines\natnocostis estimated and recorded as a deduction from\nrevenue at the time the related revenues are recorded.\nEstimates are based on historical experience and clini-\ncal data. In cases where historical experience and clini-\ncal data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation of the\noutcome, revenue recognition is deferred until such his-\ntory is available.\n\nThese provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted\nperiodically based on established processes and actual\n\n86\n\nexperience, including the products actual outcomes\nachieved compared to the anticipated predefined tar-\ngets.\n\nThere is often a time lag of several months between\nrecording of the revenue deductions and the final\naccounting for them.\n\nNon-healthcare plans and program rebates, returns\nand other deductions\n\nWe offer rebates to purchasing organizations and other\ndirect and indirect customers to sustain and increase\nmarket share and to ensure patient access to our prod-\nucts. Since rebates are contractually agreed upon, the\nrelated provisions are estimated based on the terms of\nthe individual agreements, historical experience and pro-\njected product sales growth rates.\n\nChargebacks occur where our subsidiaries have\narrangements with indirect customers to sell products\nat prices that are lower than the price charged to whole-\nsalers. A chargeback represents the difference between\nthe invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect cus-\ntomer’s contract price. We account for chargebacks by\nreducing revenue by the estimate of chargebacks attrib-\nutable to a sales transaction. Provisions for estimated\nchargebacks are calculated using a combination of fac-\ntors, such as historical experience, product growth rates,\nproduct pricing, level of inventory in the distribution chan-\nnel, and the terms of individual agreements.\n\nWhen we sell a product providing acustomer the right\nto return it, we record a provision for estimated sales\nreturns based on our sales return policy and historical\nreturn rates. Other factors considered include actual\nproduct recalls, expected marketplace changes, the\nremaining shelf life of the product, and the expected\nentry of generic products. In2021, sales returns amounted\nto approximately 1% of gross product sales. If sufficient\nexperience is not available, sales are only recorded\nbased on evidence of product consumption or when the\nright of return has expired.\n\nWe enter into distribution service agreements with\nmajor wholesalers, which provide a financial disincentive\nfor the wholesalers to purchase product quantities in\nexcess of current customer demand.

This benefit is provided and administered  through private prescription drug plans. Provisions for  estimating Medicare Part D rebates are calculated based  on the terms of individual plan agreements, product sales  and population growth, product pricing, and the mix of  contracts. \nWe offer rebates to key managed healthcare and pri- vate plans in an effort to ensure patient access to our  products and to sustain and increase the market share  of our products. These programs provide a rebate after  the plans have demonstrated they have met all terms and  conditions set forth in their contract with us.  \nThese rebates are estimated based on the terms of  individual agreements, historical experience, product  pricing and projected product growth rates, and are  recorded as a deduction from revenue at the time the  related revenues are recorded.  \nThese provisions are adjusted based on established  processes and experiences from filing data with individ- ual states and plans. There is often a time lag of several  months between recording of the revenue deductions  and the final accounting for them. \nNon-United States-specific healthcare plans and  program rebates \nIn certain countries other than the US, we provide rebates  to governments and other entities. These rebates are  often mandated by laws or government regulations.  These rebates are estimated based on government reg- ulations, laws and terms of individual rebate arrange- ments, historical experience and other relevant factors,  and are recorded as a deduction from revenue at the  time the related revenue is recorded. These estimates  are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience.  There is often a time lag of several months between the  recording of revenue deductions and the final account- ing for them. \nInnovative pay-for-performance arrangements \nWe enter into innovative pay-for-performance arrange- ments (i.e. outcome based arrangements) with certain  healthcare providers and governments. Under these  agreements, we may be required to make refunds, defer  a portion of the sales price until anticipated treatment  outcomes meet predefined targets, or to provide addi- tional medicines free of charge if anticipated treatment  outcomes do not meet predefined targets.  \nThe impact of potential refunds, deferral of a portion  of the sales price, or the delivery of additional medicines  at no cost is estimated and recorded as a deduction from  revenue at the time the related revenues are recorded.  Estimates are based on historical experience and clini- cal data. In cases where historical experience and clini- cal data are not sufficient for a reliable estimation of the  outcome, revenue recognition is deferred until such his- tory is available. \nThese provisions for revenue deductions are adjusted  periodically based on established processes and actual  experience, including the products actual outcomes  achieved compared to the anticipated predefined tar- gets.  \n\nThere is often a time lag of several months between  recording of the revenue deductions and the final  accounting for them. \nNon-healthcare plans and program rebates, returns  and other deductions \nWe offer rebates to purchasing organizations and other  direct and indirect customers to sustain and increase  market share and to ensure patient access to our prod- ucts. Since rebates are contractually agreed upon, the  related provisions are estimated based on the terms of  the individual agreements, historical experience and pro- jected product sales growth rates.  \nChargebacks occur where our subsidiaries have  arrangements with indirect customers to sell products  at prices that are lower than the price charged to whole- salers. A chargeback represents the difference between  the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect cus- tomer’s contract price. We account for chargebacks by  reducing revenue by the estimate of chargebacks attrib- utable to a sales transaction. Provisions for estimated  chargebacks are calculated using a combination of fac- tors, such as historical experience, product growth rates,  product pricing, level of inventory in the distribution chan- nel, and the terms of individual agreements. \nWhen we sell a product providing a customer the right  to return it, we record a provision for estimated sales  returns based on our sales return policy and historical  return rates. Other factors considered include actual  product recalls, expected marketplace changes, the  remaining shelf life of the product, and the expected  entry of generic products. In 2021, sales returns amounted  to approximately  $1\\%$   of gross product sales. If sufficient  experience is not available, sales are only recorded  based on evidence of product consumption or when the  right of return has expired. \nWe enter into distribution service agreements with  major wholesalers, which provide a financial disincentive  for the wholesalers to purchase product quantities in  excess of current customer demand. Where possible,  we adjust shipping patterns for our products to maintain  wholesalers’ inventory levels consistent with underlying  patient demand. \nWe offer cash discounts to customers to encourage  prompt payment. Cash discounts are estimated and  accrued at the time of invoicing and are deducted from  revenue. \nFollowing a decrease in the price of a product, we  generally grant customers a “shelf stock adjustment” for  their existing inventory for the relevant product. Provi- sions for shelf stock adjustments, which are primarily  relevant within the Sandoz Division, are determined at  the time of the price decline or at the point of sale, if the  impact of a price decline on the products sold can be  reasonably estimated based on the customer’s inventory  levels of the relevant product. \nOther sales discounts, such as consumer coupons  and copay discount cards, are offered in some markets.  The estimated amounts of these discounts are recorded  at the time of sale or when the coupons are issued, and  are estimated utilizing historical experience and the spe- cific terms for each program. If a discount for a proba- ble future transaction is offered as part of a sales trans- action, then an appropriate portion of revenue is deferred  to cover this estimated obligation.  "}

Directors, Senior Management and Employees\n\n6.B Compensation\n\nDear shareholder,\n\n| am pleased to share with you the 2021 Compensation\nReport of Novartis AG.\n\n| would like to start by thanking Enrico Vanni for his\nvaluable contribution during his tenure as Chair of the\nCompensation Committee and express my sincerest grat-\nitude for his support and advice since | took over the role.\n\nAt Novartis, our compensation system seeks to\nreward our executives for delivering sustainable growth,\nsuccessful outcomes on our financial and strategic tar-\ngets and value creation for our shareholders. We aim to\nbe transparent in how we link executive compensation\nto performance and have continued to engage with\nshareholders and proxy advisors in this effort.\n\n2021 changes to Executive Committee\ncompensation system and disclosures\n\nThe year completes the first three-year performance\ncycle of the new Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP),\nfollowing the combination of the previous LTPP and the\nLong-Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), as com-\nmunicated in our 2018 Compensation Report. The com-\nbined plan focuses on four equally weighted perfor-\nmance metrics: net sales compound annual growth rate\n(CAGR), core operating income CAGR, innovation, and\nrelative total shareholder return (TSR).\n\nIn 2021, we reviewed our Compensation Report for-\nmat with a view to increase its accessibility while main-\ntaining its depth of disclosure. We chose to develop our\n“—Compensation at a glance” section to incorporate a\nmore graphical illustration of the 2021 CEO pay out-\ncomes and provide a summary of our executive compen-\nsation framework for the year ahead. In addition, we offer\nfurther visibility into the 2019-2021 LTPP targets, show-\ning the threshold, target and maximum opportunity for\neach performance metric.\n\n2021 performance highlights\n2021 was ayear of solid performance, with growth across\nsales, profits, margins and cash flow. Sales growth driv-\ners were Entresto (USD 3.5 billion), Cosentyx (USD 4.7\nbillion), and Zolgensma (USD 1.4 billion), along with ther-\napies like Kesimpta, Promacta/Revolade, Kisqali and\nJakavi. These growth brands, along with other launch\nproducts, represent 52% of Innovative Medicines sales,\nup from 44% in 2020. While overall sales performance\nwas on target, COVID-19 continued to have an impact on\nparts of our business, specifically Oncology and Sandoz.\nWe continued to deliver innovation to patients in 2021\nwith 21 approvals, including Leqvio (US, EU) and Scem-\nblix (US), and 34 submissions made across our top four\nmarkets. However, the year was not without setbacks,\nas some clinical trials of experimental compounds -\nincluding Kymriah for blood cancer, ACZ885 (canaki-\nnumab) for lung cancer, and CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kid-\nney transplant patients - did not meet their primary goals.\n\n90\n\nWe progressed our efforts to deliver next-generation\nmedicines while driving our environmental, social and gov-\nernance (ESG) agenda. Pursuing new health equity initia-\ntivesinclinical trial diversity, advancing access to medicines,\nand using data and digital technologies in underserved\nregions in Africa, South America and Asia are some exam-\nples of our long-term commitment to transforming global\nhealth. More details on our ESG efforts can be found in\nthe Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021.\n\nPerformance against the incentive targets, combined\nwith base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon\nKeep Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted\nin 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of\nCHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of 11.8% compared\nto 2020. Overall, while the financial and operational tar-\ngets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation tar-\ngets were missed, which led to a reduction in long-term\ngrowth potential. This is reflected ina TSR performance\nbelow the peer group median. The reduced contribution\nof innovation and relative TSR to the 2019-2021 LTPP\ncycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized\ncompensation in 2021 versus 2020. (For more informa-\ntion, please see “—LTPP performance outcomes”)\n\n2022 Board compensation and Annual General\nMeeting (AGM)\n\nThe Board is planning to split the Vice Chairman and\nLead Independent Director (LID) roles, and to appoint\nseparate board members to these roles as from the 2022\nAGM. The Board has approved the introduction of an LID\nfee.

We aim to  be transparent in how we link executive compensation  to performance and have continued to engage with  shareholders and proxy advisors in this effort.     \n2021 changes to Executive Committee  compensation system and disclosures \nThe year completes the first three-year performance  cycle of the new Long-Term Performance Plan (LTPP),  following the combination of the previous LTPP and the  Long-Term Relative Performance Plan (LTRPP), as com- municated in our 2018 Compensation Report. The com- bined plan focuses on four equally weighted perfor- mance metrics: net sales compound annual growth rate  (CAGR), core operating income CAGR, innovation, and  relative total shareholder return (TSR).   \nIn 2021, we reviewed our Compensation Report for- mat with a view to increase its accessibility while main- taining its depth of disclosure. We chose to develop our  “—Compensation at a glance” section to incorporate a  more graphical illustration of the 2021 CEO pay out- comes and provide a summary of our executive compen- sation framework for the year ahead. In addition, we offer  further visibility into the 2019-2021 LTPP targets, show- ing the threshold, target and maximum opportunity for  each performance metric. \n2021 performance highlights \n2021 was a year of solid performance, with growth across  sales, profits, margins and cash flow. Sales growth driv- ers were  Entresto  (USD 3.5 billion),  Cosentyx  (USD 4.7  billion), and  Zolgensma  (USD 1.4 billion), along with ther- apies like  Kesimpta ,  Promacta/Revolade ,  Kisqali  and  Jakavi . These growth brands, along with other launch  products, represent  $52\\%$   of Innovative Medicines sales,  up from   $44\\%$   in 2020. While overall sales performance  was on target, COVID-19 continued to have an impact on  parts of our business, specifically Oncology and Sandoz. \nWe continued to deliver innovation to patients in 2021  with 21 approvals, including  Leqvio  (US, EU) and  Scem- blix  (US), and 34 submissions made across our top four  markets. However, the year was not without setbacks,  as some clinical trials of experimental compounds –  including  Kymriah  for blood cancer, ACZ885 (canaki- numab) for lung cancer, and CFZ533 (iscalimab) in kid- ney transplant patients – did not meet their primary goals.   \nWe progressed our efforts to deliver next-generation  medicines while driving our environmental, social and gov- ernance (ESG) agenda. Pursuing new health equity initia- tives  in  clinical  trial  diversity,  advancing  access  to  medicines,  and using data and digital technologies in underserved  regions in Africa, South America and Asia are some exam- ples of our long-term commitment to transforming global  health. More details on our ESG efforts can be found in  the Novartis in Society Integrated Report 2021. \nPerformance against the incentive targets, combined  with base salary and other benefits, pension, Alcon  Keep Whole awards and dividend equivalents, resulted  in 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO of  CHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of   $11.8\\%$   compared  to 2020. Overall, while the financial and operational tar- gets were met or surpassed, some of the innovation tar- gets were missed, which led to a reduction in long-term  growth potential. This is reflected in a TSR performance  below the peer group median. The reduced contribution  of innovation and relative TSR to the 2019-2021 LTPP  cycle were the main drivers of the lower total realized  compensation in 2021 versus 2020. (For more informa- tion, please see “—LTPP performance outcomes”) \n2022 Board compensation and Annual General  Meeting (AGM) \nThe Board is planning to split the Vice Chairman and  Lead Independent Director (LID) roles, and to appoint  separate board members to these roles as from the 2022  AGM. The Board has approved the introduction of an LID  fee. More information can be found in “—2022 Board  compensation” and “—Vice Chairman and Lead Indepen- dent Director” in Item 6.C of this Annual Report. \nIn line with our Articles of Incorporation, we put to a  vote the maximum aggregate amount of compensation  for the Board of Directors from the 2022 AGM to the  2023 AGM, and the maximum aggregate amount of com- pensation for the Executive Committee for the financial  year 2023. We also request your advisory vote on this  Compensation Report. \nWe deeply value our ongoing dialogue with you and  other stakeholders. As always, we welcome your feed- back, which is extremely valuable in driving improve- ments in our compensation system and practices. \nFinally, I would like to acknowledge and thank my fel- low committee members for their diligence and service  during the year.  \nThis image shows a handwritten signature.\nSimon Moroney, D.Phil.

Directors, Senior Management and Employees\n\nExecutive Committee appointments compensation policy\n\nELEMENT OF COMPENSATION POLICY\n\nLevel The overall package should be market-competitive to enable the recruitment of global executive talent with\ndeep expertise and competencies.\n\nAnnual base salary The Compensation Committee may appoint individuals who are new to a role on an annual base salary\nthat is below the market level, with a view to increase this toward market level over a period of three to four\nyears as an individual develops in the role.\n\nThis prudent approach ensures pay levels are merit-based, with increases dependent on strong\nperformance and proven ability in the role over a sustained period.\n\nIncentives The compensation package will normally include the key compensation elements and incentive\nopportunities in line with those offered to current Executive Committee members.\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, higher Long-Term Incentive opportunities than those offered to current\nExecutive Committee members may be provided at the Compensation Committee's discretion.\n\nPerformance measures may include business-specific measures tailored to the specific role.\n\nPension and other benefits Newly appointed Executive Committee members are eligible for the local country pension plan and other\nbenefits in line with the wider employee group.\n\nBuyouts The Compensation Committee seeks to balance the need to offer competitive compensation opportunities\nto acquire the talent required by the business with the principle of maintaining a strong focus on pay for\nperformance.\n\nAs such, when an individual forfeits variable compensation as a result of an appointment at Novartis, the\nCompensation Committee may offer replacement awards in such form as the Compensation Committee\nconsiders appropriate, taking into account relevant factors.\n\nRelevant factors include the replacement vehicle (i.e., cash, restricted share units, restricted shares or\nperformance share units), whether the award is contingent on meeting performance conditions or not, the\nexpected value of the forfeited award, the timing of forfeiture (ie., Novartis mirrors the blocking or vesting\nperiod of the forfeited award) and the leaver conditions, in case the recruited individual leaves Novartis\nprior to the end of the blocking or vesting period.\n\nThe Compensation Committee will seek to pay no more than is required to match the commercial value or\nfair value of payments and awards forfeited by the individual.\n\nInternational mobility If individuals are required to relocate or be assigned away from their home location to take up their position,\nrelocation support may be provided in line with our global mobility policies (i.e., relocation support, tax\nequalization). This includes ongoing US state income tax liabilities on behalf of US citizens locally employed\noutside the US who have US workdays and therefore, US state taxable compensation which generates a\nUS state tax liability.\n\n94\n", "vlm_text": "Executive Committee appointments compensation policy \nThe table outlines different elements of compensation for an executive committee, along with their corresponding policies. Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Level**: \n   - The policy states that the overall compensation package should be market-competitive to attract global executive talent with expertise and competencies.\n\n2. **Annual Base Salary**: \n   - For new roles, the Compensation Committee may offer a salary below market level but aims to increase it to market level over three to four years as the individual develops in their role. This approach ensures merit-based salary increases and recognizes sustained strong performance and proven ability.\n\n3. **Incentives**: \n   - The compensation package typically includes key compensation elements and incentives similar to those offered to current Executive Committee members. Higher Long-Term Incentive opportunities may be provided in exceptional circumstances. Performance measures could include business-specific targets tailored to the role.\n\n4. **Pension and Other Benefits**: \n   - New Executive Committee members are eligible for local country pension plans and other benefits aligned with the wider employee group.\n\n5. **Buyouts**: \n   - The Compensation Committee balances offering competitive compensation opportunities with maintaining a strong pay-for-performance focus. If an individual forfeits variable compensation due to an appointment, replacement awards may be offered. Relevant factors considered include the type of replacement vehicle, performance conditions, value, and timing of forfeiture, and any leaver conditions. The committee aims to match only the commercial fair value of forfeited payments and awards.\n\n6. **International Mobility**: \n   - For executives required to relocate or work away from home, relocation support is provided according to global mobility policies. This includes covering US state income tax liabilities for US citizens employed outside the US who have US workdays and generate US state taxable compensation."}

The percentage of women in\nmanagement increased to 46% in 2021 (from 45% in 2020). In addition to our prior year progress, we achieved pay\ntransparency in a further 10 countries in 2021, including Switzerland and the US bringing the total to 16 countries\nwhere employees can compare their pay to external benchmarks. Additionally, we eliminated historical salary data\nfrom 80% of global hiring to reduce the risk of bias when making job offers. Based on the data available at the\ntime of disclosure, Novartis has a global mean pay gap of +3.3%, compared with 3.6% in the prior year.

Both departed under good leaver conditions.  \nSubsequently, the Board of Directors agreed to shorten the 12-month notice period for both Mr. Bodson and  Mr. Baert to allow them to take on new positions on December 1, 2021, and October 1, 2021, respectively, with com- panies that are not in the Novartis comparator peer group as defined in the applicable variable pay plan rules. Out- standing LTI grants will vest at the end of the relevant performance cycles on a pro-rata basis, per their contrac- tual agreements and in line with the said plan rules. "}

Klaus Moosmayer, John Tsai and Richard Saynor joined Novartis after the 2018 LTI awards being made and hence did not  receive LTPP and LTRPP awards for the 2018-2020 performance period. \n5 \tIncludes 6 128 vested RSUs (CHF 471 666), of which 698 vested on March,13 2020, and 5 430 on July 28, 2020, as well as 4 022 vested PSUs (CHF 281 379) on March 13, 2020, to  John Tsai in lieu of the LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer. Also includes 2 421 vested RSUs (USD 229 487) on January 4, 2020, to James Bradner in lieu of the  LTI that he forfeited when leaving his previous employer and 6 011 vested PSUs (CHF 550 788) on January 17, 2020, to Klaus Moosmayer in lieu of the LTI he forfeited when leaving his  previous employer. Lastly, includes 2 348 vested RSUs (CHF 224 516) and 2 178 vested PSUs (CHF 208 260) on February 15, 2020, to Richard Saynor in lieu of the LTI that he  forfeited when leaving his previous employer. The PSUs had the same performance measures as the LTPP for the 2017-2019 performance cycle (NCVA and long-term innovation). 6 \tAll amounts are before deduction of the social security contribution and income tax due by the Executive Committee member. \n\tAmounts for Executive Committee members paid in USD were converted at a rate of USD   $1.00={\\mathsf{C H F}}\\,0.939$  , which is the same average exchange rate used in the Group’s 2020  consolidated financial statements (similar rule applies in case of payments made in other currencies during the year). \nRealized compensation for the CEO and other Executive Committee members for 2021 compared to 2020 The 2021 total realized compensation for the CEO was CHF 11 224 727. This is a reduction of   $11.8\\%$   compared to  the prior year, mainly due to the lower performance payout of the 2019-2021 LTPP (  $\\cdot107\\%$   compared to the   $126\\%$    combined payout for the 2018-2020 LTPP and LTRPP). During the 2019-2021 LTPP performance cycle, the TSR  ranking for Novartis, which is weighted  $z5\\%$   of the overall LTPP opportunity, was below median, which resulted in  zero payout for this measure. Long-term Innovation performance, also weighted   $\\mathcal{Z}5\\%$  , was also lower (  $109\\%$   com- pared to  $131\\%$   in 2018-2020). For more detail, please refer to “—LTPP performance outcomes.” \nThe 2021 total realized compensation for the Executive Committee members, including the CEO, was CHF 56 639 891.  The small decrease compared to the prior year can be mainly attributed to the lower 2019-2021 LTPP payout com- pared to the 2018-2020 cycle and, to a lesser extent, lower annual incentive payouts on average for Executive  Committee members for 2021 compared to the prior performance year. The lower performance payouts were par- tially offset by vesting of the first LTI for some Executive Committee members, granted to them following their  respective appointments three years ago.  "}

In addition, the  Annual Report is in line with the principles of the Swiss  Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance of the  Swiss Business Federation (economiesuisse). \nRisk management principles \nThe Compensation Committee, with support from its  independent advisor, reviews market trends in compen- sation, and changes in corporate governance rules and  best practices. Together with the Risk Committee, it also  reviews the Novartis compensation systems to ensure  that they do not encourage inappropriate or excessive  risk-taking, and instead encourage behaviors that sup- port sustainable value creation. A summary of the risk  management principles is outlined below. \nRISK MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES \n•\t Rigorous performance  management process, with  approval of targets and  evaluation of performance  for the CEO by the Board of  Directors •\t Balanced mix of short-term  and long-term variable com- pensation elements •\t Values and Behaviors are a  key component of the Annual  Incentive and are embedded in  our culture •\t Clawback and malus principles  apply to all elements of the  variable compensation •\t Performance-vesting Long- Term Incentives only, with  three-year cycles  \n•\t All variable compensation is  capped at  $\\scriptstyle{200\\%}$   of target •\t Contractual notice period of  12 months •\t Post-contractual non-compete  period is limited to a maximum  of 12 months from the end  of employment. Resulting  compensation is limited to the  annual base salary plus the  prior-year Annual Incentive as  per contract, if applicable •\t Good and bad leaver  provisions apply to variable  compensation of leavers •\t No severance payments or  change-of-control clauses •\t Share ownership requirements;  no hedging or pledging of  Novartis share ownership \nExecutive Committee employment contracts provide for  a notice period of up to 12 months and contain no change- of-control clauses or severance provisions (for example,  agreements concerning special notice periods, lon- ger-term contracts, “golden parachutes,” waiver of  lockup periods for equities and bonds, shorter vesting  periods, and additional contributions to occupational  pension schemes). For share ownership requirements,  please refer to “—Share ownership requirements for the  CEO and other Executive Committee members.” \nCompensation decision-making authorities \nAuthority for decisions related to compensation is gov- erned by the Articles of Incorporation, Board Regulations  and the Compensation Committee Charter, which are all  published on the Company website: www.novartis.com/ investors/company-overview/corporate-governance. The  Compensation Committee serves as the supervisory and  governing body for compensation policies and plans within  Novartis, and has overall responsibility for determining,  reviewing and proposing compensation policies and plans  for approval by the Board of Directors in line with the Com- pensation Committee Charter. A summary of discussions  and conclusions of each committee meeting is delivered  to the full Board of Directors. A summary of the compen- sation decision-making authorities is set out below. \n\nCompensation authorization levels within the  parameters set by the shareholders’ meeting \nThe table outlines the decision-making authority for compensation decisions in an organization:\n\n1. **Compensation of Chairman and other Board members** - Decided by the Board of Directors.\n2. **Compensation of CEO** - Decided by the Board of Directors.\n3. **Compensation of other Executive Committee members** - Decided by the Compensation Committee.\nCommittee member independence \nThe Compensation Committee is composed exclusively  of members of the Board of Directors who meet the inde- pendence criteria set forth in the Board Regulations. From  the 2021 AGM, the Compensation Committee had the fol- lowing five members: Simon Moroney (as Chair), Patrice  Bula, Bridgette Heller, Enrico Vanni and William Winters. \nRole of the Compensation Committee’s  independent advisor \nThe Compensation Committee retained Mercer Limited  during the financial year 2021 as its independent external  compensation advisor to support the committee in determin- ing the design and implementation of compensation and ben- efits. The advisor from Mercer Limited was hired directly by  the Compensation Committee in 2017, and the Compensa- tion Committee has been fully satisfied with the performance  and independence of the advisor since its engagement. In  determining whether to renew the engagement with the advi- sor, the Compensation Committee evaluates, at least annu- ally, the quality of the consulting service, the independence  of the advisor, and the benefits of rotating advisors. Mercer  Limited also provides services related to management devel- opment at the mid- and frontline leader level and in respect  of corporate pensions. The independent advisor and his team  that advises and supports the committee are not responsible  or rewarded for work beyond support to the Compensation  Committee and the People & Organization function on senior  compensation.  \nMeetings held in 2021 and self-evaluation \nIn 2021, the Compensation Committee held seven formal  meetings. In line with prior years, it collaborated with the  Science & Technology Committee to review and endorse,  for approval by the Board of Directors, the innovation tar- gets and achievements of the Annual Incentive and LTPP.  The Compensation Committee conducted a self-evaluation  in 2021. "}

Given that shareholder\nrepresentation at General Meetings traditionally has been\nrather low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registra-\ntion restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder\nfrom dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon\nrequest, grant an exemption. Considerations include whether\nthe shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable\nvalue and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions\nare in force for the registered shareholders listed in “—Item\n6.C Board practices—Group structure and shareholders—\nShareholders—Significant shareholders.” Exemptions also\napply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participa-\ntion, Basel, which as of December 31, 2021, was registered\nin the Share Register with less than 2% of the share capital,\nand to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which\nas of December 31, 2021, was not registered but held 2.1%\naccording to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG.\nNo further exemptions were requested in 2021.

We also held virtual  roadshows in 2021 as part of our engagement with North  American, European and Asian investors. \n\nVoting rights, restrictions and  representation \nREGISTRATION \nShareholders have the right to vote and to execute all  other rights as granted under Swiss law and the Articles  of Incorporation (see, in particular, articles 17 and 18 of  the Articles of Incorporation). \nEach share registered with the right to vote by the third  business day before the General Meeting entitles the holder  to one vote at General Meetings. Article 5, paragraph 2 of the  Articles of Incorporation provides that to be registered with  voting rights, a shareholder must declare that he or she acquired  the shares in his or her own name and for his or her own  account. According to article 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of  Incorporation, the Board may register nominees with the right  to vote. The Share Register is an internal, non-public register  subject to statutory confidentiality and data privacy.  \nThe Articles of Incorporation are available at www. novartis.com/investors/company-overview/corpo- rate-governance. \nREGISTRATION RESTRICTIONS \nArticle 5, paragraph 2 of the Articles of Incorporation provides  that no shareholder shall be registered with the right to vote  for more than  ${\\mathcal{Z}}\\%$   of the share capital. Given that shareholder  representation at General Meetings traditionally has been  rather low in Switzerland, Novartis AG considers registra- tion restrictions necessary to prevent a minority shareholder  from dominating a General Meeting. The Board may, upon  request, grant an exemption. Considerations include whether  the shareholder supports our goal of creating sustainable  value and has a long-term investment horizon. Exemptions  are in force for the registered shareholders listed in “—Item  6.C Board practices—Group structure and shareholders— Shareholders—Significant shareholders.” Exemptions also  apply to the Novartis Foundation for Employee Participa- tion, Basel, which as of December 31, 2021, was registered  in the Share Register with less than  ${\\mathcal{Z}}^{\\%}$   of the share capital,  and to Norges Bank (Central Bank of Norway), Oslo, which  as of December 31, 2021, was not registered but held  $z.1\\%$  according to a disclosure notification filed with Novartis AG.  No further exemptions were requested in 2021. The same  restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders.  \nArticle 5, paragraph 3 of the Articles of Incorporation  provides that no nominee shall be registered with the right  to vote for more than   $0.5\\%$   of the registered share capital.  The Board may, upon request, grant an exemption from this  restriction if the nominee discloses the names, addresses  and number of shares of the persons for whose account it  holds  $0.5\\%$   or more of the registered share capital. Exemp- tions are in force for the nominees listed in “—Item 6.C Board  practices—Group structure and shareholders—Sharehold- ers—Significant shareholders,” and for the nominee Citibank,  London, which in 2015 requested an exemption, but as of  December 31, 2021, was not registered in the Share Regis- ter. The same restrictions indirectly apply to ADR holders. "}

The GNCRC then sub- mits a proposal to the full Board, and the Board deter- mines the independence status of each Board member. \nThe image contains four pie charts depicting different aspects of a diversity profile:\n\n1. **Nationality**:\n   - American: 30%\n   - Swiss: 30%\n   - Dutch: 12%\n   - German: 12%\n   - British: 8%\n   - Irish: 4%\n   - New Zealander: 4%\n\n2. **Gender**:\n   - Male: 69%\n   - Female: 31%\n\n3. **Age**:\n   - 55–60: 23%\n   - 61–65: 54%\n   - >65: 23%\n\n4. **Tenure**:\n   - <3 years: 23%\n   - 3–6 years: 31%\n   - 7–9 years: 23%\n   - >9 years: 23%\nBoard skills \nUpon proposal by the GNCRC, the Board has determined  a diverse set of competencies for its members that aligns  with our status as a listed company as well as our busi- ness portfolio, geographic reach and culture. Based on  this set of competencies, our Board members were asked  to identify their most relevant skills highlighted by their  educational background, professional experience and  personal achievements.  \nThe GNCRC assesses the set of competencies as  well as the individual skills annually to ensure that an  appropriate balance of skills, expertise, experience and  diversity is represented on the Board. \nThe image shows a bar chart illustrating the distribution of skills among a board, with several categories:\n\n- **Medicine/Healthcare/R&D**: 54% (7 out of 13)\n- **Leadership/Management**: 85% (11 out of 13)\n- **Finance/Accounting**: 46% (6 out of 13)\n- **Law/Regulatory/Risk Management**: 54% (7 out of 13)\n- **Data/Digital**: 23% (3 out of 13)\n- **Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)**: 46% (6 out of 13)\nTo learn more about our Board members’ biographies  and their individual skills, see “—Item 6.C Board practices— Board of Directors—Members of the Board of Directors.” "}

Every  third year, this process is conducted by an independent  external consultant. This last happened in 2020 with the  consulting firm Egon Zehnder.  \n\nThe image outlines a process involving three main steps for a Board review:\n\n1. **Anonymous survey**:\n   - Each Board member fills out an anonymous survey.\n   - A report identifying key strengths and challenges is produced for the Board and its committees.\n\n2. **Qualitative review**:\n   - Based on the results, the Chairman and committee chairs lead a qualitative review with colleagues and then the entire Board.\n   - The Board, without its Chairman, discusses the Chairman’s performance and provides feedback.\n\n3. **Outcome**:\n   - A self-assessment from November 2021 showed the Board and committees are functioning effectively.\n   - Feedback indicated the Board has an open culture fostering a range of viewpoints.\n   - Key focus areas include Group strategy development, oversight of challenging technology projects, and impact on pricing pressure in the US and Europe.\nTrainings \nOur Board receives regular briefings and trainings on  ethics, risks and compliance, and other relevant topics.

PwC  assumed its existing auditing mandate for Novartis in  1996. Claudia Benz, auditor in charge, began serving in  her role in 2021, and Kris Muller, global relationship part- ner, began serving in her role in 2019. The ACC together  with PwC ensure that these partners are rotated at least  every five years.  \nAuditing fees and additional fees \nThe ACC monitors and preapproves the fees paid to the  external auditor for all audit and non-audit services. It has  developed and approved a policy with clear guidelines  on the engagement of the independent auditor firm. This  policy is designed to help ensure that the independence  of the external auditor is maintained. It limits the scope of  services that the external auditor may provide to the Group,  stipulating certain permissible types of audit-related and  non-audit services, including tax services and other ser- vices that have been preapproved by the ACC. The ACC  preapproves all other services on a case-by-case basis.  \nThe external auditor is required to report periodically  to the ACC about the scope of the services it has pro- vided to the Group and the fees for the services it has  performed to date.

Our business purpose, as stated in\nArticle 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises\nin the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold\ninterests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemis-\ntry, physics, information technology or related areas. We\nmay acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and\nintellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In\npursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sus-\ntainable value.\n\n10.B.2 Directors\n\nAccording to our Articles, the Board of Directors\n\n(“Board”) consists of a minimum of eight and amaximum\n\nof 16 members. The members of the Board (including the\n\nChairman) are elected individually by the General Meet-\n\ning of Shareholders (“General Meeting”) for a one-year\n\nterm of office lasting until completion of the next Annual\n\nGeneral Meeting of Shareholders (“AGM”).\n\n(a) A Board resolution requires the affirmative majority\nof the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations,\na member of our Board (“Director”) may not partici-\npate in decisions and resolutions on matters that\naffect, or reasonably might affect, the Director’s inter-\nests or the interests of a person close to the Direc-\ntor.\n\n(b) Compensation of the Directors is subject to the\napproval of the aggregate amounts of such compen-\nsation by a shareholders’ resolution under the Ordi-\nnance against Excessive Compensation in Public\nCompanies of the Swiss Federal Council.\n\n(c) The Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits\nto Directors.\n\n(d) The Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on\nthe Board for more than 12 years. The Board may,\nunder certain circumstances and if deemed in the\nbest interests of the Company, recommend excep-\ntions to this rule to the General Meeting.\n\n(e) Our Directors are not required to be shareholders at\nthe time of the election by the General Meeting. How-\never, according to our share ownership guidelines,\nthe Chairmanis required to own aminimum of 30 000\nNovartis AG shares, and other Directors are required\nto own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five\nyears after joining the Board, to ensure their interests\nare aligned with those of our shareholders.\n\n10.B.3 Shareholder rights\n\nBecause Novartis AG has only one class of registered\nshares, the following information applies to all sharehold-\ners.\n\n(a) Under the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out\nof balance sheet profits or out of distributable\nreserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the\nBoard may propose that a dividend be paid, we may\nonly pay dividends upon shareholders’ approval at a\nGeneral Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires\nus to accrue general legal reserves under certain cir-\ncumstances so long as these reserves amount toless\nthan 20% of our registered share capital, and Swiss\nlaw and the Articles permit us to accrue additional\nreserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors\nmust confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board\nconforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our\nBoard expects to recommend the payment of a divi-\ndend in respect of each financial year.

Additional Information 10.A Share capital \nNot applicable. \n10.B Memorandum and articles of association \nThe following is a non-exhaustive summary of certain  provisions of our Articles of Incorporation (“Articles”);  our Regulations of the Board, the Board Committees and  the Executive Committee (“Board Regulations”); and  Swiss law, particularly the Swiss Code of Obligations  (“Swiss CO”), and is qualified in its entirety by reference  to the Articles and the Board Regulations, which are an  exhibit to this Form 20‑F, and to Swiss law. \n10.B.1 Company purpose \nNovartis AG is registered in the commercial register of  the canton of Basel‑Stadt, Switzerland, under number  CHE‑103.867.266. Our business purpose, as stated in  Article 2 of the Articles, is to hold interests in enterprises  in the area of healthcare or nutrition. We may also hold  interests in enterprises in the areas of biology, chemis- try, physics, information technology or related areas. We  may acquire, mortgage, liquidate or sell real estate and  intellectual property rights in Switzerland or abroad. In  pursuing our business purpose, we strive to create sus- tainable value. \n10.B.2 Directors \nAccording to our Articles, the Board of Directors  (“Board”) consists of a minimum of eight and a maximum  of 16 members. The members of the Board (including the  Chairman) are elected individually by the General Meet- ing of Shareholders (“General Meeting”) for a one-year  term of office lasting until completion of the next Annual  General Meeting of Shareholders (“AGM”).\n\n \n(a) \t A Board resolution requires the affirmative majority  of the votes cast. According to our Board Regulations,  a member of our Board (“Director”) may not partici- pate in decisions and resolutions on matters that  affect, or reasonably might affect, the Director’s inter- ests or the interests of a person close to the Direc- tor. \n\n (b)\tCompensation of the Directors is subject to the  approval of the aggregate amounts of such compen- sation by a shareholders’ resolution under the Ordi- nance against Excessive Compensation in Public  Companies of the Swiss Federal Council.\n\n (c)\tThe Articles prohibit the granting of loans or credits  to Directors. \n(d)\tThe Articles provide that a Director shall not serve on  the Board for more than 12 years. The Board may,  under certain circumstances and if deemed in the  best interests of the Company, recommend excep- tions to this rule to the General Meeting.  \n\n \n(e)\tOur Directors are not required to be shareholders at  the time of the election by the General Meeting. How- ever, according to our share ownership guidelines,  the Chairman is required to own a minimum of 30 000  Novartis AG shares, and other Directors are required  to own at least 5 000 Novartis AG shares within five  years after joining the Board, to ensure their interests  are aligned with those of our shareholders. \n10.B.3 Shareholder rights \nBecause Novartis AG has only one class of registered  shares, the following information applies to all sharehold- ers. \n(a)\tUnder the Swiss CO, we may only pay dividends out  of balance sheet profits or out of distributable  reserves. In any event, under the Swiss CO, while the  Board may propose that a dividend be paid, we may  only pay dividends upon shareholders’ approval at a  General Meeting. Furthermore, the Swiss CO requires  us to accrue general legal reserves under certain cir- cumstances so long as these reserves amount to less  than  $\\mathcal{Z}0\\%$   of our registered share capital, and Swiss  law and the Articles permit us to accrue additional  reserves beyond the statutory reserves. Our auditors  must confirm that the dividend proposal of our Board  conforms with the Swiss CO and the Articles. Our  Board expects to recommend the payment of a divi- dend in respect of each financial year. See “Item 6.  Directors, Senior Management and Employees—Item  6.C Board Practices—Capital Structure—Limitation  on transferability—Per-share information” and  “Item  8.  Financial Information—Item  8.A. Consoli- dated statements and other financial information— Dividend policy.” \nDividends are usually due and payable shortly after  the shareholders have passed a resolution approving  the payment. Dividends that have not been claimed  within five years after the due date revert to us and are  allocated to our general reserves. For information  about deduction of the withholding tax or other duties  from dividend payments, see “—Item 10.E Taxation.” "}

The aggregate\nnominal value of all Novartis AG shares held by us and\nour subsidiaries may not exceed 10% of our regis-\ntered share capital. However, it is accepted that a\nSwiss corporation may repurchase its own shares\nbeyond the statutory limit of 10% if the repurchased\nshares are clearly earmarked for cancellation.

In addition\nto this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a\nmember of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock\nexchange levy.\n\nUS federal income taxation\n\nThe following is a general discussion of the material US\nfederal income tax consequences of the ownership and\ndisposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant\nto you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because\nthis discussion does not consider any specific circum-\nstances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs,\npersons who are subject to US taxation are strongly\nurged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall\nUS federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as\nto the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences,\nof the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs.\nIn particular, additional or different rules may apply to US\nexpatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regu-\nlated investment companies; traders in securities who\nelect to apply a mark-to-market method of accounting;\ndealers in securities or currencies; tax-exempt entities;\ninsurance companies; broker-dealers; investors liable for\nalternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or\nADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion trans-\naction; holders whose functional currency is not the US\ndollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; per-\nsons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise\nof employee stock options or otherwise as compensa-\ntion; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attri-\nbution, 10% or more of our outstanding shares. This dis-\ncussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold\nthe shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for\ninvestment purposes), and whose functional currency is\nthe US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own\ntax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for\nbenefits under the Treaty.\n\nFor purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is aben-\neficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individ-\nual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal\nincome tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity\ntaxable as a corporation for US federal income tax pur-\nposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the\nUS or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an\nestate the income of which is subject to US federal\nincome taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust\n(i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and\n\nthe control of one or more US persons, or (ii) that has a\nvalid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a\npartnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for\nUS federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs,\nthe tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon\nthe status of the partner and the activities of the part-\nnership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or\nADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regard-\ning the specific tax consequences of the owning and\ndisposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership.\n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of\nADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner\nof our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see\nthe discussion below under “—Dividends’ regarding cer-\ntain statements made by the US Treasury concerning\ndepositary arrangements.\n\nThis discussion assumes that each obligation in the\nDeposit Agreement and any related agreement will be\nperformed in accordance with its terms.\n\nDividends. US Holders will be required to include in gross\nincome, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount\n(without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the divi-\ndend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time\nthat such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the\ncase of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs.\nFor this purpose, a “dividend” will include any distribu-\ntion paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other\nthan certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock)\npaid out of our current or accumulated earnings and prof-\nits, as determined under US federal income tax princi-\nples. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us\nexceeds our current and accumulated earnings and prof-\nits, such excess will first be treated as a tax-free return\nof capital to the extent of a US Holder’s tax basis in the\nshares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such\ntax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain,\nwhich will be long-term capital gain if the US Holder held\nour shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the\nCode, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs\nare not eligible for the dividends received deduction gen-\nerally allowed to corporate shareholders.\n\nDividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs\nwill constitute income from sources outside the US for\nUS foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations\nand conditions provided in the Code, US Holders gener-\nally may claim as acredit against their US federal income\ntax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend.\nThe rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex.\nEach US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor\nconcerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax\ncredit will be available with respect to dividends received\nfrom us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the With-\nholding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within\nwhich the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided\na deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes\nthe US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year.

The sale of  shares, whether by Swiss residents or Non‑Resident  Holders, may be subject to federal securities transfer  Stamp Duty of   $0.15\\%$  , calculated on the sale proceeds,  if the sale occurs through or with a Swiss bank or other  Swiss securities dealer, as defined in the Swiss Federal  Stamp Duty Act. The Stamp Duty has to be paid by the  securities dealer and may be charged to the parties in a  taxable transaction who are not securities dealers.  Stamp Duty may also be due if a sale of shares occurs  with or through a non‑Swiss bank or securities dealer,  provided that (i) such bank or dealer is a member of the  SIX, and (ii) the sale takes place on the SIX. In addition  to this Stamp Duty, the sale of shares by or through a  member of the SIX may be subject to a minor stock  exchange levy. \nUS federal income taxation \nThe following is a general discussion of the material US  federal income tax consequences of the ownership and  disposition of our shares or ADRs that may be relevant  to you if you are a US Holder (as defined below). Because  this discussion does not consider any specific circum- stances of any particular holder of our shares or ADRs,  persons who are subject to US taxation are strongly  urged to consult their own tax advisors as to the overall  US federal, state and local tax consequences, as well as  to the overall Swiss and other foreign tax consequences,  of the ownership and disposition of our shares or ADRs.  In particular, additional or different rules may apply to US  expatriates; banks and other financial institutions; regu- lated investment companies; traders in securities who  elect to apply a mark‑to‑market method of accounting;  dealers in securities or currencies; tax‑exempt entities;  insurance companies; broker‑dealers; investors liable for  alternative minimum tax; investors that hold shares or  ADRs as part of a straddle, hedging or conversion trans- action; holders whose functional currency is not the US  dollar; partnerships or other pass-through entities; per- sons who acquired our shares pursuant to the exercise  of employee stock options or otherwise as compensa- tion; and persons who hold, directly, indirectly or by attri- bution,  $10\\%$   or more of our outstanding shares. This dis- cussion generally applies only to US Holders who hold  the shares or ADRs as a capital asset (generally, for  investment purposes), and whose functional currency is  the US dollar. Investors are urged to consult their own  tax advisors concerning whether they are eligible for  benefits under the Treaty. \nFor purposes of this discussion, a US Holder is a ben- eficial owner of our shares or ADRs who is (i) an individ- ual who is a citizen or resident of the US for US federal  income tax purposes; (ii) a corporation (or other entity  taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax pur- poses) created or organized in or under the laws of the  US or a state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an  estate the income of which is subject to US federal  income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust  (i) subject to the primary supervision of a US court and  the control of one or more US persons, or (ii) that has a  valid election in place to be treated as a US person. If a  partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for  US federal income tax purposes) holds shares or ADRs,  the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon  the status of the partner and the activities of the part- nership. Partners in a partnership that holds shares or  ADRs are urged to consult their own tax advisor regard- ing the specific tax consequences of the owning and  disposing of such shares or ADRs by the partnership. \n\nFor US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder of  ADRs generally will be treated as the beneficial owner  of our shares represented by the ADRs. However, see  the discussion below under “—Dividends” regarding cer- tain statements made by the US Treasury concerning  depositary arrangements. \nThis discussion assumes that each obligation in the  Deposit Agreement and any related agreement will be  performed in accordance with its terms. \nDividends.   US Holders will be required to include in gross  income, as an item of ordinary income, the full amount  (without reduction for any Withholding Tax) of the divi- dend paid with respect to our shares or ADRs at the time  that such dividend is received by the US Holder, in the  case of shares, or by the depositary, in the case of ADRs.  For this purpose, a “dividend” will include any distribu- tion paid by us with respect to our shares or ADRs (other  than certain pro rata distributions of our capital stock)  paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and prof- its, as determined under US federal income tax princi- ples. To the extent the amount of a distribution by us  exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and prof- its, such excess will first be treated as a tax‑free return  of capital to the extent of a US Holder’s tax basis in the  shares or ADRs (with a corresponding reduction in such  tax basis), and thereafter will be treated as capital gain,  which will be long‑term capital gain if the US Holder held  our shares or ADRs for more than one year. Under the  Code, dividend payments by us on the shares or ADRs  are not eligible for the dividends received deduction gen- erally allowed to corporate shareholders. \nDividend income in respect of our shares or ADRs  will constitute income from sources outside the US for  US foreign tax credit purposes. Subject to the limitations  and conditions provided in the Code, US Holders gener- ally may claim as a credit against their US federal income  tax liability, any Withholding Tax withheld from a dividend.  The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex.  Each US Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor  concerning whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax  credit will be available with respect to dividends received  from us. Alternatively, a US Holder may claim the With- holding Tax as a deduction for the taxable year within  which the Withholding Tax is paid or accrued, provided  a deduction is claimed for all of the foreign income taxes  the US Holder pays or accrues in the particular year. A  deduction does not reduce US tax on a dollar‑for‑dollar  basis like a tax credit. The deduction, however, is not  subject to the limitations applicable to foreign tax cred- its, but may be subject to other limitations, and each US  Holder is urged to consult its own tax advisor. \nThe US Treasury has expressed concern that parties  to whom ADRs are released may be taking actions incon- sistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits for US  Holders of ADRs. Accordingly, the summary above of the  creditability of the Withholding Tax could be affected by  future actions that may be taken by the US Treasury. "}

Accordingly, the summary above of the\ncreditability of the Withholding Tax could be affected by\nfuture actions that may be taken by the US Treasury.\n\nIn general, a US Holder will be required to determine\nthe amount of any dividend paid in Swiss francs, includ-\ning the amount of any Withholding Tax imposed thereon,\nby translating the Swiss francs into US dollars at the spot\nrate on the date the dividend is actually or constructively\nreceived by a US Holder, in the case of shares, or by the\ndepositary, in the case of ADRs, regardless of whether\nthe Swiss francs are in fact converted into US dollars. If\na US Holder converts the Swiss francs so received into\nUS dollars on the date of receipt, the US Holder gener-\nally should not recognize foreign currency gain or loss\non such conversion. If a US Holder does not convert the\nSwiss francs so received into US dollars on the date of\nreceipt, the US Holder will have a tax basis in the Swiss\nfrancs equal to the US dollar value on such date. Any for-\neign currency gain or loss that a US Holder recognizes\non a subsequent conversion or other disposition of the\nSwiss francs generally will be treated as US source ordi-\nnary income or loss.\n\nFor anon-corporate US Holder, the US dollar amount\nof any dividends paid that constitute qualified dividend\nincome generally will be taxable at a maximum rate of\n15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers with annual income\nthat exceeds certain thresholds), provided that the US\nHolder meets certain holding period and other require-\nments. In addition, the dividends could be subject to a\n3.8% net investment income tax. This tax is applied\nagainst the lesser of the US Holder’s net investment\nincome or the amount by which modified adjusted gross\nincome exceeds a statutory threshold amount based on\nfiling status. We currently believe that dividends paid with\nrespect to our shares and ADRs will constitute qualified\ndividend income for US federal income tax purposes,\nprovided that the US Holder meets certain holding period\nand other requirements.

Upon a sale or other\ntaxable disposition of shares or ADRs, US Holders gen-\n\nerally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount\nequal to the difference between the US dollar value of\nthe amount realized on the disposition and the US Hold-\ner’s tax basis (determined in US dollars) in the shares or\nADRs. This capital gain or loss generally will be US\nsource gain or loss and will be treated as long-term cap-\nital gain or loss if the holding period in the shares or ADRs\nexceeds one year. In the case of a non-corporate US\nHolder, any long-term capital gain generally will be sub-\nject to US federal income tax at preferential rates, with\namaximum rate of 15% (or 20% in the case of taxpayers\nwith annual income that exceeds certain thresholds). In\naddition, the gains could be subject to a3.8% investment\nincome tax. This tax is applied against the lesser of the\nUS Holder’s net investment income or the amount by\nwhich modified adjusted gross income exceeds a stat-\nutory threshold amount based on filing status.

Controls and Procedures \nReport of Novartis Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nNovartis AG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Finan‑ cial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our dis‑ closure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange  Act Rule 13a‑15(e)) as of the end of the period covered  by this Annual Report, have concluded that, as of such  date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effec‑ tive. \nThe Board of Directors and management of the  Group are responsible for establishing and maintaining  adequate internal control over financial reporting. The  Group’s internal control system was designed to provide  reasonable assurance to the Group’s management and  Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of its  published consolidated financial statements. \nAll internal control systems, no matter how well  designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even  those systems determined to be effective may not pre‑ vent or detect misstatements and can provide only rea‑ sonable assurance with respect to financial statement  preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any  evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject  to the risk that controls may become inadequate because  of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compli‑ ance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \nGroup management assessed the effectiveness of  the Group’s internal control over financial reporting as  of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, it used  the criteria established in  Internal Control—Integrated  Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsor‑ ing Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on our assessment, management concluded that,  as of December 31, 2021, the Group’s internal control  over financial reporting is effective based on those cri‑ teria. \nPrice waterhouse Coopers AG, Switzerland, an inde‑ pendent registered public accounting firm, has issued  an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s  internal control over financial reporting, which is included  in this Annual Report under “Item 18.

Consolidated entities are also  referred to as “subsidiaries.”  \nIn cases where Novartis does not fully own a subsid- iary, it has elected to value any remaining outstanding  non-controlling interest at the time of acquiring control  of the subsidiary at its proportionate share of the fair  value of the net identified assets. \nInvestments in associated companies (generally  defined as investments in entities in which Novartis holds  between  $\\mathcal{Z}0\\%$   and  $50\\%$   of voting shares or over which it  otherwise has significant influence) and joint ventures  are accounted for using the equity method, except for  selected venture fund investments for which the Group  has elected to apply the method of fair value through the  consolidated income statement. \nForeign currencies \nThe consolidated financial statements of Novartis are  presented in US dollars (USD). The functional currency  of a subsidiary is generally the local currency of that  respective entity. The functional currency used for the  reporting of certain Swiss and foreign finance entities is  USD instead of their respective local currencies.

The subsequent gains or losses resulting from  the restatement of non-monetary assets are recorded  in “Other financial income and expense” in the consoli- dated income statement.  \nNon-current assets held for sale or  held for distribution to owners \nNon-current assets are accounted for as assets held for  sale or as related to discontinued operations when their  carrying amount is to be recovered principally through  a sale transaction or distribution to owners and a sale or  distribution to owners is considered highly probable.

The fair value of the total purchase consideration was  USD 3.7 billion. The amount consisted of an initial cash  \npayment of USD 3.5 billion, and the fair value of the con- tingent consideration of USD 0.2 billion, which Takeda  is eligible to receive upon the achievement of specified  commercialization milestones. \nThe purchase price allocation resulted in net identi- fiable assets of approximately USD 3.6 billion, consist- ing mainly of intangible assets of USD 3.6 billion, and  goodwill amounted to approximately USD 0.1 billion. In  2019, from the date of acquisition, the business gener- ated net sales of USD 0.2 billion. Management estimated  that net sales for the entire year of 2019 would have  amounted to USD 0.3 billion, had the business been  acquired at the beginning of the 2019 reporting period.  The 2019 results of operations since the date of  acquisition were not material. \n3. Segmentation of key figures 2021, 2020 and 2019 \nThe businesses of Novartis are divided operationally on  a worldwide basis into two identified reporting segments:  Innovative Medicines and Sandoz. In addition, we sepa- rately report Corporate activities. \nReporting segments are presented in a manner con- sistent with the internal reporting to the chief operating  decision-maker, which is the Executive Committee of  Novartis. The reporting segments are ­ managed sepa- rately because they each research, develop, manufac- ture, distribute and sell distinct products that require dif- fering marketing strategies.  \nThe Executive Committee of Novartis is responsible  for allocating resources and assessing the performance  of the reporting segments. \nThe reporting segments are as follows: \nInnovative Medicines researches, develops, manu- factures, distributes and sells patented prescription  medicines. The Innovative Medicines Division is orga- nized into two global business units: Novartis Oncology  and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Novartis Oncology con- sists of the global business franchises Hematology and  Solid Tumor, and Novartis Pharmaceuticals consists of  the global business franchises Immunology, Hepatology  and Dermatology; Neuroscience; Ophthalmology; Car- diovascular, Renal and Metabolism; Respiratory and  Allergy; and Established Medicines. \n\nSandoz develops, manufactures and markets finished  dosage form medicines as well as intermediary products  including active pharmaceutical ingredients. Sandoz is  organized globally into three franchises: Retail Generics,  Anti-Infectives and Bio pharmaceuticals. In Retail Gener- ics, Sandoz develops, manufactures and markets active  ingredients and finished dosage forms of small molecule  pharmaceuticals to third parties across a broad range  of therapeutic areas, as well as finished dosage form of  anti-infectives sold to third parties. In Anti-Infectives,  Sandoz manufactures and supplies active pharmaceuti- cal ingredients and intermediates, mainly antibiotics, for  internal use by Retail Generics and for sale to third-party  customers. In Bio pharmaceuticals, Sandoz develops,  manufactures and markets protein- or other biotechnol- ogy-based products, including biosimilars, and provides  biotechnology manufacturing services to other compa- nies.  \nIncome and expenses relating to Corporate include  the costs of the Group headquarters and those of cor- porate coordination functions in major countries. In addi- tion, Corporate includes other items of income and  expense that are not attributable to specific segments,  such as certain revenues from intellectual property  rights, certain expenses related to post-employment  benefits, environmental remediation liabilities, charitable  activities, donations and sponsorships. Usually, no allo- cation of Corporate items is made to the segments. As  a result, Corporate assets and liabilities principally con- sist of net debt (cash and cash equivalents, marketable  securities less financial debts), investments in associ- ated companies, and current and deferred taxes and  non-segment-specific environmental remediation and  post-employment benefit liabilities.

This change  impacted the Group’s Basel-Stadt-domiciled operating  subsidiaries.  \nThe Swiss federal tax reform was approved by vot- ers in May 2019. The enactment of the Swiss federal tax  reform required the abolishment of the holding company  tax regimes as of January 1, 2020. As a result, the hold- ing company tax rate increased from the current  $8\\%$   to   $13\\%$  , effective January 1, 2020.  \nThe enactment of these Swiss tax reforms required  a revaluation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities to  the newly enacted tax rates at the date of enactment.  \nThe following table shows the impact on the revalu- ation of deferred assets and liabilities in 2019, as at the  respective dates of the enactment of the Swiss tax  reforms: \nThe table presents the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities in USD millions. There are three main rows:\n\n1. **Deferred tax asset and liability revaluation:**\n   - Items previously recognized in the consolidated income statement: 234 (affecting both equity and the total column with 234 each).\n   - Items previously recognized in other comprehensive income: -358 (affecting both equity and the total column with -358 each).\n\n2. **Total revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities:**\n   - Income statement continuing operations: 234\n   - Equity: -358\n   - Total: -124"}

Reversals of inventory provisions are adjustments where previously recognized provisions are partially or fully reversed.\nThe reversals mainly result from the release of products  initially requiring additional quality control inspections  and from the reassessment of inventory values manu- factured prior to regulatory approval but for which  approval was subsequently received. \nThis table provides data on trade receivables in USD millions for the years 2021 and 2020.

In 2020, Sandoz\nInc. reached aresolution with the DOJ Antitrust Division,\npursuant to which Sandoz Inc. paid USD 195 million and\nentered into a deferred prosecution agreement. The\nSandoz Inc. resolution related to instances of miscon-\nduct at the company between 2013 and 2015 with regard\nto certain generic drugs sold in the United States. Under\nthe terms of that agreement, Sandoz Inc. will continue\nto take steps to enhance its compliance program,\nemployee training and monitoring, and will continue to\ncooperate with the US government’s ongoing investiga-\ntion into the generic pharmaceutical industry. Sandoz\nInc. also finalized a resolution with the DOJ Civil Division\nand in 2021 paid USD 185 million plus interest from the\ndate of the agreement in principle, to settle related claims\narising under the FCA, and entered into a corporate\nintegrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General\n(OIG) of the US Department of Health and Human Ser-\nvices (HHS). This resolution with the DOJ resolves all\nfederal government matters related to price fixing alle-\ngations.\n\nSince the third quarter of 2016, Sandoz Inc. and Foug-\nera Pharmaceuticals Inc. have been sued alongside other\ngeneric pharmaceutical companies in numerous individ-\nual and putative class action complaints by direct and\nindirect private purchasers and by 54 US states and ter-\nritories, represented by their respective Attorneys Gen-\neral. Plaintiffs claim that defendants, including Sandoz\nInc., engaged in price fixing and market allocation of\ngeneric drugs in the United States, and seek damages\nand injunctive relief. The litigation includes complaints\nalleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as com-\nplaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry\nconspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penal-\nties under federal and state antitrust and consumer pro-\ntection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pre-\ntrial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC)\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims\nare being vigorously contested.\n\nLucentis/Avastin’ matters\n\nIn connection with an investigation into whether Novartis\nentities, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and\nRoche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market\npositions of Avastin® and Lucentis, in 2014 the Italian\nCompetition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent\nto USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid\nthe fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment,\nand appealed before the Consiglio di Stato (CdS). In 2014\nand 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombar-\ndia region sent letters with payment requests for a total\n\nequivalent of approximately USD 1.3 billion in damages\nfrom Novartis and Roche entities based on these allega-\ntions. In 2019, the CdS upheld the ICA decision and fine.\nFollowing that CdS decision, several additional Italian\nregions and hospitals sent letters claiming damages for\nan aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million.\nNone of these claims have been asserted in legal pro-\nceedings and no further letters have been sent since.\nNovartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019,\nthe French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a State-\nment of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging\nanti-competitive practices on the French market for\nanti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for\nwet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to\n2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the\nNovartis entities had infringed competition law by abus-\ning a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent\nto approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine,\nagain subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA’s\ndecision. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all\nclaims in Italy and France. Novartis is also challenging\npolicies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed\nuse and reimbursement for economic reasons in various\ncountries, including Italy and Turkey.\n\nSouth Korea investigation\n\nIn 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated\na criminal investigation into, among other things, allega-\ntions that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to pro-\nvide inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare pro-\nfessionals (HCPs). This resulted in a non-material fine,\nwhich the prosecutor appealed. In 2021, the appellate\ncourt upheld the fine, and the prosecutor has appealed\nthat decision.\n\nGreece investigation\n\nNovartis is providing information to the Greek authorities\ninvestigating allegations of potentially inappropriate eco-\nnomic benefits to HCPs, government officials and others\nin Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordi-\nnating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek\nBody of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from\nwhich the Company received a summons in 2018 and\n2020. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine\nequivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million, which\nNovartis Hellas has appealed.\n\n340B Drug Pricing Program investigation\n\nIn 2021, NPC received acivil investigative subpoena from\nthe Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ver-\nmont. The subpoena requested the production of docu-\nments and information concerning NPC’s participation\nin the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC pro-\nvided documents and information to the Office of the\nAttorney General. Also in 2021, NPC received a notifica-\ntion from the US Health Resources and Services Admin-\nistration (HRSA) stating that HRSA believes NPC’s con-\ntract pharmacy policy, which was revised in 2020 to\nestablish a geographic limitation on contract pharmacy\neligibility, but maintained eligibility for pharmacies\nlocated within a 40-mile radius of the parent 340B hos-\npital, violates the 340B statute.

This resolution with the DOJ resolves all  federal government matters related to price fixing alle- gations. \nSince the third quarter of 2016, Sandoz Inc. and Foug- era Pharmaceuticals Inc. have been sued alongside other  generic pharmaceutical companies in numerous individ- ual and putative class action complaints by direct and  indirect private purchasers and by 54 US states and ter- ritories, represented by their respective Attorneys Gen- eral. Plaintiffs claim that defendants, including Sandoz  Inc., engaged in price fixing and market allocation of  generic drugs in the United States, and seek damages  and injunctive relief. The litigation includes complaints  alleging product-specific conspiracies, as well as com- plaints alleging the existence of an overarching industry  conspiracy, and assert claims for damages and penal- ties under federal and state antitrust and consumer pro- tection acts. The cases have been consolidated for pre- trial purposes in the United States District Court (USDC)  for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the claims  are being vigorously contested. \nLucentis/Avastin ®  matters \nIn connection with an investigation into whether Novartis  entities, F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG, Genentech Inc. and  Roche S.p.A. colluded to artificially preserve the market  positions of Avastin ®  and  Lucentis , in 2014 the Italian  Competition Authority (ICA) imposed a fine equivalent  to USD 125 million on the Novartis entities. Novartis paid  the fine, subject to the right to later claim recoupment,  and appealed before the Consiglio di Stato (CdS). In 2014  and 2015, the Italian Ministry of Health and the Lombar- dia region sent letters with payment requests for a total  equivalent of approximately USD 1.3 billion in damages  from Novartis and Roche entities based on these allega- tions. In 2019, the CdS upheld the ICA decision and fine.  Following that CdS decision, several additional Italian  regions and hospitals sent letters claiming damages for  an aggregate amount of approximately USD 330 million.  None of these claims have been asserted in legal pro- ceedings and no further letters have been sent since.  Novartis continues to appeal the CdS decision. In 2019,  the French Competition Authority (FCA) issued a State- ment of Objections against Novartis entities, alleging  anti-competitive practices on the French market for  anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatments for  wet age-related macular degeneration from 2008 to  2013. In 2020, the FCA issued a decision finding that the  Novartis entities had infringed competition law by abus- ing a dominant position and imposing a fine equivalent  to approximately USD 452 million. Novartis paid the fine,  again subject to recoupment, and is appealing the FCA’s  decision. Novartis continues to vigorously contest all  claims in Italy and France. Novartis is also challenging  policies and regulations allowing off-label/unlicensed  use and reimbursement for economic reasons in various  countries, including Italy and Turkey. \n\nSouth Korea investigation \nIn 2016, the Seoul Western District Prosecutor initiated  a criminal investigation into, among other things, allega- tions that Novartis Korea utilized medical journals to pro- vide inappropriate economic benefits to healthcare pro- fessionals (HCPs). This resulted in a non-material fine,  which the prosecutor appealed. In 2021, the appellate  court upheld the fine, and the prosecutor has appealed  that decision.  \nGreece investigation \nNovartis is providing information to the Greek authorities  investigating allegations of potentially inappropriate eco- nomic benefits to HCPs, government officials and others  in Greece. These authorities include the Greek Coordi- nating Body for Inspection and Control, and the Greek  Body of Prosecution of Financial Crime (SDOE), from  which the Company received a summons in 2018 and  2020. In 2021, SDOE imposed on Novartis Hellas a fine  equivalent to approximately USD 1.2 million, which  Novartis Hellas has appealed.  \n340B Drug Pricing Program investigation \nIn 2021, NPC received a civil investigative subpoena from  the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ver- mont. The subpoena requested the production of docu- ments and information concerning NPC’s participation  in the 340B Drug Pricing Program in Vermont. NPC pro- vided documents and information to the Office of the  Attorney General. Also in 2021, NPC received a notifica- tion from the US Health Resources and Services Admin- istration (HRSA) stating that HRSA believes NPC’s con- tract pharmacy policy, which was revised in 2020 to  establish a geographic limitation on contract pharmacy  eligibility, but maintained eligibility for pharmacies  located within a 40-mile radius of the parent 340B hos- pital, violates the 340B statute. HRSA also threatened  an enforcement action. NPC believes its policy is con- sistent with the 340B program’s original intent to sup- port vulnerable patients. Accordingly, NPC sued HRSA  in the USDC for the District of Columbia to challenge  HRSA’s determination and to enjoin HRSA from taking  action with respect to NPC’s contract pharmacy policy.  HRSA then referred the matter regarding NPC’s contract  pharmacy policy to OIG, which could result in the impo- sition of civil monetary penalties on NPC. In November  2021, the USDC issued a decision rejecting HRSA’s inter- pretation of the 340B statute, vacated the violation noti- fication and remanded the matter to HRSA. HRSA has  filed an appeal.

It begins with the total provisions at the start of the year (January 1) for each year. It then details changes in those provisions due to various factors:\n\n- Provisions related to discontinued operations, with an amount of 42 USD million in 2020.\n- Impact of acquisitions of businesses, showing small amounts added in 2020 and 2021.\n- Cash payments made, which substantially increased in 2020 compared to the other years.\n- Releases of provisions, showing how much was released in each year.\n- Additions to provisions, displaying amounts added over the three years with notable increases in 2020 and 2019.\n- Currency translation effects impacting the provisions in each year.\n\nEach year's provisions at the end (December 31) are calculated, with a further breakdown of the non-current portion (those not due within the next year). The non-current portion is highlighted in the last row for each year. The final row shows the non-current product liabilities, governmental investigations, and other legal matters provisions as of December 31 for each year.\nNovartis believes that its total provisions for investiga- tions, product liability, arbitration and other legal matters  are adequate based upon currently available information.  However, given the inherent difficulties in estimating lia- bilities, there can be no assurance that additional liabil- ities and costs will not be incurred beyond the amounts  provided. \n21. Current financial debt  and derivative financial instruments \nThe table presents data on various financial liabilities and instruments for the years 2021 and 2020, measured in USD millions. Here's a breakdown of the items listed in the table:\n\n1. **Interest-bearing accounts of employees payable on demand:**\n   - 2021: 1,814 million USD\n   - 2020: 2,085 million USD\n\n2. **Bank and other financial debt:**\n   - 2021: 899 million USD\n   - 2020: 976 million USD\n\n3. **Commercial paper:**\n   - 2021: 893 million USD\n   - 2020: 4,258 million USD\n\n4. **Current portion of non-current financial debt:**\n   - 2021: 2,621 million USD\n   - 2020: 2,272 million USD\n\n5. **Derivative financial instruments:**\n   - 2021: 68 million USD\n   - 2020: 194 million USD\n\nThe table concludes with a total figure for current financial debt and derivative financial instruments:\n- Total for 2021: 6,295 million USD\n- Total for 2020: 9,785 million USD\n\nThis data likely reflects differences in financial strategy, cash management, or market conditions between the two years.\nThe consolidated balance sheet amounts of current  financial debt, other than the current portion of non-­ current financial debt, approximate the estimated fair  value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. Details on commercial papers and short-term bor- rowings are provided under “Liquidity risk” in Note 29.  "}

This\nrate is based on yields of high-quality corporate bonds\nin the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond\nyields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO\nincreases and the funded status decreases.\n\nIn Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower\ndiscount rates is slightly offset by lower future benefits\nexpected to be paid on the employee’s savings account\nwhere the assumption on interest accrued changes in\nline with the discount rate.\n\nThe impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan’s\nassets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of\nthe plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually\nrise when interest rates decrease and may therefore par-\ntially compensate for the decrease in the funded status.\nFurthermore, pension assets also include significant\nholdings of equity instruments.

The assumptions include:\n\n1. Discount rate: \n   - Pension plans: 0.9% (2021), 0.6% (2020), 1.0% (2019)\n   - Other post-employment benefit plans: 3.3% (2021), 2.9% (2020), 3.6% (2019)\n\n2. Expected rate of pension increase: \n   - Pension plans: 0.5% (2021), 0.3% (2020), 0.3% (2019)\n   - There is no data for other post-employment benefit plans.\n\n3. Expected rate of salary increase: \n   - Pension plans: 2.7% (2021), 2.7% (2020), 2.8% (2019)\n   - There is no data for other post-employment benefit plans.\n\n4. Interest on savings account: \n   - Pension plans: 0.5% (2021), 0.1% (2020), 0.3% (2019)\n   - There is no data for other post-employment benefit plans.\n\n5. Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old male in years:\n   - Pension plans: 22 years (2021, 2020, and 2019)\n   - Other post-employment benefit plans: 21 years (2021, 2020, and 2019)\n\n6. Current average life expectancy for a 65-year-old female in years:\n   - Pension plans: 24 years (2021, 2020, and 2019)\n   - Other post-employment benefit plans: 23 years (2021, 2020, and 2019)\nChanges in the aforementioned actuarial assumptions  can result in significant volatility in the accounting for the  Group’s pension plans in the consolidated financial state- ments. This can result in substantial changes in the  Group’s other comprehensive income, long-term liabili- ties and prepaid ­ pension assets. \nThe DBO is significantly impacted by assumptions  regarding the rate that is used to discount the actuari- ally determined post-employment benefit liability. This  rate is based on yields of high-quality ­ corporate bonds  in the country of the plan. Decreasing corporate bond  yields decrease the discount rate, so that the DBO  increases and the funded status decreases. \nIn Switzerland, an increase in the DBO due to lower  discount rates is slightly offset by lower future benefits  expected to be paid on the employee’s savings account  where the assumption on interest accrued changes in  line with the ­ discount rate. \nThe impact of decreasing interest rates on a plan’s  assets is more difficult to predict. A significant part of  the plan assets is invested in bonds. Bond values usually  rise when interest rates decrease and may therefore par- tially compensate for the decrease in the funded status.  Furthermore, pension assets also include significant  holdings of equity instruments. Share prices tend to rise  when interest rates decrease and therefore often coun- teract the negative impact of the rising defined benefit  obligation on the funded status (although the correlation  of interest rates with equities is not as strong as with  bonds, especially in the short term).

Executive Committee members and NTLs are not  eligible to participate in the equity plan “Select.” \nThe equity plan “Select” currently allows participants  in Switzerland to choose the form of their equity com- pensation in RSs or RSUs. In all other jurisdictions, RSs  or RSUs are granted unilaterally. Until 2013, participants  could also choose to receive part or the entire grant in  the form of tradable share options. \nTradable share options expire on their   $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$   anniver- sary from the grant date. Each tradable share option enti- tles the holder to purchase after vesting (and before the   $10^{\\mathrm{th}}$   anniversary from the grant date) one Novartis share  at a stated exercise price that equals the closing market  price of the underlying share at the grant date. As the  exercise price does not reflect the decrease in the  Novartis share due to the Alcon spin, one-fifth of an Alcon  share will also be awarded to the option holder upon  exercise. \nOptions under Novartis equity plan “Select”  outside North America \nThe following table shows the activity associated with  the share options during the period. The weighted aver- age prices in the table below are translated from Swiss  francs into USD at historical rates. \nThe table displays information about stock options for the years 2021 and 2020, including the quantities and weighted average exercise prices. Here is a breakdown of the data:\n\n- The table includes two primary columns: one for the year 2021 and one for 2020. Each year's data is split into two sub-columns: one showing the number of options (in millions), and the other showing their weighted average exercise prices in USD.\n\nFor 2021:\n- Options outstanding at January 1: 2.6 million with an exercise price of $62.00.\n- Options sold or exercised: 0.9 million with an exercise price of $58.90.\n- Options outstanding as of December 31: 1.7 million with an exercise price of $63.60.\n- Options exercisable as of December 31: 1.7 million with an exercise price of $63.60.\n\nFor 2020:\n- Options outstanding at January 1: 3.4 million with an exercise price of $60.90.\n- Options sold or exercised: 0.8 million with an exercise price of $57.30.\n- Options outstanding as of December 31: 2.6 million with an exercise price of $62.00.\n- Options exercisable as of December 31: 2.6 million with an exercise price of $62.00.\n\nThe table demonstrates the changes in the number of options and their exercise prices over the two years, as well as the exercisable options at the end of each year.\nAll share options were granted at an exercise price that  was equal to the closing market price of the Group’s  shares at the grant date. The weighted average share  price at the dates of sale or exercise was USD 90.0. "}

Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n1. **Executive Officers:**\n   - Cash and other compensation:\n     - 2021: 20.3\n     - 2020: 25.6\n     - 2019: 20.7\n   - Post-employment benefits:\n     - 2021: 2.5\n     - 2020: 2.7\n     - 2019: 2.6\n   - Equity-based compensation:\n     - 2021: 37.3\n     - 2020: 41.1\n     - 2019: 40.6\n   - Total compensation:\n     - 2021: 60.1\n     - 2020: 69.4\n     - 2019: 63.9\n\n2. **Non-Executive Directors:**\n   - Cash and other compensation:\n     - 2021: 4.7\n     - 2020: 4.6\n     - 2019: 4.1\n   - Post-employment benefits: Not applicable or not provided\n   - Equity-based compensation:\n     - 2021: 5.2\n     - 2020: 5.2\n     - 2019: 4.6\n   - Total compensation:\n     - 2021: 9.9\n     - 2020: 9.8\n     - 2019: 8.7\n\n3. **Total for Both Executive Officers and Non-Executive Directors:**\n   - Cash and other compensation:\n     - 2021: 25.0\n     - 2020: 30.2\n     - 2019: 24.8\n   - Post-employment benefits:\n     - 2021: 2.5\n     - 2020: 2.7\n     - 2019: 2.6\n   - Equity-based compensation:\n     - 2021: 42.5\n     - 2020: 46.3\n     - 2019: 45.2\n   - Total compensation:\n     - 2021: 70.0\n     - 2020: 79.2\n     - 2019: 72.6\nDuring 2021, the IFRS compensation expense decreased  due to one role less at the ECN, and lower cash and  equity compensation attributable to former ECN mem- bers, partially offset by the net increase of the IFRS com- pensation expense of current ECN members. \nDuring 2020, the IFRS compensation expense  increased due to higher cash and other compensation.  This increase in cash compensation is mainly attribut- able to ECN members who joined the ECN during 2019.  As a result, 2019 represented only a portion of their  annual compensation. Other compensation increased  on account of higher social security payments on vested  equity-based compensation. \nThe Annual Incentive award, which is fully included  in equity-­ based compensation even when paid out in  cash, is granted in January in the year following the  reporting period. \nThe disclosures on Board and executive compensa- tion required by the Swiss Code of Obligations and in  accordance with the Swiss Ordinance against Excessive  Compensation in Stock Exchange Listed Companies are  shown in the Compensation Report of the Group. \n\nTransactions with former members of the Board of  Directors \nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the following payments (or  waivers of claims) were made to former Board members  or to “persons closely” linked to them: \nThe table shows financial data for Dr. Krauer over three years (2019, 2020, 2021). The currency is CHF (Swiss Francs), and the amount listed for each year is 60,000.\nDr. Alex Krauer, Honorary Chairman, was entitled to an  amount of CHF 60 000 for annual periods from one AGM  to the next. This amount was fixed in 1998 upon his  departure from the Board in 1999, and has not been  revised since that date. \n28. Commitments and contingencies \nResearch and development  commitments \nThe Group has entered into long-term research and  development agreements with various institutions related  to intangible assets, which provide for potential mile- stone payments by Novartis. As of December 31, 2021,  the Group’s commitments to make payments under those  agreements, and their ­ estimated timing, were as follows: \nThe table displays financial data in USD millions from the year 2021 onward:\n\n- 2022: 602 million\n- 2023: 1,088 million\n- 2024: 472 million\n- 2025: 629 million\n- 2026: 113 million\n- Thereafter: 3,839 million\n\nThe total for these amounts is 6,743 million."}

During  2021, there was a transfer of equity securities of USD 29  million from Level 1 to Level 3 due to de-listing (2020:  nil). \nRealized gains and losses associated with Level 3  long-term financial investments measured at fair value  through the consolidated income statement are recorded  in the consolidated income statement under “Other  income” or “Other expense,” respectively. Realized gains  and losses associated with Level 3 long-term financial  investments measured at fair value through other com- prehensive income are not recycled through the consol- idated income statement but are instead reclassified to  retained earnings. \nDuring the year, the net loss and net gain recorded  on associated companies, fund investments and long- term financial investments at fair value through profit and  loss were USD 173 million and USD 212 million, respec- tively. \nTo determine the fair value of a contingent  consideration, various unobservable inputs are used. A  change in these inputs might result in a significantly  higher or lower fair value measurement. The inputs used  are, among others, the probability of success, sales fore- cast and assumptions regarding the discount rate and  timing and different scenarios of triggering events.

{"page": 265, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_NVS_2021_265.jpg", "ocr_text": "Notes to the Novartis Group consolidated financial statements\n\nNature and extent of risks arising\nfrom financial instruments\n\nMarket risk\n\nMarket risk in general comprises currency risk, interest\nrate risk and price risk, such as commodity and equity\nprices. Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily\nrelated to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates\nand the market value of the investments. The Group\nactively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems\nit appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures.\nIt is the Group’s policy and practice to enter into a vari-\nety of derivative financial instruments to manage the vol-\natility of these exposures. It does not enter into any finan-\ncial transactions containing a risk that cannot be\nquantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In\naddition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or\ndoes not know it will have, in the future. The Group only\nsells existing assets or enters into transactions and\nfuture transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges)\nthat it confidently expects it will have in the future, based\non past experience.\n\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\n\nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency.\nAs a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency\nexchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese\nand emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the\nexchange rates between the US dollar and other curren-\ncies can have a significant effect on both the Group’s\nresults of operations, including reported sales and earn-\nings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, lia-\nbilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly\naffect the comparability of period-to-period results of\noperations.\n\nBecause our expenditures in Swiss francs are sig-\nnificantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, vol-\natility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a signifi-\ncant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets\nand liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility\ncan be difficult to predict.\n\nThere is also a risk that certain countries could\ndevalue their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the\neffective prices we would be able to charge for our prod-\nucts and also have an adverse impact on both our con-\nsolidated income statement and balance sheet.\n\nSubsidiaries whose functional currencies have expe-\nrienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than 100%\nover the past three years apply the rules of IAS 29 “Finan-\ncial reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.” The\nhyperinflationary economies in which Novartis operates\nare Argentina and Venezuela. Venezuela was hyperinfla-\ntionary for all years presented, and Argentina became\nhyperinflationary effective July 1, 2018, requiring retro-\nactive implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of\nJanuary 1, 2018. The impacts of applying IAS 29 were\nnot significant in all years presented.\n\nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by\nengaging in hedging transactions where management\ndeems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various con-\ntracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign cur-\nrency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets,\ncommitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also\n\nuses forward contracts and may enter into foreign cur-\nrency option contracts to hedge.\n\nNet investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries\nare long-term investments. Their fair value changes\nthrough movements of foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe Group has designated a certain portion of its long-\nterm euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the\ntranslation risk arising on certain of these net invest-\nments in foreign operations with euro functional cur-\nrency. As of December 31, 2021, long-term financial debt\nwith a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion (USD 2.1 billion;\nDecember 31, 2020: USD 2.3 billion), has been desig-\nnated as a hedge instrument. During 2021, USD 216 mil-\nlion of net of taxes unrealized income (unrealized loss in\n2020: USD 201 million) was recognized in other compre-\nhensive income and accumulated in currency translation\neffects in relation with this net investment hedge. The\nhedge remained effective since inception, and no amount\nwas recognized in the consolidated income statement\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nCommodity price risk\n\nThe Group has only a very limited exposure to price risk\nrelated to anticipated purchases of certain commodities\nused as raw materials by the Group’s businesses. A\nchange in those prices may alter the gross margin of a\nspecific business, but generally by not more than 10% of\nthe margin and thus below the Group’s risk management\ntolerance levels. Accordingly, the Group does not enter\ninto significant commodity futures, forward or option\ncontracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated\npurchases.\n\nInterest rate risk\n\nThe Group addresses its net exposure to interest rate\nrisk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial\ndebt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total\nfinancial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may\nenter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it\nexchanges periodic payments based on a notional\namount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest\nrates.\n\nEquity risk\n\nThe Group may purchase equities as investments of its\nliquid funds.

Novartis is exposed to market risk, primarily  related to foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates  and the market value of the investments. The Group  actively monitors and seeks to reduce, where it deems  it appropriate to do so, fluctuations in these exposures.  It is the Group’s policy and practice to enter into a vari- ety of derivative financial instruments to manage the vol- atility of these exposures. It does not enter into any finan- cial transactions containing a risk that cannot be  quantified at the time the transaction is concluded. In  addition, it does not sell short assets it does not have, or  does not know it will have, in the future. The Group only  sells existing assets or enters into transactions and  future transactions (in the case of anticipatory hedges)  that it confidently expects it will have in the future, based  on past experience.  \nForeign currency exchange rate risk \nThe Group uses the US dollar as its reporting currency.  As a result, the Group is exposed to foreign currency  exchange movements, primarily in European, Japanese  and emerging market currencies. Fluctuations in the  exchange rates between the US dollar and other curren- cies can have a significant effect on both the Group’s  results of operations, including reported sales and earn- ings, as well as on the reported value of our assets, lia- bilities and cash flows. This, in turn, may significantly  affect the comparability of period-to-period results of  operations. \nBecause our expenditures in Swiss francs are sig- nificantly higher than our revenues in Swiss francs, vol- atility in the value of the Swiss franc can have a signifi- cant impact on the reported value of our earnings, assets  and liabilities, and the timing and extent of such volatility  can be difficult to predict. \nThere is also a risk that certain countries could  devalue their currency. If this occurs, it could impact the  effective prices we would be able to charge for our prod- ucts and also have an adverse impact on both our con- solidated income statement and balance sheet. \nSubsidiaries whose functional currencies have expe- rienced a cumulative inflation rate of more than   $100\\%$  over the past three years apply the rules of IAS 29 “Finan - cial reporting in Hyper inflationary Economies.” The  hyper inflationary economies in which Novartis operates  are Argentina and Venezuela. Venezuela was hyperinfla- tionary for all years presented, and Argentina became  hyper inflationary effective July 1, 2018, requiring retro- active implementation of hyperinflation accounting as of  January 1, 2018. The impacts of applying IAS 29 were  not significant in all years presented. \nThe Group manages its global currency exposure by  engaging in hedging transactions where management  deems appropriate. Novartis may enter into various con- tracts that reflect the changes in the value of foreign cur- rency exchange rates to preserve the value of assets,  commitments and anticipated transactions. Novartis also  uses forward contracts and may enter into foreign cur- rency option contracts to hedge. \n\nNet investments in subsidiaries in foreign countries  are long-term investments. Their fair value changes  through movements of foreign currency exchange rates.  The Group has designated a certain portion of its long- term euro-denominated straight bonds as hedges of the  translation risk arising on certain of these net invest- ments in foreign operations with euro functional cur- rency. As of December 31, 2021, long-term financial debt  with a carrying amount of EUR 1.8 billion (USD 2.1 billion;  December 31, 2020: USD 2.3 billion), has been desig- nated as a hedge instrument. During 2021, USD 216 mil- lion of net of taxes unrealized income (unrealized loss in  2020: USD 201 million) was recognized in other compre- hensive income and accumulated in currency translation  effects in relation with this net investment hedge. The  hedge remained effective since inception, and no amount  was recognized in the consolidated income statement  in 2021, 2020 and 2019. \nCommodity price risk \nThe Group has only a very limited exposure to price risk  related to anticipated purchases of certain commodities  used as raw materials by the Group’s businesses. A  change in those prices may alter the gross margin of a  specific business, but generally by not more than  $10\\%$   of  the margin and thus below the Group’s risk management  tolerance levels. Accordingly, the Group does not enter  into significant commodity futures, forward or option  contracts to manage fluctuations in prices of anticipated  purchases. \nInterest rate risk \nThe Group addresses its net exposure to interest rate  risk mainly through the ratio of its fixed-rate financial  debt to variable-rate financial debt contained in its total  financial debt portfolio. To manage this mix, Novartis may  enter into interest rate swap agreements, in which it  exchanges periodic ­ payments based on a notional  amount and agreed-upon fixed and variable interest  rates. \nEquity risk \nThe Group may purchase equities as investments of its  liquid funds. As a policy, it limits its holdings in an unre- lated company to less than  $5\\%$   of its liquid funds. Poten- tial investments are thoroughly analyzed. Call options  are written on equities that the Group owns, and put  options are written on equities that the Group wants to  buy and for which cash is available. \nCredit risk \nCredit risks arise from the possibility that customers may  not be able to settle their obligations as agreed. To man- age this risk, the Group periodically assesses country  and customer credit risk, assigns individual credit limits,  and takes actions to mitigate credit risk where appropri- ate. \nThe provisions for expected credit losses for cus- tomers are based on a forward-looking expected credit  loss, which includes possible default events on the trade  receivables over the entire holding period of the trade  receivables.

{"page": 276, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_NVS_2021_276.jpg", "ocr_text": "Report of the statutory auditor\n\nThe Group financial statements are a consolidation\nof over 200 reporting entities. We identified four report-\ning entities that, in our view, required an audit of their\ncomplete financial information due to their size or risk\ncharacteristics. We worked very closely with and received\nfull scope reporting from the divisional audit teams for\nInnovative Medicines and Sandoz, each being a global\nbusiness. To obtain appropriate coverage of material bal-\nances, we also received 19 full scope reports from report-\ning entity audit teams for the full scope audit work per-\nformed on account balances and one specified\nprocedures report. None of the reporting entities\nexcluded from our Group audit scope individually con-\ntributed more than 5% to net sales or total assets. Audit\nprocedures were also performed by the Group audit\nteam over the Group’s Corporate activities, certain Group\nfunctions (including accounting for associated compa-\nnies, taxation, treasury, certain employee benefits, gov-\nernment investigations and litigation) and Group consol-\nidation.\n\nTo exercise the appropriate direction and supervision\nover the work of the divisional and reporting entity audit\nteams, the Group audit team reviewed audit working\npapers, virtually participated in meetings between the\ndivisional and reporting entity audit teams, and virtually\nattended selected meetings between divisional manage-\nment and divisional audit teams.\n\nKey audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our profes-\nsional judgement, were of most significance in our audit\nof the consolidated financial statements of the current\nperiod. These matters were addressed in the context of\nour audit of the consolidated financial statements as a\nwhole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not\nprovide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\nIntangible Assets Impairment Assessments -\nInnovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed\nProducts\n\nKey audit matter\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated finan-\ncial statements, the Group has intangible assets in its\nInnovative Medicines Division other than goodwill total-\ning USD 32.4 billion at December 31, 2021, including cur-\nrently marketed products of USD 25.9 billion. The Group\nrecognized impairments of intangible assets in its\nInnovative Medicines Division other than goodwill of USD\n367 million during the year. In most cases, no directly\nobservable market inputs are available to measure the\nfair value less costs of disposal that is used to determine\nif the asset is impaired. Therefore, an estimate is derived\nindirectly and is based on net present value techniques\nutilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. The esti-\nmates that management used in calculating the net pres-\nent values depend on assumptions specific to the nature\nof the Innovative Medicines Division’s activities with\nregard to the amount and timing of projected future cash\nflows; long-term sales forecasts; actions of competitors\n(launch of competing products, marketing initiatives,\netc.); sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other\nintellectual property rights protection, and timing of the\n\nentry of generic competition; outcome of research and\ndevelopment activities (compound efficacy, results of\nclinical trials, etc.); amount and timing of projected costs\nto develop in-process research and development into\ncommercially viable products; profit margins; probability\nof obtaining regulatory approval; future tax rate; and dis-\ncount rate.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the intangible\nassets impairment assessments of the Innovative\nMedicines Division currently marketed products is a key\naudit matter are the significant judgment by management\nwhen developing the net present value of the intangible\nassets.

We identified four report- ing entities that, in our view, required an audit of their  complete financial information due to their size or risk  characteristics. We worked very closely with and received  full scope reporting from the divisional audit teams for  Innovative Medicines and Sandoz, each being a global  business. To obtain appropriate coverage of material bal- ances, we also received 19 full scope reports from report- ing entity audit teams for the full scope audit work per- formed on account balances and one specified  procedures report. None of the reporting entities  excluded from our Group audit scope individually con- tributed more than  $5\\%$   to net sales or total assets. Audit  procedures were also performed by the Group audit  team over the Group’s Corporate activities, certain Group  functions (including accounting for associated compa- nies, taxation, treasury, certain employee benefits, gov- ernment investigations and litigation) and Group consol- idation. \nTo exercise the appropriate direction and supervision  over the work of the divisional and reporting entity audit  teams, the Group audit team reviewed audit working  papers, virtually participated in meetings between the  divisional and reporting entity audit teams, and virtually  attended selected meetings between divisional manage- ment and divisional audit teams. \nKey audit matters \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our profes- sional judgement, were of most significance in our audit  of the consolidated financial statements of the current  period. These matters were addressed in the context of  our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a  whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not  provide a separate opinion on these matters. \nIntangible Assets Impairment Assessments –  Innovative Medicines Division Currently Marketed  Products \nKey audit matter \nAs described in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated finan- cial statements, the Group has intangible assets in its  Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill total- ing USD 32.4 billion at December 31, 2021, including cur- rently marketed products of USD 25.9 billion. The Group  recognized impairments of intangible assets in its  Innovative Medicines Division other than goodwill of USD  367 million during the year. In most cases, no directly  observable market inputs are available to measure the  fair value less costs of disposal that is used to determine  if the asset is impaired. Therefore, an estimate is derived  indirectly and is based on net present value techniques  utilizing post-tax cash flows and discount rates. The esti- mates that management used in calculating the net pres- ent values depend on assumptions specific to the nature  of the Innovative Medicines Division’s activities with  regard to the amount and timing of projected future cash  flows; long-term sales forecasts; actions of competitors  (launch of competing products, marketing initiatives,  etc.); sales erosion rates after the end of patent or other  intellectual property rights protection, and timing of the  entry of generic competition; outcome of research and  development activities (compound efficacy, results of  clinical trials, etc.); amount and timing of projected costs  to develop in-process research and development into  commercially viable products; profit margins; probability  of obtaining regulatory approval; future tax rate; and dis- count rate. \n\nThe principal considerations for our determination  that performing procedures relating to the intangible  assets impairment assessments of the Innovative  Medicines Division currently marketed products is a key  audit matter are the significant judgment by management  when developing the net present value of the intangible  assets. This in turn led to a high degree of auditor judg- ment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures  and evaluating management’s significant assumptions  related to the amount and timing of projected future cash  flows (specifically the long-term sales forecasts). \nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures  and evaluating audit evidence in connection with form- ing our overall opinion on the consolidated financial  statements. These procedures included testing the  effectiveness of controls relating to management’s intan- gible assets impairment assessments, including controls  over the Innovative Medicines Division currently mar- keted products. These procedures also included, among  others, testing management’s process for developing the  fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the  net present value techniques; testing the completeness  and accuracy of underlying data used in the model; and  evaluating the significant assumptions used by manage- ment, including the amount and timing of projected future  cash flows. Evaluating management’s assumptions  related to the amount and timing of projected future cash  flows involved evaluating whether the assumptions used  by management were reasonable considering the cur- rent and past performance of the intangible assets, the  consistency with external market and industry data, and  whether these assumptions were consistent with evi- dence obtained in other areas of the audit. \nAs a result of our procedures, we did not propose any  adjustments to the amount of impairment recognized in  2021. For Innovative Medicines Division currently mar- keted products where management determined that no  impairment was required, we found that the assessments  made by management were based upon reasonable  assumptions, consistently applied. \nUS Managed Care, Medicare Part D and Medicaid  Rebates Key audit matter \nAs described in Note 1 and 22 to the consolidated finan- cial statements, the consideration Novartis receives in  exchange for its goods or services may be fixed or vari- able. Variable consideration is only recognized when it  is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.  Rebates and discounts granted to government agencies,  wholesalers, retail pharmacies, managed healthcare  organizations and other customers, as well as charge- backs are provisioned and recorded as a revenue deduc- tion at the time the related revenues are recorded or  when the incentives are offered. They are calculated on  the basis of historical experience, regulations, the spe- cific terms in the individual agreements, product pricing  and the mix of products, contracts, channels and pay- ors. The provision reported as of December 31, 2021 for  revenue deductions amounted to USD 6.5 billion, a sig- nificant portion of which related to US Managed Care,  Medicare Part D and Medicaid rebates.

Our responsibilities under\nthose provisions and standards are further described in\nthe “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the finan-\ncial statements” section of our report.\n\nWe are independent of the entity in accordance with the\nprovisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the\nSwiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other\nethical responsibilities in accordance with these require-\nments. We believe that the audit evidence we have\nobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis\nfor our opinion.\n\nOur audit approach\n\nMateriality\n\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our applica-\ntion of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide rea-\nsonable assurance that the financial statements are free\nfrom material misstatement. Misstatements may arise\ndue to fraud or error. They are considered material if,\nindividually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be\nexpected to influence the economic decisions of users\ntaken on the basis of the financial statements.\n\nBased on our professional judgement, we determined\ncertain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including\nthe overall materiality for the financial statements as a\nwhole as set out in the table below.

Our responsibilities under  those provisions and standards are further described in  the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the finan- cial statements” section of our report. \nWe are independent of the entity in accordance with the  provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the  Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other  ethical responsibilities in accordance with these require- ments. We believe that the audit evidence we have  obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis  for our opinion. \nOur audit approach \nMateriality \nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our applica- tion of materiality. Our audit opinion aims to provide rea- sonable assurance that the financial statements are free  from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise  due to fraud or error. They are considered material if,  individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be  expected to influence the economic decisions of users  taken on the basis of the financial statements. \nBased on our professional judgement, we determined  certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, including  the overall materiality for the financial statements as a  whole as set out in the table below. These, together with  qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the  scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of  our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of mis- statements, both individually and in aggregate, on the  financial statements as a whole. \n\nOverall materiality CHF 412 million \nBenchmark applied  Profit before tax \nRationale for the materiality benchmark applied \nWe chose income before taxes as the benchmark  because, in our view, it is the benchmark against which  the performance of Novartis AG is most commonly mea- sured, and it is a generally accepted benchmark. \nWe agreed with the Audit and Compliance Committee  that we would report to them misstatements above CHF  23 million identified during our audit as well as any mis- statements below that amount which, in our view, war- ranted reporting for qualitative reasons. \nAudit scope \nWe designed our audit by determining materiality and  assessing the risks of material misstatement in the finan- cial statements. In particular, we considered where sub- jective judgements were made; for example, in respect  of significant accounting estimates that involved making  assumptions and considering future events that are  inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also  addressed the risk of management override of internal  controls, including among other matters consideration  of whether there was evidence of bias that represented  a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. \nWe tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform  sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the  financial statements as a whole, taking into account the  structure of the entity, the accounting processes and  controls, and the industry in which the entity operates. \nReport on key audit matters based on  the circular 1/2015 of the Federal  Audit Oversight Authority \nWe have determined that there are no key audit matters  to communicate in our report. \nResponsibilities of the Board of  Directors for the financial statements \nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the prepara- tion of the financial statements in accordance with the  provisions of Swiss law and the company’s articles of  incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board  of Directors determines is necessary to enable the  preparation of financial statements that are free from  material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
