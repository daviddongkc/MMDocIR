While the  development of such products typically is significantly  less costly and complex than the development of the  equivalent originator medicines, it is nonetheless signifi- cantly more costly and complex than that for typical  small-molecule generic products. See also “Item 4. Infor- mation on the Company—Item 4.B Business overview— Sandoz—Development and registration” with regards to  the research and development efforts of our Sandoz Divi- sion. In addition, many countries do not yet have fully  developed legislative or regulatory pathways to facilitate  the development of biosimilars and permit their sale in a  manner in which they are readily substitutable alterna- tives to the originator product. Further delays or difficul- ties in the development or marketing of biosimilars could  put at risk the significant investments that Sandoz has  made, and will continue to make, in its Biopharmaceuti- cals business.

We divide the development process  into two stages: Exploratory Development to establish  proof of concept, followed by Confirmatory Development  to confirm the concept in large numbers of patients.  Exploratory Development consists of clinical proof-of- concept (PoC) studies, which are small clinical trials (typ- ically involving between five and 15 patients) that com- bine elements of traditional Phase  I/II testing. NIBR  conducts these customized trials, which are designed to  give early insights into issues such as safety, efficacy  and toxicity for a drug in a given indication. Once a pos- itive proof of concept has been established, the drug  moves to the Confirmatory Development stage and  becomes the responsibility of GDD. Confirmatory Devel- opment has elements of traditional Phase II/III testing  and includes trials aimed at confirming the safety and  efficacy of the drug in the given indication, leading up to  submission of a dossier to health authorities for approval.  This stage can also include trials that compare the drug  to the current standard of care for the disease in order  to evaluate the drug’s overall benefit-risk profile. Further,  with new treatment approaches such as gene therapy  for rare diseases, elements of Exploratory and Confir- matory Development may be combined and suffice for  registration under certain conditions such as high unmet  medical need and clinical data showing highly favorable  benefit-risk. In these cases, additional post-approval  studies may be required by the regulatory authorities to  continue to gather important data to further support  approval.

This certification often results in a  patent infringement lawsuit being brought against the  generics company.

For generic  applicants who are the first to file their ANDA containing  a certification claiming non‑infringement or patent inva- lidity, the Hatch‑Waxman Act generally provides those  applicants with 180  days of marketing exclusivity,  enabling such generic applicants to exclusively market  their product alongside the reference product at a cer- tain point in time, which is generally after any intellectual  property issues have been resolved.

Here's a breakdown of the content:\n\n1. **Level**: \n   - The policy states that the overall compensation package should be market-competitive to attract global executive talent with expertise and competencies.\n\n2. **Annual Base Salary**: \n   - For new roles, the Compensation Committee may offer a salary below market level but aims to increase it to market level over three to four years as the individual develops in their role. This approach ensures merit-based salary increases and recognizes sustained strong performance and proven ability.\n\n3. **Incentives**: \n   - The compensation package typically includes key compensation elements and incentives similar to those offered to current Executive Committee members. Higher Long-Term Incentive opportunities may be provided in exceptional circumstances. Performance measures could include business-specific targets tailored to the role.\n\n4. **Pension and Other Benefits**: \n   - New Executive Committee members are eligible for local country pension plans and other benefits aligned with the wider employee group.\n\n5. **Buyouts**: \n   - The Compensation Committee balances offering competitive compensation opportunities with maintaining a strong pay-for-performance focus. If an individual forfeits variable compensation due to an appointment, replacement awards may be offered. Relevant factors considered include the type of replacement vehicle, performance conditions, value, and timing of forfeiture, and any leaver conditions. The committee aims to match only the commercial fair value of forfeited payments and awards.\n\n6. **International Mobility**: \n   - For executives required to relocate or work away from home, relocation support is provided according to global mobility policies. This includes covering US state income tax liabilities for US citizens employed outside the US who have US workdays and generate US state taxable compensation."}

These factors have con- tributed to decisions by Novartis and other ­ co­ mpanies  in the healthcare industry, when deemed in their interest,  to enter into settlement agreements with governmental  authorities around the world prior to any formal decision  by the authorities or a court. These government settle- ments have involved and may in the future involve large  cash payments, sometimes in the hundreds of millions  of dollars or more, including the potential repayment of  amounts allegedly obtained improperly and other pen- alties, including treble damages.
