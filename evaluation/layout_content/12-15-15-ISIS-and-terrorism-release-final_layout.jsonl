The first graph on the left illustrates the level of concern about Islamic extremism around the world, and the second graph on the right shows the concern about Islamic extremism in the U.S. The percentages indicate the respondents' level of concern, which is categorized into three levels: \"Very concerned\" (represented by a dark gold line), \"Somewhat concerned\" (represented by a light gold line), and \"Not too/Not at all concerned\" (represented by a gray line).\n\n- In the graph about Islamic extremism around the world, the percentage of people \"very concerned\" increased significantly from 48% in 2007 to 62% in 2014 and 2015. Meanwhile, the \"somewhat concerned\" category decreased from 33% in 2007 to 27% in 2015. The \"not too/not at all concerned\" category also saw a decrease from 17% in 2007 to 10% in 2015.\n\n- In the graph about Islamic extremism in the U.S., the percentage of people \"very concerned\" rose from 46% in 2007 to a peak of 53% in 2014, then slightly decreased to 49% in 2015. The \"somewhat concerned\" category started at 32% in 2007 and decreased to 29% in 2015. The \"not too/not at all concerned\" category fluctuated but stayed roughly constant, with 20% in 2007 and slightly decreasing to 20% again in 2015 after a small peak.\n\nOverall, the data shows a trend of increasing concern over Islamic extremism, both globally and in the U.S., over the given period."}
