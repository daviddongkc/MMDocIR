L advises the  Department’s bureaus from the beginning to the end of an international crisis and as  new issues emerge.  The turn of world events regularly requires legal counsel on  international law obligations, foreign assistance programming, and protecting refugees  and U.S. citizens, among other issues.  Without L’s input on major international events  including natural disasters, health emergencies, and conflict situations, the Department  risks not fully taking into account its obligations under international law.  As a leader on  the world stage, our international partners expect that the United States always  operates well within the letter of international law and will provide leadership and a  firm legal foundation during crisis and conflicts situations.  L also provides substantial  legal counsel to consular professionals, who adjudicate millions of visa and passport  issuances and refusals annually and advises Department principals on politically  sensitive international child abduction cases and complicated adoptions of foreign-born  children by American citizens, among other high-profile consular and management- related issues.  L is an essential partner in supporting the Department‘s management  operations by providing legal advice on a wide range of matters, including the provision  of consular services; border security; buildings and acquisitions; U.S. diplomatic and  consular operations abroad.
