{"page": 4, "image_path": "doc_images/NETFLIX_2015_10K_4.jpg", "ocr_text": "Table of Contents\n\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our\ncommon stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected.\n\nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability\nto consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies.\nFurthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and\nretain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those\nthat provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust\nexisting features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract\nand retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts\nto satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be\nadversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household\nexpenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily\nresolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If\ngrowth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able\nto adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of\noperation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and\nattracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur\nsignificantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members.\n\nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact\nour business.\n\nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have\nincreasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and\npiracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage\nour business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of\nthe compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and\ncable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Several of these\ncompetitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure\nbetter terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and\nmarketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment\nvideo. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions.

Risk Factors \nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. \nRisks Related to Our Business \nIf our efforts to attract and retain members are not successful, our business will be adversely affected. \nWe have experienced significant membership growth over the past several years. Our ability to continue to attract members will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide our members with compelling content choices, as well as a quality experience for selecting and viewing TV shows and movies. Furthermore, the relative service levels, content offerings, pricing and related features of competitors to our service may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain memberships. Competitors include other entertainment video providers, such as MVPDs, Internet-based movie and TV content providers (including those that provide pirated content) and DVD rental outlets. If consumers do not perceive our service offering to be of value, including if we introduce new or adjust existing features, adjust pricing or service offerings, or change the mix of content in a manner that is not favorably received by them, we may not be able to attract and retain members. In addition, many of our members are rejoining our service or originate from word-of-mouth advertising from existing members. If our efforts to satisfy our existing members are not successful, we may not be able to attract members, and as a result, our ability to maintain and/or grow our business will be adversely affected. Members cancel our service for many reasons, including a perception that they do not use the service sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, availability of content is unsatisfactory, competitive services provide a better value or experience and customer service issues are not satisfactorily resolved. We must continually add new memberships both to replace canceled memberships and to grow our business beyond our current membership base. If growth rates slow faster than expected, given, in particular that our content costs are largely fixed in nature and contracted over several years, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures or increase our (per membership) revenues commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margins, liquidity and results of operation may be adversely impacted. If we are unable to successfully compete with current and new competitors in both retaining our existing memberships and attracting new memberships, our business will be adversely affected. Further, if excessive numbers of members cancel our service, we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditures than we currently anticipate to replace these members with new members. \nChanges in competitive offerings for entertainment video, including the potential rapid adoption of piracy-based video offerings, could adversely impact our business. \nThe market for entertainment video is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. Through new and existing distribution channels, consumers have increasing options to access entertainment video. The various economic models underlying these channels include subscription, transactional, ad-supported and piracy-based models. All of these have the potential to capture meaningful segments of the entertainment video market. Piracy, in particular, threatens to damage our business, as its fundamental proposition to consumers is so compelling and difficult to compete against: virtually all content for free. Furthermore, in light of the compelling consumer proposition, piracy services are subject to rapid global growth. Traditional providers of entertainment video, including broadcasters and cable network operators, as well as Internet based e-commerce or entertainment video providers are increasing their Internet-based video offerings. Several of these competitors have long operating histories, large customer bases, strong brand recognition and significant financial, marketing and other resources. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing and devote more resources to product development, technology, infrastructure, content acquisitions and marketing. New entrants may enter the market or existing providers may adjust their services with unique offerings or approaches to providing entertainment video. Companies also may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. If we are unable to successfully or profitably compete with current and new competitors, our business will be adversely affected, and we may not be able to increase or maintain market share, revenues or profitability. \nThe long-term and fixed cost nature of our content commitments may limit our operating flexibility and could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. \nIn connection with obtaining streaming content, we typically enter into multi-year commitments with studios and other content providers, the payment terms of which are not tied to member usage or the size of our membership base (“fixed cost”) but which may be tied to such factors as titles licensed and/or theatrical exhibition receipts. Such commitments are included in the Contractual Obligations section of Item 7,  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Note 6,  Commitments and Contingencies  in Item 8  .

For the year ended\nDecember 31, 2015, the impact from membership growth was slightly offset by a decrease in average monthly revenue per paying streaming membership resulting\nfrom unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations impacting our International streaming segment. This was partially offset by increases resulting from price changes\nand plan mix. The decrease in operating income for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 is due primarily to\nincreased marketing and headcount costs to support our international expansion in addition to increased content expenses as we continue to acquire, license and\nproduce content, including more Netflix originals. Net income is further impacted by the increase in interest expense associated with our debt issuance in the first\nquarter of 2015 as well as to an increase in losses on foreign currency denominated transactions.\n\nWe offer three types of streaming membership plans. In the U.S. our basic plan is priced at $7.99 per month and includes access to standard definition quality\nstreaming on a single screen at a time. Our most popular streaming plan is priced at $9.99 per month and includes access to high definition quality streaming on\ntwo screens concurrently. Our premium plan is priced at $11.99 per month and includes access to high definition and ultra-high definition quality content on four\nscreens concurrently. Internationally, the membership plans are structured similarly to the U.S. and range in price from the U.S. dollar equivalent of approximately\n$5.00 to $18.00 per month.\n\nWe expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change. For instance, in the second half of 2015, we increased the\nprice of our two-screen high definition plan in the U.S. and several European countries. In May 2014, in the U.S., we increased the price of our high definition plan\nfrom $7.99 per month to $8.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a two year period. In October 2015, in the U.S., we increased the price of\nthis same high definition plan from $8.99 per month to $9.99 per month with existing memberships grandfathered for a one year period. In 2016, the grandfathered\npricing period will expire for a substantial number of U.S. memberships and the members will have the option of electing the basic streaming plan at $7.99 or\ncontinuing on the high definition plan at the higher price of $9.99.\n\nThe following represents the key elements to our segment results of operations:\n\n* We define contribution profit (loss) as revenues less cost of revenues and marketing expenses incurred by the segment.

Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and / or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, like the U.S. output deal with Disney, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements.

We may recognize a tax benefit only if it is\nmore likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits\nrecognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized\nupon settlement. At December 31, 2015, our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefits were $17.1 million of which $13.5 million, if recognized, would favorably\nimpact our future earnings. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change\nand the actual tax benefits may differ significantly from the estimates. See Note 10 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for further\ninformation regarding income taxes.\n\nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe grant fully vested non-qualified stock options to our employees on a monthly basis. As a result of immediate vesting, stock-based compensation expense\nis fully recognized on the grant date, and no estimate is required for post-vesting option forfeitures. Stock-based compensation expense at the grant date is based on\nthe total number of options granted and an estimate of the fair value of the awards.\n\nWe calculate the fair value of our stock option grants using a lattice-binomial model. This model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions.\nChanges in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be impacted.\n\n+ Expected Volatility: Prior to January 1, 2015, our computation of expected volatility was based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock\nand implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock, as low trade volume of our tradable forward call options\nprior to 2011 precluded sole reliance on implied volatility. Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We\nbelieve that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade\nvolumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An\nincrease/decrease of 10% in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by\napproximately $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\n+ Suboptimal Exercise Factor: Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2015, we bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor.\nBeginning on January 1, 2015, we began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous\nbifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted. An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise\nfactor of 10% would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately $4.3 million for the year ended December 31,\n2015.\n\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign\ncurrency fluctuations.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without\nsignificantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure\nto interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various\nasset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale\nand are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current\ninvestment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that\nour investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest\nrates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then-\nprevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2015 , our cash equivalents were generally\ninvested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk\n\n29\n", "vlm_text": "We did not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes.

Beginning on January 1, 2015, expected volatility is based solely on implied volatility. We believe that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and, given consistently high trade volumes of the options, can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock. An increase/decrease of  $10\\%$   in our computation of expected volatility would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately  $\\S10.6$   million for the year ended December 31, 2015. • Suboptimal Exercise Factor:   Our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical and estimated option exercise behavior. Prior to January 1, 2015, we bifurcated its option grants into two employee groupings (executive and non-executive) to determine the suboptimal exercise factor. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we began aggregating employee groupings for its determination of the suboptimal exercise factor as the previous bifurcation into two groupings did not have a material impact on the fair value of the options granted. An increase/decrease in the suboptimal exercise factor of  $10\\%$   would increase/decrease the total stock-based compensation expense by approximately   $\\S4.3$   million for the year ended December 31, 2015. \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \nWe are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our investments, debt and foreign currency fluctuations. \nInterest Rate Risk \nThe primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal, while at the same time maximizing income we receive from investments without significantly increased risk. To achieve this objective, we follow an established investment policy and set of guidelines to monitor and help mitigate our exposure to interest rate and credit risk. The policy sets forth credit quality standards and limits our exposure to any one issuer, as well as our maximum exposure to various asset classes. We maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term investments in a variety of securities. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 , we had no impairment charges associated with our short-term investment portfolio. Although we believe our current investment portfolio has very little risk of material impairment, we cannot predict future market conditions or market liquidity and can provide no assurance that our investment portfolio will remain materially unimpaired. Some of the securities we invest in may be subject to market risk due to changes in prevailing interest rates which may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate. For example, if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then- prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises, the value of our investment will decline. At December 31, 2015 , our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds, which are not subject to market risk "}

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\n\nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”’) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet\ntelevision network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day,\nincluding original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen.\nMembers can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs.\n\nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are\ngenerated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived\nfrom monthly membership fees.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have\nbeen eliminated.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires\nmanagement to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of\nthe financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.

If a\ncloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the\nacquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a\nservice contract.

Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nNetflix, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated on August 29, 1997 and began operations on April 14, 1998. The Company is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 75 million streaming members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments. Additionally, in the United States (\"U.S.\"), members can receive DVDs. \nThe Company has three reportable segments, Domestic streaming, International streaming and Domestic DVD. A majority of the Company’s revenues are generated in the United States, and substantially all of the Company’s long-lived tangible assets are held in the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived from monthly membership fees. \nBasis of Presentation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated. \nUse of Estimates \nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization policy for the streaming content assets; the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities; and the valuation of stock-based compensation. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. \nStock Split \nOn July 14, 2015, the Company completed a  seven -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend. References made to outstanding shares or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this  seven -for-one stock split. The number of authorized shares as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was not affected by the stock split and accordingly has not been adjusted. See Note 8 for additional information. \nAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2015 \nIn April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2015-05,  Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement,  which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for a cloud computing arrangement as a service contract. The Company elected to early adopt the ASU in the third quarter of 2015 and has applied the guidance prospectively to all arrangements. The impact of the adoption of the ASU was not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. \nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 as of December 31, 2015, and retrospectively re class if ed  $\\S14.2$   million of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's long-term debt as of December 31, 2014 from other non-current assets to long-term debt. \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.

ASU 2014-09 establishes principles for recognizing revenue upon the transfer of promised goods or services to customers, in an amount that\nreflects the expected consideration received in exchange for those goods or services.

Deferred revenue consists of membership fees billed that have not been recognized and gift and other prepaid memberships\nthat have not been redeemed.\n\nMarketing\n\nMarketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and also include payments made to the Company’s affiliates and consumer electronics\npartners. Advertising expenses include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
