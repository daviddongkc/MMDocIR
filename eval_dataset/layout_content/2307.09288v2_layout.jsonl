{"layout": 101, "type": "text", "text": "The fact that helpfulness and safety performed the best on their own domain is potentially due to the tension between the two objectives (i.e., being as helpful as possible versus refusing unsafe prompts when necessary), which may confuse the reward model during training. In order for a single model to perform well on both dimensions, it needs to not only learn to select the better response given a prompt but also to distinguish adversarial prompts from safe ones. As a result, optimizing two separate models eases the reward modeling task. More detailed analysis on this tension between safety and helpfulness can be found in Appendix A.4.1. When we group the scores by preference rating in Table 8, we can see that the accuracy is superior for the “significantly better” test set and degrades gradually as comparison pairs become more similar (e.g., “slightly better”). It is expected that learning to model human preferences becomes challenging when deciding between two similar model responses, due to annotator subjectivity and their reliance on nuanced details that may differentiate responses.

Based on our experience, an open approach draws upon the collective wisdom, diversity, and ingenuity of the AI-practitioner community to realize the benefits of this technology. Collaboration will make these models better and safer. The entire AI community—academic researchers, civil society, policymakers, and industry—must work together to rigorously analyze and expose the risks of current AI systems and to build solutions that address potentially problematic misuse. This approach not only fosters real collaboration with diverse stakeholders—those beyond the walls of big tech companies—but also serves as the cornerstone for democratizing access to foundational models. As argued in Zellers et al. (2019b), open releases promote transparency and allow more people to access AI tools, democratizing the technology and decentralizing AI expertise. We believe that the decentralization of AI expertise does more than simply distribute knowledge—it stimulates innovation and accelerates progress in the industry. Lastly, openly releasing these models consolidates costs and eliminates barriers to entry, allowing small businesses to leverage innovations in LLMs to explore and build text-generation use cases. Ultimately, we believe this will create a more level playing field for organizations of all sizes across the globe to benefit from the economic growth promised by the advancement of AI.

(2020), several Large Language Models with more than 100B parameters have been proposed, from GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) to Gopher (Rae et al., 2022) or specialized models, e.g. Galactica, for science(Taylor et al., 2022). With 70B parameters, Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) redefined those scaling laws towards the number of tokens rather than model weights. Notable in this progression is the rise of Llama, recognized for its focus on computational efficiency during inference (Touvron et al., 2023). A parallel discourse has unfolded around the dynamics of open-source versus closed- source models. Open-source releases like BLOOM (Scao et al., 2022), OPT(Zhang et al., 2022), and Falcon (Penedo et al., 2023) have risen to challenge their closed-source counterparts like GPT-3 and Chinchilla.

The comparisons are made for two different context lengths, 256 and 2k tokens, with the output length fixed at 128 tokens.\n\n- The left graph is for a context length of 256 tokens:\n  - Throughput (Queries Per Second, QPS) is plotted on the y-axis.\n  - Latency per token (in milliseconds, ms) is plotted on the x-axis.\n  - The results show that all three variants have a steep increase in throughput up to around 45-50 QPS at a latency of approximately 40-60 ms as the batch size increases.\n  - The MHA variant performs comparably in throughput to MQA and GQA but ends with an out-of-memory error for larger batch sizes.\n\n- The right graph is for a context length of 2k tokens:\n  - The throughput values are generally lower than those for a context length of 256 tokens, with a maximum around 3-4 QPS.\n  - The MQA and GQA variants maintain successful runs at higher batch sizes without an out-of-memory error, whereas MHA encounters an out-of-memory error at a smaller batch size, similar to the 256 context scenario.\n\nThe caption suggests that multi-query variants allow for higher throughput with larger batch sizes and maintain similar latency when dealing with smaller batches. MHA tends to reach its memory limits at lower batch sizes compared to MQA and GQA in large context settings."}

However,\nit’s important to note that what looks great on one person may not look great on another, as everyone’s hair texture, face\nshape, and personal style are unique. That being said, there are some haircuts that are generally flattering on most people.\nHere are a few options:\n\n1. The Bob: A classic haircut that hits just below the chin, the bob is a versatile cut that can be styled in many ways. It’s a\ngreat option for those with straight, wavy, or curly hair.\n\n2. The Pixie Cut: A short haircut that is generally flattering on most people, the pixie cut is a great option for those with\nheart-shaped faces or angular features. It’s a low-maintenance cut that can be styled with or without bangs.\n\n3. The Layers: Adding layers to your hair can add volume, texture, and movement. This haircut is great for those with\nstraight, wavy, or curly hair, and can be styled with or without bangs.\n\n4. The Shag: A choppy, layered haircut that is generally flattering on most people, the shag is a great option for those with\nround or oval faces.

It’s\nalways a good idea to consult with a professional hairdresser who can assess your unique features and suggest a haircut\nthat will complement your individual style and preferences.\n\nVicuna-13b-v1.1\n\nAs a language model, I don’t have personal experience as a hair dresser, but generally speaking, a good haircut that looks\ngreat on everyone is a classic, timeless style that flatters the individual’s face shape, hair texture, and personal style. Some\nexamples of such hairstyles include:\n\nBob: A classic bob haircut can look great on anyone, whether it’s a chin-length bob or a longer, more dramatic version.\nLayers: Adding layers to a hairstyle can add dimension and movement, and can look great on a variety of face shapes.\nPixie cut: A pixie cut is a short, choppy hairstyle that can look great on anyone with a round or oval face shape.\n\nUpdo: An updo is a great option for those with curly or wavy hair, as it can help to keep the hair out of their face and\nshowcase their features.Ultimately, the best haircut for someone will depend on their individual features and personal\nstyle, so it’s important to consult with a professional stylist who can help determine the best look for you.\n\nPaLM-bison-chat\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the best haircut for everyone will vary depending on their individual\nhair type, face shape, and personal style. However, some haircuts that tend to look good on most people include the bob,\nlob, and pixie cut. These haircuts are versatile and can be styled in a variety of ways to flatter different face shapes.\n\nThe bob is a classic haircut that has been popular for decades.

It is a flattering haircut for\nmost face shapes, and it can be easily dressed up or down.\n\nThe lob is a longer version of the bob. It is a haircut that is typically cut just below the shoulders. The lob can be blunt,\nangled, or layered, and it can be styled straight, wavy, or curly. It is a flattering haircut for most face shapes, and it is a\ngood option for those who want a longer haircut that is still easy to manage.\n\nThe pixie cut is a short haircut that is typically cut above the ears. It is a versatile haircut that can be styled in a variety of\nways, including with bangs, without bangs, or with a side part. The pixie cut is a good option for those who want a short,\nlow-maintenance haircut.\n\nUltimately, the best haircut for you is the one that you feel most confident and comfortable in.
