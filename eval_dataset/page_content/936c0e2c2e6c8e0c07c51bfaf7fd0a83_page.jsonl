All entries aim at \"Strengthening Consular and Management Capabilities.\"\n  - *Measurement Area*: Categorizes the type of measurement, such as Customer Results, Mission and Business Results, Processes and Activities, and Technology.\n  - *Measurement Category*: Groups measurements into categories like Benefit, Service Accessibility, Human Resource Management, Cycle Time and Resource Time, Quality, and Reliability and Availability.\n  - *Measurement Grouping*: Further classifies the metric under a specific performance grouping, like Satisfaction, Availability, Response Time, Organization and Position Management, Cycle Time, Errors, and so on.\n  - *Measurement Indicator*: Describes the specific metric itself, e.g., \"satisfaction of program applications\" or \"Number of HRM services under the IPMS program.\"\n  - *Baseline*: Provides a reference point or starting value for each metric.\n  - *Target*: Shows the intended performance goal for each metric.\n  - *Actual Results*: Gives the outcome or performance achieved.\n\n- **Key Observations**:\n  - There are several recurring measurements across different years, like Employee Self-Service Functions under IPMS, HR Help Desk response time, and the agency ranking score on DoS CPDF submissions.\n  - In 2005 and 2006, the IPMS achieved or exceeded many of its targets, such as improving HR Help Desk response time, the number of HRM services under IPMS, and maintaining or exceeding certain accuracy and timeliness scores.\n  - In 2007, user satisfaction for IPMS reached 90%, surpassing the initial target of 82%.\n  - By 2006, some performance data was no longer provided by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for agency ranking scores and cycle time percentages.\n\nEach row represents a distinct performance metric measured against baseline values, targeted goals, and the actual results achieved in the specified fiscal year."}
