Coordination with regional bureaus remains vital to successfully implementing and amplifying economic   policies and achieving the market-oriented economic reforms articulated in Joint   Strategic Plan Objective 2.3. EB will empower EB’s Regional Coordinators, who serve in   a liaison position between the bureau and regional bureaus and develop jointeconomic strategies with regional bureaus. Promoting and increasing staff use of economic   resources will result in a more efficient and effective workforce. A lack of access to   and/or knowledge of technological solutions available to personnel constrain our work.   Some staff are often unaware of existing resources such as Haver and Econ@State. EB   personnel have uneven technology skills, hampering bureau-wide productivity. With   improved access and training, EB could be more agile, ensuring it is well prepared to confront 21st century global challenges. Stakeholders include the Bunche librarians, E-   Diplomacy, Department of Commerce Analytics section, and School of Professional   Studies – Economic and Commercial Studies at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI).   Quality economic analysis informs and improves policy decisions, both economic and   broader strategic policy. It provides important context to social and political   developments and quantifies effects. EB plays a central role in improving State’s   economic analysis by leveraging its own expertise and producing analytic products and by providing and encouraging officers to use economic data resources. One risk is that policy formulation will occur without the economic angle being fully considered, leading to a disempowering of economic staff throughout the State Department.
