Table  1  gives concrete exam- ples: for the Named Entity Recognition (NER) task ( Sang and De Meulder ,  2003 ;  Nadeau and Sekine ,  2007 ), most tokens are backgrounds with tagging class    $O$  . Speciﬁcally, the number of to- kens with tagging class    $O$   is 5 times as many as those with entity labels for the CoNLL03 dataset and 8 times for the OntoNotes5.0 dataset; Data- imbalanced issue is more severe for MRC tasks ( Rajpurkar et al. ,  2016 ;  Nguyen et al. ,  2016 ;  Ra- jpurkar et al. ,  2018 ;  Ko cisk y et al. ,  2018 ;  Dasigi et al. ,  2019 ) with the value of negative-positive ra- tio being 50-200, which is due to the reason that the task of MRC is usually formalized as predicting the  starting  and  ending  indexes conditioned on the query and the context, and given a chunk of text of an arbitrary length, only two tokens are positive (or of interest) with all the rest being background. \nData imbalance results in the following two issues: (1)  the training-test discrepancy : Without bal- ancing the labels, the learning process tends to con- verge to a point that strongly biases towards class with the majority label. This actually creates a dis- crepancy between training and test: at training time, each training instance contributes equally to the objective function, whereas at test time, F1 gives equal weight to positive and negative examples; (2) the overwhelming effect of easy-negative exam- ples . As pointed out by  Meng et al.  ( 2019 ), a sig- niﬁcantly large number of negative examples also means that the number of easy-negative example is large. The huge number of easy examples tends to overwhelm the training, making the model not sufﬁciently learn to distinguish between positive examples and hard-negative examples. The cross- entropy objective (CE for short) or maximum like- lihood (MLE) objective, which is widely adopted as the training objective for data-imbalanced NLP tasks ( Lample et al. ,  2016 ;  Wu et al. ,  2019 ;  Devlin et al. ,  2018 ;  Yu et al. ,  2018a ;  McCann et al. ,  2018 ; Ma and Hovy ,  2016 ;  Chen et al. ,  2017 ), handles neither of the issues.

The Sgrensen—Dice coefficient, dice\nloss for short, is the harmonic mean of precision\nand recall. It attaches equal importance to false pos-\nitives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs) and is thus\nmore immune to data-imbalanced datasets. Tver-\nsky index extends dice loss by using a weight that\ntrades precision and recall, which can be thought as\nthe approximation of the Fg score, and thus comes\nwith more flexibility. Therefore, we use dice loss\nor Tversky index to replace CE loss to address the\nfirst issue.\n\nOnly using dice loss or Tversky index is not enough\nsince they are unable to address the dominating\ninfluence of easy-negative examples. This is intrin-\nsically because dice loss is actually a soft version\nof the Fl score.

Meanwhile, the model can\nhardly distinguish between hard-negative examples\nand positive ones. Inspired by the idea of focal\nloss (Lin et al., 2017) in computer vision, we pro-\npose a dynamic weight adjusting strategy, which\nassociates each training example with a weight in\nproportion to (1 — p), and this weight dynamically\nchanges as training proceeds. This strategy helps\ndeemphasize confident examples during training as\ntheir probability p approaches 1, making the model\nattentive to hard-negative examples, and thus alle-\nviates the dominating effect of easy-negative exam-\n\nples. Combing both strategies, we observe signif-\nicant performance boosts on a wide range of data\nimbalanced NLP tasks.\n\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: re-\nlated work is presented in Section 2.

The mechanism can be easily extended to multi-class classiﬁcation. Let    $X$   denote a set of training instances and each instance  $x_{i}\\in X$  sociated with a golden binary label  $y_{i}=[y_{i0},y_{i1}]$  denoting the ground-truth class    $x_{i}$   belongs to, and    $p_{i}\\,=\\,[p_{i0},p_{i1}]$   is the predicted probabilities pect  $y_{i0},y_{i1}\\ \\in$   $\\{0,1\\},p_{i0},p_{i1}\\in[0,1]$  { }  ∈  and  $p_{i1}+p_{i0}=1$  . \n3.2 Cross Entropy Loss \nThe vanilla cross entropy (CE) loss is given by: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CE}=-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i}\\sum_{j\\in\\{0,1\\}}y_{i j}\\log p_{i j}\n$$\n \nAs can be seen from Eq. 1 , each    $x_{i}$   contributes equally to the ﬁnal objective. Two strategies are normally used to address the the case where we wish that not all  $x_{i}$   are treated equally: associating different classes with different weighting factor    $\\alpha$  or resampling the datasets. For the former, Eq. 1  is adjusted as follows: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{CE}=-\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i}\\alpha_{i}\\sum_{j\\in\\{0,1\\}}y_{i j}\\log p_{i j}\n$$\n \nwhere    $\\alpha_{i}\\in[0,1]$   may be set by the inverse class frequency or treated as a hyperparameter to set by cross validation. In this work, we use    $\\mathrm{lg}\\big(\\frac{n-n_{t}}{n_{t}}+K\\big)$  to calculate the coefﬁcient    $\\alpha$  , where  $n_{t}$   is the num- ber of samples with class    $t$   and    $n$   is the total number of samples in the training set.    $K$   is a hyperparam- eter to tune. Intuitively, this equation assigns less weight to the majority class and more weight to the minority class. The data resampling strategy con- structs a new dataset by sampling training examples from the original dataset based on human-designed criteria, e.g. extracting equal training samples from each class. Both strategies are equivalent to chang- ing the data distribution during training and thus are of the same nature. Empirically, these two meth- ods are not widely used due to the trickiness of selecting    $\\alpha$   especially for multi-class classiﬁcation tasks and that inappropriate selection can easily bias towards rare classes ( Valverde et al. ,  2017 ). \n3.3 Dice Coefﬁcient and Tversky Index \nSørensen–Dice coefﬁcient ( Sorensen ,  1948 ;  Dice , 1945 ), dice coefﬁcient (DSC) for short, is an F1- oriented statistic used to gauge the similarity of two sets. Given two sets    $A$   and    $B$  , the vanilla dice coefﬁcient between them is given as follows: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{DSC}(A,B)=\\frac{2|A\\cap B|}{|A|+|B|}\n$$\n \nIn our case,    $A$   is the set that contains all positive examples predicted by a speciﬁc model, and    $B$   is the set of all golden positive examples in the dataset. When applied to boolean data with the deﬁnition of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), and false negative (FN), it can be then written as follows: \n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}{\\mathrm{DSC}=\\frac{2\\mathrm{TP}}{2\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FN}+\\mathrm{FP}}=\\frac{2\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FN}}\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}}}{\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FN}}+\\frac{\\mathrm{TP}}{\\mathrm{TP}+\\mathrm{FP}}}}\\\\ {=\\frac{2\\mathrm{Pre}\\times\\mathrm{Res}}{\\mathrm{Pre}+\\mathrm{Res}}=F1\\qquad}\\end{array}\n$$\n \nFor an individual example    $x_{i}$  , its corresponding dice coefﬁcient is given as follows: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{DSC}(x_{i})=\\frac{2p_{i1}y_{i1}}{p_{i1}+y_{i1}}\n$$\n \nAs can be seen, a negative example   $(y_{i1}=0)$  ) does not contribute to the objective. For smoothing pur- poses, it is common to add a    $\\gamma$   factor to both the nominator and the denominator, making the form to be as follows (we simply set    $\\gamma=1$   in the rest of Table 2: Different losses and their formulas. We add  $+1$  to DL, TL and DSC so that they are positive. "}

Addition- ally,  Milletari et al.  ( 2016 ) proposed to change the denominator to the square form for faster conver- gence, which leads to the following dice loss (DL): \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{{DL}}=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i}\\left[1-\\frac{2p_{i1}y_{i1}+\\gamma}{p_{i1}^{2}+y_{i1}^{2}+\\gamma}\\right]\n$$\n \nAnother version of DL is to directly compute set- level dice coefﬁcient instead of the sum of individ- ual dice coefﬁcient, which is easier for optimiza- tion: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{{DL}}=1-{\\frac{2\\sum_{i}p_{i1}y_{i1}+\\gamma}{\\sum_{i}p_{i1}^{2}+\\sum_{i}y_{i1}^{2}+\\gamma}}\n$$\n \nTversky index (TI), which can be thought as the approximation of the  $F_{\\beta}$   score, extends dice coefﬁ- cient to a more general case.

The computa- tion of  $F1$   score is actually as follows: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{F}1(x_{i})=2\\,\\frac{\\mathbb{I}(p_{i1}>0.5)y_{i1}}{\\mathbb{I}(p_{i1}>0.5)+y_{i1}}\n$$\n \nThe image is a graph showing the derivatives of four different loss functions with respect to the probability of the ground-truth label (\\( \\bar{p_i} \\)). The four loss functions included are:\n\n1. **FL (Focal Loss, \\(\\gamma=1\\))** - represented by a blue line.\n2. **DL (Dice Loss, \\(\\gamma=1\\))** - represented by an orange line.\n3. **TL (Tversky Loss, \\(\\beta=0.5\\))** - represented by a yellow line.\n4. **DSC (Dice Similarity Coefficient)** - represented by a purple line.\n\nThe y-axis denotes the derivatives, while the x-axis shows the probability of the ground-truth label. The caption notes that the derivative of the Dice Similarity Coefficient approaches zero after the probability exceeds 0.5, whereas the derivatives of the other loss functions reach zero only when the probability is exactly 1, encouraging the probability to reach 1 as much as possible.\nComparing Eq. 5  with Eq. 11 , we can see that Eq. 5 is actually a soft form of    $F1$  , using a continuous    $p$  rather than the binary  $\\mathbb{I}(p_{i1}>0.5)$  . This gap isn’t a big issue for balanced datasets, but is extremely detrimental if a big proportion of training examples are easy-negative ones: easy-negative examples can easily dominate training since their probabil- ities can be pushed to 0 fairly easily. Meanwhile, the model can hardly distinguish between hard- negative examples and positive ones, which has a huge negative effect on the ﬁnal F1 performance. \nTo address this issue, we propose to multiply the soft probability  $p$   with a decaying factor    $(1-p)$  , changing Eq. 11  to the following adaptive variant of DSC: \n\n$$\n\\mathrm{DSC}(x_{i})=\\frac{2(1-p_{i1})p_{i1}\\cdot y_{i1}+\\gamma}{(1-p_{i1})p_{i1}+y_{i1}+\\gamma}\n$$\n \nOne can think    $\\left(1-p_{i1}\\right)$   as a weight associated with each example, which changes as training proceeds. The intuition of changing    $p_{i1}$   to    $(1-p_{i1})p_{i1}$   is to push down the weight of easy examples. For easy examples whose probability are approaching 0 or 1,    $(1-p_{i1})p_{i1}$   makes the model attach signiﬁcantly less focus to them. \nA close look at Eq. 12  reveals that it actually mim- ics the idea of focal loss (FL for short) ( Lin et al. , 2017 ) for object detection in vision. Focal loss was proposed for one-stage object detector to han- dle foreground-background tradeoff encountered during training. It down-weights the loss assigned to well-classiﬁed examples by adding a    $(1-p)^{\\gamma}$  factor, leading the ﬁnal loss to be    $-(1-p)^{\\gamma}\\log p$  . "}

We report Extract\nMatch (EM) as well as F1 score on validation set.\nWe use three datasets on this task: SQuAD v1.1,\nSQuAD v2.0 (Rajpurkar et al., 2016, 2018) and\nQuoref (Dasigi et al., 2019).\n\nBaselines We used the following baselines:\n\ne@ QANet: Yu et al.

The table includes references to original model papers, indicated by author names and publication years.\n4.2 Named Entity Recognition \nSettings Named entity recognition (NER) is the task of detecting the span and semantic category of entities within a chunk of text. Our implementation uses the current state-of-the-art model proposed by Li et al.  ( 2019 ) as the backbone, and changes the MLE loss to DSC loss. Datasets that we use in- clude OntoNotes4.0 ( Pradhan et al. ,  2011 ), MSRA ( Levow ,  2006 ), CoNLL2003 ( Sang and Meulder 2003 ) and OntoNotes5.0 ( Pradhan et al. ,  2013 ). We report span-level micro-averaged precision, recall and F1. \nBaselines We use the following baselines: \n•  ELMo:  a tagging model with pretraining from  Peters et al.  ( 2018 ). •  Lattice-LSTM:  Zhang and Yang  ( 2018 ) con- structs a word-character lattice, only used in Chinese datasets. •  CVT:  Clark et al.  ( 2018 ) uses Cross-View Training(CVT) to improve the representations of a Bi-LSTM encoder. •  Bert-Tagger:  Devlin et al.  ( 2018 ) treats NER as a tagging task. • Glyce-BERT: Wu et al. (2019) combines Chi-nese glyph information with BERT pretrain- ing. •  BERT-MRC: Li et al.  ( 2019 ) formulates NER as a machine reading comprehension task and achieves SOTA results on Chinese and English NER benchmarks. \nResults Table  5  shows experimental results on NER datasets. DSC outperforms BERT-MRC( Li et al. ,  2019 ) by   $+0.29$  ,  $+0.96$  ,   $+0.97$   and  $+2.36$   re- spectively on CoNLL2003, OntoNotes5.0, MSRA and OntoNotes4.0.

In addition, we can observe that the performance varies a lot as  $\\alpha$   changes in distinct datasets, which shows that the hyperparameters  $\\alpha,\\beta$   acturally play an important role in TI. \n6 Conclusion \nIn this paper, we propose the dice-based loss to narrow down the gap between training objective and evaluation metrics (F1 score). Experimental results show that the proposed loss function help "}
