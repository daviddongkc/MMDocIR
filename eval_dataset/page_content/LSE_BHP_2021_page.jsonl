{"page": 6, "image_path": "page_images/LSE_BHP_2021_6.jpg", "ocr_text": "Strategic\nReport\n\n1.3 Chief Executive Officer's review\n\nDear Shareholders,\n\nlam pleased to report that BHP performed\nstrongly in FY2021, with no one fatally injured\nacross BHP’s global operations, and record\nproduction and throughput in a number of\nbusinesses. We completed four major capital\nprojects on time and on budget, a notable feat\ngiven the pandemic context, and our approach\nto capital allocation remained disciplined,\ngenerating strong returns for shareholders.\n\n| want to thank our employees and all those who\nsupported us in delivering these outcomes.\n\nOur operational and financial results provide\nthe strong foundation upon which we have\nannounced our investment in the Jansen\nStage 1 potash project, the intended merger\nof BHP’s Petroleum business with Woodside\nPetroleum Ltd. (Woodside), and the intention\nto unify the BHP corporate structure under a\nsingle primary listing in Australia. These strategic\nsteps are intended to underpin BHP’s ability\nto continue to grow shareholder value in the\ncoming decades.\n\nThe future is clear. We believe that the world is\ngoing to need increasing supply of the essential\ncommodities BHP produces in order to sustain\nglobal economic growth and in order to\ndecarbonise the global economy. It is important\nfor the world that this growing demand is met\nsustainably, and BHP is ideally positioned to\n\ndo so given our portfolio of existing assets, our\nstrong track record on sustainability and social\nvalue creation, our operating and financial\ndiscipline, and most importantly our people.\n\nThe intended unification of BHP’s corporate\nstructure will position us even more strongly to\nbe able to continue growing shareholder value.\nWe will be a simpler, more efficient and more\nagile company. This is expected to enable us to\nbe more competitive and to more quickly create\nand capitalise on opportunities to continue\n\nto grow value.\n\nThe intended merger of BHP’s Petroleum\nbusiness with Woodside will create a global\n\ntop 10 independent exploration and production\ncompany, with increased scale and resilience.\nWe expect shareholders to benefit from\nsignificant synergies arising from the intended\nmerger, and they will have greater choice in how\nto shape the relative commodity exposures in\ntheir own portfolios.\n\nThe decision to proceed with the Jansen\nStage 1 potash project in Canada is a significant\nmilestone for BHP. Potash is a future facing\ncommodity that enables more efficient and\nsustainable farming, which will be increasingly\nimportant in feeding a growing global\npopulation and in meeting the world’s need\n\nto decarbonise. Jansen Stage 1 also opens up\nanew front for future growth for BHP. We will\n\nbe ideally positioned to meet potential future\ngrowth in global demand for potash with Jansen\nStages 2 through 4, which we anticipate will\noffer high returns and faster paybacks.\n\nThese decisions and intended steps are\nanticipated to result in around half of BHP’s\nrevenues being derived from the future facing\ncommodities of copper, potash and nickel by\nthe end of this decade. We also expect the\nother half, comprising iron ore and higher-\nquality coking coal, to see upside as the\n\nworld decarbonises.\n\nBHP continues to take action on climate\nchange. In the past year we announced a new\nsuite of climate change related targets and\ngoals, together with an assessment of the\nperformance of BHP’s portfolio under different\nclimate scenarios. The latter indicated that BHP’s\noverall portfolio is resilient and, in fact, many of\nour commodities would perform best under\nour Paris-aligned scenario that sees more rapid\ndecarbonisation and an increase in average\nglobal temperature of no more than 1.5°C.\n\nWe progressed towards our operational\nemissions reduction targets and goal by\nentering into renewable power supply\nagreements for our Kwinana nickel refinery\nand Queensland Coal operations - adding\nto the Escondida and Spence copper mine\nagreements announced in FY2020.\n\nWith a focus on Scope 3 emissions, we entered\ninto partnerships with major steel producers\n\nin China and Japan, targeting technologies\n\nto reduce emissions from steel making.\n\nThe combined output of these steel companies\nequates to around 10 per cent of reported\nglobal steel production.

We completed four major capital  projects on time and on budget, a notable feat  given the pandemic context, and our approach  to capital allocation remained disciplined,  generating strong returns for shareholders.  I want to thank our employees and all those who  supported us in delivering these outcomes.  \nOur operational and financial results provide  the strong foundation upon which we have  announced our investment in the Jansen  Stage 1 potash project, the intended merger  of BHP’s Petroleum business with Woodside  Petroleum Ltd. (Woodside), and the intention  to unify the BHP corporate structure under a  single primary listing in Australia. These strategic  steps are intended to underpin BHP’s ability  to continue to grow shareholder value in the  coming decades. \nThe future is clear. We believe that the world is  going to need increasing supply of the essential  commodities BHP produces in order to sustain  global economic growth and in order to  decarbonise the global economy. It is important  for the world that this growing demand is met  sustainably, and BHP is ideally positioned to  do so given our portfolio of existing assets, our  strong track record on sustainability and social  value creation, our operating and financial  discipline, and most importantly our people.  \nThe intended unification of BHP’s corporate  structure will position us even more strongly to  be able to continue growing shareholder value.  We will be a simpler, more efficient and more  agile company. This is expected to enable us to  be more competitive and to more quickly create  and capitalise on opportunities to continue  to grow value. \nThe intended merger of BHP’s Petroleum  business with Woodside will create a global  top 10 independent exploration and production  company, with increased scale and resilience.  We expect shareholders to benefit from  significant synergies arising from the intended  merger, and they will have greater choice in how  to shape the relative commodity exposures in  their own portfolios.  \nThe decision to proceed with the Jansen  Stage 1 potash project in Canada is a significant  milestone for BHP. Potash is a future facing  commodity that enables more efficient and  sustainable farming, which will be increasingly  important in feeding a growing global  population and in meeting the world’s need  to decarbonise. Jansen Stage 1 also opens up  a new front for future growth for BHP. We will  be ideally positioned to meet potential future  growth in global demand for potash with Jansen  Stages 2 through 4, which we anticipate will  offer high returns and faster paybacks. \nThese decisions and intended steps are  anticipated to result in around half of BHP’s  revenues being derived from the future facing  commodities of copper, potash and nickel by  the end of this decade. We also expect the  other half, comprising iron ore and higher- quality coking coal, to see upside as the  world decarbonises.  \nBHP continues to take action on climate  change. In the past year we announced a new  suite of climate change related targets and  goals, together with an assessment of the  performance of BHP’s portfolio under different  climate scenarios. The latter indicated that BHP’s  overall portfolio is resilient and, in fact, many of  our commodities would perform best under  our Paris-aligned scenario that sees more rapid  decarbonisation and an increase in average  global temperature of no more than  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  . \nWe progressed towards our operational  emissions reduction targets and goal by  entering into renewable power supply  agreements for our Kwinana nickel refinery  and Queensland Coal operations – adding  to the Escondida and Spence copper mine  agreements announced in FY2020.  \nWith a focus on Scope 3 emissions, we entered  into partnerships with major steel producers  in China and Japan, targeting technologies  to reduce emissions from steel making.  \nThe combined output of these steel companies  equates to around 10 per cent of reported  global steel production. We also entered into a  series of innovative initiatives that seek to help  reduce emissions in bulk shipping.  \nFinally, we continue to invest in people.  In FY2021, we trained more than 500  apprentices and trainees through our FutureFit  Academy in Australia, and have committed to  creating 2,500 new Australian apprenticeship  and trainee positions over the next five years.  We have continued our progress towards  gender balance and female participation  in our workforce increased to 29.8 per cent  during the year, complementing our already  gender-balanced Executive Leadership Team.  Our Indigenous participation rate has also  increased to 7.2 per cent in Australia and 7.5 per  cent in Chile. We are leading the way in building  the workforce of the future.  \nI hope that you can see that this has been a  very good year for BHP. We have taken action to  shape BHP’s future, while delivering very strong  operational and financial results. \nThe combination of a clear strategic outlook,  increasing operational excellence and greater  exposure to future facing commodities is  expected to enable us to deliver positive returns  and grow more value for all of our stakeholders  in the years ahead. \nThank you for your ongoing support. \n\nMike Henry  Chief Executive Officer \nI am pleased to report that BHP  performed strongly in FY2021, with no  one fatally injured across BHP’s global  operations, and record production and  throughput in a number of businesses.  We completed four major capital  projects on time and on budget.” "}

In our 1.5°C scenario, we\nanticipate demand for primary copper almost\ndoubling and demand for primary nickel almost\nquadrupling over the next 30 years, compared\nto the past 30 years.

We see oil and gas\nremaining attractive in terms of their investment\nfundamentals for at least the next decade.\n\nThere is no easy path to achieving net zero\nemissions, but we believe the world has a\nresponsibility to meet this challenge. The task\nof reducing emissions is more difficult in some\nsectors and countries, and that activities that\nreduce or remove carbon, such as natural\nclimate solutions or carbon capture, use and\nstorage, will be required to offset those carbon-\n\nemitting activities that are harder to abate, such\nas industrial processes like steel and cement\nmanufacturing, as the world aims for net\n\nzero emissions.\n\nWe are taking action to play our part in\noperating more responsibly to provide essential\nresources.

The Risk  and Audit Committee (RAC) and Sustainability  Committee assist the Board by reviewing  and considering BHP’s risk profile (covering  operational, strategic and emerging risks)  on a biannual basis.  \nFor more information \nrefer to sections 2.1.7, 2.1.10 and 2.1.11 \nPerformance against risk appetite is monitored  and reported to the RAC, as well as the  Sustainability Committee for HSEC matters,  enabling the Board to challenge and hold  management to account where necessary. \nSecond-line risk-based reviews are undertaken  to provide greater oversight and enhance our  understanding and management of the Group’s  most significant risks, with outcomes reported  to management, the RAC and Sustainability  Committee. These outcomes may be used to  develop remediation plans, adjust BHP’s Risk  Appetite Statement or KRIs, enhance our Risk  Framework or inform strategic decisions. \n\nAdditional information on risk management  and internal controls is shared between the  Board, the RAC and, for HSEC matters, the  Sustainability Committee, and is provided  by the Business Risk and Audit Committees  (covering each business region), management  committees, our Internal Audit and Advisory  team and our External Auditor.  \nFor more information refer to section 2.1 \nRisk process \nOur Risk Framework requires identification  and management of risks (both threats and  opportunities) to be embedded in business  activities through the following process: \n\n \n–\t Risk identification – threats and opportunities  are identified and each is assigned an owner,  or accountable individual.\n\n –\t Risk assessments – risks are assessed using  appropriate and internationally recognised  techniques to determine their potential  impacts and likelihood, prioritise them and  inform risk treatment options.\n\n –\t Risk treatment – controls are implemented  to prevent, reduce or mitigate threats, and  enable or enhance opportunities.\n\n –\t Monitoring and review – risks and controls  are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc  basis (including where there are high- potential events or changes in the external  environment) to evaluate performance. \nOur Risk Framework includes requirements and  guidance on the tools and process to manage  current and emerging risks.  \nCurrent risks \nCurrent risks are risks that could impact BHP  today or in the near future, and comprise  current operational risks (risks that have their  origin inside BHP or occur as a result of our  activities) and current strategic risks (risks that  may enhance or impede the achievement of  our strategic objectives). \nCurrent risks include material and non-material  risks (as defined by our Risk Framework).  The materiality of a current risk is determined  by estimating the maximum foreseeable loss  (MFL) if that risk was to materialise. The MFL is  the estimated impact to BHP in a worst-case  scenario without regard to probability and  assuming all risk controls, including insurance  and hedging contracts, are ineffective. \nOur principal risks  \nare described in section 1.16 "}

Here's a breakdown of what is shown:\n\n- **Queensland Section**: \n  - Blue circles indicate BMA Mines (e.g., Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia, Caval Ridge, Peak Downs, Saraji).\n  - Purple circles indicate a BMC Mine (e.g., South Walker Creek).\n  - Terminal locations are marked with orange symbols (e.g., North Queensland Export Terminal, BMA Hay Point Coal Terminal, RG Tanna).\n  - Rail lines are shown with dashed blue lines connecting these sites.\n\n- **New South Wales Section**: \n  - A blue circle indicates the NSWEC (e.g., Mt Arthur).\n  - Various towns and cities are marked (e.g., Newcastle, Muswellbrook, Gunnedah).\n  - Rail lines are also shown with dashed blue lines.\n\n- **Inserts**: \n  - Maps of Australia highlighting the regions being shown (Queensland and New South Wales).\n\nEach symbol and line type on the map represents specific aspects of mining and export infrastructure.\nBMA operates seven metallurgical coal mines  – Goonyella Riverside, Broadmeadow, Daunia,  Peak Downs, Saraji, Blackwater and Caval  Ridge. With the exception of the Broadmeadow  underground longwall operation, BMA’s mines  are open cut. BMA also owns and operates  the Hay Point Coal Terminal near Mackay. \nEnergy coal \n3   \u0007 New South Wales Energy Coal \nOverview  \nNew South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) (BHP  ownership: 100 per cent) comprises the Mt Arthur  Coal open-cut energy coal mine in the Hunter  Valley. It has access to infrastructure in the Hunter  Region, including a multi-user rail network and coal  loading terminal access at the Port of Newcastle  through Newcastle Coal Infrastructure Group  (28 per cent owned by BHP) and Port Waratah  Coal Services. \nBMC owns and operates two open-cut  metallurgical coal mines – South Walker  Creek and Poitrel. \nKey developments in FY2021 \nQueensland Coal’s metallurgical coal production  was 41 Mt (41 Mt in FY2020), reflecting a strong  operational performance including record  production at Goonyella and record tonnes  from Broadmeadow, but offset by operational  delays due to significant wet weather impacts  and planned wash plant maintenance at Saraji  and Caval Ridge. At South Walker Creek, despite  record stripping, production decreased as a result  of higher strip ratios due to ongoing impacts from  geotechnical constraints and lower yields. \nKey developments in FY2021 \nNSWEC production decreased by 11 per cent  to 14 Mt (16 Mt in FY2020) reflecting operational  delays due to significant weather impacts and  higher strip ratios, as well as lower volumes due to  an increased proportion of washed coal. This was  due to our strategy to focus on higher-quality  products in response to increased price premiums  for these products, and reduced port capacity  following damage to a shiploader at the Newcastle  port in November 2020. The shiploader returned  to operation in July 2021. \nThe divestment process for our interests in BMC  that was announced in August 2020 is progressing,  in line with the two-year timeframe we set last  year. We remain open to all options and continue  consultation with relevant stakeholders. \nThe divestment process for NSWEC that was  announced in August 2020 is progressing, in  line with the two-year timeframe we set last year.

BHP recognises, as part of our Global  Indigenous Peoples Strategy, that we can contribute  to the economic empowerment of Indigenous  peoples through providing opportunities for  employment, training, procurement and supporting  Indigenous enterprises. Pre-employment training,  employment, career development and retention  of Indigenous employees are key to this. \nWe have set targets to achieve Indigenous  employment of 8 per cent in our Australian  workforce by the end of FY2025, 10 per cent in  our workforce in Chile by the end of FY2026 and  20 per cent in our Potash workforce in Canada by  the end of FY2027. \nIndigenous employment within our employee  and contractor workforce (5)  as at 30 June 2021  was 7.2 per cent in Australia, 7.5 per cent at  our operations in Chile and 13.7 per cent at  our Jansen Potash Project in Canada.  \nLGBT+ inclusion \nOur  $\\mathsf{L G B T+}$   ally employee inclusion group, Jasper,  was established in 2017 as a natural extension of  our inclusion and diversity aspirations and to reflect  Our Charter  value of respect.

This conduct is completely  unacceptable, contrary to our values and  unlawful. Over a number of years, we have  taken action to prevent sexual harassment  including through education, encouraging  reporting and security measures. While we  have made important progress, this continues  to be an issue at BHP and, as long as it does,  we must and will do more and we continue to  focus and invest in preventing this behaviour. \nIn 2018, we formally defined sexual assault  and sexual harassment as a health and safety  risk. As part of the risk assessment processes,  we engaged experts in health and safety,  harassment and inclusion and diversity.  We introduced a range of controls including  security measures such as on-site security  guards, additional CCTV, increased security  patrols in public areas and improved lighting,  with a further AU\\$300 million for planned  improvements to occur in FY2022. We have  also introduced trauma informed emergency  response, victim-centric investigations and a  dedicated support service that provides end-to- end assistance and advice to anyone impacted  by sexual assault and sexual harassment.

We participated in the Minerals Council  of Australia Taskforce that developed and  released an industry statement and Code of  Conduct aimed at eradicating sexual assault  and sexual harassment from our industry.  We also made a submission to the Inquiry  in Western Australia into sexual harassment  against women in the FIFO mining industry  to contribute to the industry addressing  this issue which can be found at BHP  Submission – WA Inquiry in relation to Sexual  Harassment in FIFO mining industry.pdf  (parliament.wa.gov.au). \nFor more information on reported cases  refer to section 1.13.6 \nMore information on safety is   available at  bhp.com/safety These are conditions impacting the  musculoskeletal system and connective tissues  caused by repetitive work-related stress or strain or  exposure over time.

We have  also set a medium-term target to reduce  operational GHG emissions by at least  30 per cent from FY2020 levels (2)  by FY2030.   This reflects our commitment to decarbonising  BHP’s operations and a recognition that we  have a part to play in accelerating the global  pathway to decarbonisation.  \nWe are also working to achieve our short- term target for FY2022 to maintain our total  operational GHG emissions at or below FY2017  levels (4)  while continuing to grow our business.  \nOur operational GHG emissions are measured  against our target performance based on an  operational control, market-based methodology.  We also disclose operational GHG emissions  by equity share and financial control in  section 4.8.5. \nIn FY2021, total operational energy consumption  increased 3 per cent from FY2020 due to  increased drilling activity in our Trinidad and  Tobago operations, the use of diesel generators  to provide power to our Angostura facility  during the Ruby project tie-in and increased  diesel usage at our Queensland Coal operated  assets. Building on our Light Electric Vehicle (LEV)  trials at Olympic Dam and Queensland Coal, we  have commenced LEV trials at Nickel West using  onboard battery power. This trial is anticipated to  reduce noise, heat and diesel particulate matter,  as well as consumption of fossil fuel. We have  increased the renewable component of our  energy consumption in FY2021 due to the start  of the renewable power purchasing agreement  (PPA) at Queensland Coal. \nIn FY2021, operational GHG emissions were  11 per cent higher than the adjusted FY2017  baseline of 14.6 MtCO 2 -e on a Continuing  operations basis, reflecting increased  production at our Minerals Australia operated  assets since FY2017. However, as a result of  actions taken in FY2020 and FY2021, particularly  securing the supply of renewable energy at  some operations, our forecasted operational  GHG emissions are currently tracking in line  with our FY2022 and FY2030 targets (see  Progress on decarbonisation, below). \n\n \nProgress on decarbonisation  \nIn FY2021:  \n–\t We signed a renewable PPA to supply up  to 50 per cent of our electricity needs at  the Nickel West Kwinana Refinery from the Merredin Solar Farm. \n\n –\t We secured firm renewable electricity via  a PPA to meet half of the electricity needs across Queensland Coal mines from low- emissions sources. \n\n \n(1)\t Net zero includes the use of carbon offsets as required.\n\n (2)\t FY2020 baseline will be adjusted for any material  acquisitions and divestments based on GHG emissions  at the time of the transaction.

Data in italics indicates that data has been adjusted since it was previously reported. FY2020 originally reported  data that has been restated is 9.5 MtCO 2 -e for Scope 1 GHG emissions and 15.8 MtCO 2 -e for total operational GHG emissions, due to minor amendments to fugitive emissions from the coal operated assets as part of the annual reconciliation process for Australian  regulatory reporting purposes. FY2019 data that has been restated is 6.1 MtCO 2 -e for Scope 2 GHG emissions, 15.8 MtCO 2 -e for total operational GHG emissions, and 15.3 MtCO 2 -e for total operational GHG emissions (adjusted for Discontinued operations) due to \nin prior year asset-level data and changes to presentation of the data has, in certain instances, resulted in minor impacts to the  rounding of data since it was previously reported.\n\n (2)\t Calculated based on an operational control approach in line with World Resources Institute/World Business Council for Sustainable  Development guidance. Consumption of fuel and consumption of electricity refers to annual quantity of energy consumed from the combustion of fuel; and the operation of any facility; and energy consumed resulting from the purchase of electricity, heat, steam or  cooling by the company for its own use. Over 99.9 per cent of BHP's energy consumption and operational GHG emissions occurs  outside the UK and offshore area (as defined in the relevant UK reporting regulations). UK energy consumption of 99,762 kWh and  GHG emissions of 21 tCO 2 -e is associated with electricity consumption from our office in London. One TWh equals 1,000,000,000 kWh. Data has been rounded to the nearest 1 PJ or 0.1 TWh to be consistent with asset/regional energy information in this Annual  Report. In some instances, the sum of totals for sources, commodities and assets may differ due to rounding.\n\n (3)\t In FY2021 we have revised and tightened the definition of renewable energy consumption for our operations to better align with  our market-based GHG emissions reporting. This resulted in the restatement of operational consumption from renewable energy  sources figures. Previously reported numbers for FY2020 and FY2019 for this data were 0.01 TWh for both years. \n\n (4)\t BHP currently uses Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Assessment  Report 5 (AR5) based on a 100-year timeframe for Minerals Australia and Petroleum.

This will enable more\nenergy-efficient vessel selection, as well as\nmore targeted emissions reduction insights\nand actions that can be pursued with our\nshipping partners.\n\nScope 3 GHG emissions\nperformance\n\nThe most significant contributions to BHP’s\ntotal reported Scope 3 emissions inventory\ncome from the downstream processing of\n\nour products, in particular from the GHG\nemissions generated by steelmaking through\nthe processing of iron ore and metallurgical\ncoal. Our analysis indicates that in FY2021,\nGHG emissions associated with the processing\nof our commodities (primarily iron ore and\nmetallurgical coal to steel; together with copper\nconcentrate and cathode to copper wire) were\n306 MtCO2-e. GHG emissions associated with\nthe use of our energy products (energy coal,\n\noil and gas)” were 76 MtCO>-e.\n\nWhile we have worked to eliminate major\n‘double-counting’ in our Scope 3 inventory of\nGHG emissions from iron ore and metallurgical\ncoal used in steelmaking, a degree of overlap\nin reporting boundaries still occurs due to our\ninvolvement at multiple points in the life cycle\nof the commodities we produce and consume.\nRefer to footnotes (1) and (7) to the table to the\nside for more information.\n\nWe continue to consider ways to understand\ndifferent metrics for measuring Scopes 1, 2 and\n3 GHG emissions intensity and tracking their\nimpact on long-term decarbonisation. To this\nend, in FY2021 we continued to engage with\nClimate Action 100+ (CA100+) and the Transition\nPathway Initiative on their methodology for the\ndiversified mining sector. We also progressed\npilot traceability studies in copper and nickel\nthat measure the value-chain GHG emissions\nof our products.\n\nInvesting in decarbonisation\n\nIn FY2020, we announced a commitment of at\nleast US$400 million to invest in GHG emissions\nreduction across our operated assets and\n\nvalue chain over the five-year life of our Climate\nInvestment Program. In FY2021, we spent\nUS$29 million under this program, targeting\noperational, maritime, steelmaking and BHP\nVentures investments, and committed to spend\nsignificantly more, including up to US$65 million\nover coming years towards partnerships with\nour customers in the steel sector.\n\nInline with our reporting methodology for Scope 3 GHG\nemissions, we define our energy products as oil, gas and\nenergy coal.

For example,\nthe International Energy Agency's ‘The Role of\nCritical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions’\nreport” highlights the critical role of copper and\nnickel, and BHP’s 1.5°C scenario® indicates that\nthe case for copper, nickel and potash could be\neven more compelling as the world takes action\nto decarbornise. Iron ore also fares slightly better\nunder our 1.5°C scenario versus other scenarios,\nas steel requirements of the energy transition\nare expected to be considerable. The most\ncommonly used measure for green revenue is\nbased on end use of products. However, this\nmeasure is not straightforward, for two reasons:\n\n- Identifying the end use of some commodities\nis challenging. Copper and iron ore, in\nparticular, undergo multiple stages of\nprocessing and have a diverse range\nof end uses.\n\n- The way in which commodities are\nproduced is not captured by end use\nmeasures. However, production methods for\nthe resource sector can in themselves be an\nimportant contributor to achieving a green\neconomy. For example, our Chilean copper\noperated asset at Escondida is on track to\nhave 100 per cent renewable electricity\nsupply by the mid-2020s and source\ndesalinated water for operational purposes,\nminimising water extraction from sensitive\nAndean aquifers.\n\nEnd use may therefore not be the sole\nappropriate measure of products’ contribution\nto the energy transition, and other measures\n(such as how they are produced) may also\n\nbe useful, and even more appropriate in\n\nsome circumstances.\n\nIn FY2021, we have applied an approach to\ngreen revenue based on end use, using nickel\nand uranium by way of illustration. At this\nstage, these are the most straightforward\n\nof our commodities for which to determine\ncontribution to the energy transition from their\nend use. In FY2022, we intend to continue to\nconsult with investors, industry and standard\nsetters to explore ways of establishing\n\nclear methodologies for classification and\nmeasurement of green revenue. We also\n\nplan to work with our customers, suppliers\nand others in our value chain to improve the\ntraceability of our products and the GHG\nemissions produced by their use.\n\nBattery manufacture contributes to climate\nchange mitigation.” Therefore, for illustrative\npurposes,® we have measured the revenue\nfrom our sales to battery materials suppliers as\n\ngreen revenue. Seventy-two per cent of\nBHP’s battery-suitable nickel metal® was\nsold to global battery material suppliers in\nFY2021.” For FY2021, BHP’s green revenue\nfrom battery-suitable nickel metal amounted\nto US$760 million\n\nAustralian uranium is sold for nuclear power\ngeneration only, a low emissions source of\nelectricity, and therefore, also for illustrative\npurposes, we have measured all revenue from\nuranium as green revenue. For FY2021, BHP’s\ngreen revenue from uranium amounted to\nUS$249 million.\n\nCarbon offsets\n\nBHP’s approach to carbon offsetting is to\nprioritise emission reduction projects at\n\nour operated assets, with investments in\nexternal carbon offset projects considered\ncomplementary to this ‘structural abatement’.\nWe work with others to promote the\ndevelopment of carbon market mechanisms,\nparticularly for natural climate solutions.\n\nAlthough we prioritise our internal emission\nreduction projects, we acknowledge a role\nfor high-quality offsets in a temporary or\ntransitional capacity while abatement options\nare being studied, as well as for ‘hard to\nabate’ emissions with limited or no current\ntechnological solutions.\n\nIn FY2021, we retired 0.3 million carbon offsets\nin the form of verified carbon units equivalent\nto the net increase in our FY2021 operational\nGHG emissions from FY2020. The offsets\nwere sourced from high-quality projects,\n\nsuch as the Cordillera Azul National Park\nREDD+Project and the Kasigau Corridor REDD\nProject,® representing additional, permanent\nand otherwise unclaimed emission reductions\nfrom activities designed to avoid contributing\nto social or environmental harms.\n\nFor more information on how BHP manages\noffsets refer to bhp.com/offsets-2021\n\nNatural climate solutions\n\nInvesting in natural ecosystems is a cost-\neffective and immediately available solution to\nmitigate climate change that often provides\nsustainability co-benefits, such as biodiversity\nconservation, improved water quality or support\nfor local communities.

This estimate has been included in existing  capital guidance. Going forward, as our  climate response is further integrated into  business-as-usual planning, our spending  on climate initiatives is expected to become  increasingly indistinguishable from normal  business spending.  \nWe assess and rank each decarbonisation  project across our operated assets through  our Capital Allocation Framework, where our  decarbonisation commitments rank alongside  maintenance capital in the hierarchy of our  capital allocation. Through our studies and  investment governance process, we seek to  optimise the risk and reward proposition for  these projects to allocate capital and optimise  decarbonisation at a portfolio level. We have  developed an internal marginal abatement cost  curve designed to support the allocation of  capital towards the most economically efficient  and effective decarbonisation projects.  \nWe include regional carbon price forecasts in  our assessment of all projects in the Capital  Allocation Framework. In recognition that  explicit carbon pricing regimes in many  instances do not fully reflect the implicit  regulatory risk and value of carbon across  our value chain, we are developing additional  qualitative and quantitative metrics to better  capture the future cost and value of GHG  emissions abatement to inform corporate  strategy and core business decisions. \nGreen revenue \nGreen revenue is intended as a measure of  the extent to which products and services  contribute to the transition to a green   economy.  While these contributions will be  measured on a range of important indicators  (including water conservation, biodiversity  or reforestation), much of the discussion  about green revenue is focused around the  contribution to the transition to renewable  energy that is vital for climate change mitigation. \nThere is no settled methodology for classifying  green revenue in the resources sector.  In response to increased investor interest in  the concept, in FY2021 BHP reviewed potential  approaches to classification and measurement  of green revenue, starting with consideration  of how our products contribute to addressing  the challenge of climate change. \nWe expect many of our commodities to be  important to the energy transition. For example,  the International Energy Agency’s ‘The Role of  Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions’  report (2)  highlights the critical role of copper and  nickel, and BHP’s  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   scenario (3)  indicates that  the case for copper, nickel and potash could be  even more compelling as the world takes action  to decarbonise. Iron ore also fares slightly better  under our  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   scenario versus other scenarios,  as steel requirements of the energy transition  are expected to be considerable. The most  commonly used measure for green revenue is  based on end use of products. However, this  measure is not straightforward, for two reasons:\n\n \n–\t Identifying the end use of some commodities  is challenging. Copper and iron ore, in  particular, undergo multiple stages of  processing and have a diverse range  of end uses. \n\n \n–\t The way in which commodities are  produced is not captured by end use  measures. However, production methods for  the resource sector can in themselves be an  important contributor to achieving a green  economy. For example, our Chilean copper  operated asset at Escondida is on track to  have 100 per cent renewable electricity  supply by the mid-2020s and source  desalinated water for operational purposes,  minimising water extraction from sensitive  Andean aquifers. \nEnd use may therefore not be the sole  appropriate measure of products’ contribution  to the energy transition, and other measures  (such as how they are produced) may also  be useful, and even more appropriate in  some circumstances. \nIn FY2021, we have applied an approach to  green revenue based on end use, using nickel  and uranium by way of illustration. At this  stage, these are the most straightforward  of our commodities for which to determine  contribution to the energy transition from their  end use. In FY2022, we intend to continue to  consult with investors, industry and standard  setters to explore ways of establishing  clear methodologies for classification and  measurement of green revenue. We also  plan to work with our customers, suppliers  and others in our value chain to improve the  traceability of our products and the GHG  emissions produced by their use. \nBattery manufacture contributes to climate  change mitigation.  Therefore, for illustrative  purposes,  we have measured the revenue  from our sales to battery materials suppliers as  green revenue. Seventy-two per cent of   BHP’s battery-suitable nickel metal (6)  was   sold to global battery material suppliers in   FY2021.  For FY2021, BHP’s green revenue  from battery-suitable nickel metal amounted  to US\\$760 million.   \n\nAustralian uranium is sold for nuclear power  generation only, a low emissions source of  electricity, and therefore, also for illustrative  purposes, we have measured all revenue from  uranium as green revenue. For FY2021, BHP’s  green revenue from uranium amounted to  US\\$249 million.  \nCarbon offsets \nBHP’s approach to carbon offsetting is to  prioritise emission reduction projects at  our operated assets, with investments in  external carbon offset projects considered  complementary to this ‘structural abatement’.  We work with others to promote the  development of carbon market mechanisms,  particularly for natural climate solutions.  \nAlthough we prioritise our internal emission  reduction projects, we acknowledge a role  for high-quality offsets in a temporary or  transitional capacity while abatement options  are being studied, as well as for ‘hard to  abate’ emissions with limited or no current  technological solutions. \nIn FY2021, we retired 0.3 million carbon offsets  in the form of verified carbon units equivalent  to the net increase in our FY2021 operational  GHG emissions from FY2020. The offsets  were sourced from high-quality projects,  such as the Cordillera Azul National Park  REDD  $^+$  Project and the Kasigau Corridor REDD  Project,  representing additional, permanent  and otherwise unclaimed emission reductions  from activities designed to avoid contributing  to social or environmental harms. \nFor more information on how BHP manages  offsets  refer to bhp.com/offsets-2021 \nNatural climate solutions \nInvesting in natural ecosystems is a cost- effective and immediately available solution to  mitigate climate change that often provides  sustainability co-benefits, such as biodiversity  conservation, improved water quality or support  for local communities. We work to support  the development of market mechanisms that  channel private sector finance into projects  that increase carbon storage or avoid GHG  emissions through conservation, restoration  and improved management of terrestrial  landscapes, wetlands and coastal and marine  "}

We believe we are well positioned to  bring economic participation opportunities  to Indigenous communities where we operate  and through these plans, we articulate our  approach to agreement-making, Indigenous  procurement, employment and social  investment, which are core components  of our Indigenous Peoples Strategy. \nOur efforts are complementary to the BHP  Foundation’s global programs supporting  Indigenous peoples. These include the  landmark ‘10 Deserts’ project in Australia that  has enabled and supported Indigenous land  management activities across 35 per cent of  the Australian landmass, and similar projects  supporting Indigenous peoples’ participation  in the management and protection of  traditional lands in the Boreal Forest of  Canada and the Peruvian Amazon. \nMinerals Australia \nThere has been broad support and wide- ranging community efforts to further strengthen  the laws, policies and practices regulating how  Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural  heritage values are managed in Australia.

Water is also integral to what we  do and we cannot operate without it. In FY2017,  we adopted a Water Stewardship Strategy to  improve our management of water, increase  transparency and contribute to the resolution  of shared water challenges. Our Water  Stewardship Position Statement was developed  in FY2019 and outlines our 2030 vision.  \nMore information on our environmental  approach, the Our Requirements for  Environment and Climate Change standard,  and our environmental management and  governance processes is available at  bhp.com/sustainability \nContributing to a resilient  environment \nMore information is available at   bhp.com/water \nBiodiversity is essential to maintain healthy  ecosystems and the clean air, water and  productive landscapes and seascapes we  all need to survive and thrive. We are seeing  an increasing societal focus on the urgent  need to reverse current trends in biodiversity  loss, and as a global resources company,  we acknowledge we have a role to play in  contributing to environmental resilience.  We do this through our social investment  strategy and our work with strategic partners  and communities.  \nWe recognise our responsibility to effectively  manage our interactions with and minimise  our adverse impacts on water resources.  Effective water stewardship begins within  our operations. We use water in a number of  ways, including but not limited to: extracting  it for ore processing and to access ore; dust  suppression; processing mine tailings; providing  drinking water and sanitation facilities; and using  marine water for desalination. By improving  water management and stewardship within  our operations, we can more credibly  collaborate with others to find solutions for  water challenges and opportunities, including  water scarcity or high variability in water supply.  We work to identify and assess opportunities  to reduce stress on water resources as a result  of our operations and implement actions  where appropriate.  \nOur work with strategic partners, including  Conservation International, and local  communities is focused on contributing to  enduring environmental and social benefits  through biodiversity conservation and  ecosystem restoration, water stewardship  and climate change mitigation and adaptation.  Our preference is to invest in projects that  contribute to cultural, economic and community  benefits in addition to environmental resilience.  Since FY2011, we have invested more  than US\\$85 million in environmental  resilience initiatives.  \nKey opportunities identified during FY2020  and FY2021 included working with stakeholders  to identify shared water challenges through  Water Resource Situation Analysis (WRSAs)  and ongoing engagements and adoption of  new water technologies.

Here’s a breakdown:\n\n1. **What we assured:**\n   - BHP’s qualitative disclosures in specific sections of the FY21 Annual Report.\n   - BHP’s Sustainability policies and standards, and how they are documented.\n   - BHP’s identification and reporting of sustainability risks and opportunities.\n   - BHP’s systems and approaches to managing sustainability risks and opportunities.\n   - BHP’s performance in managing sustainability risks and opportunities as reported in specific sections of the FY21 Annual Report.\n   - BHP’s process for prioritizing assets for PE validation.\n   - Water stewardship reporting at the asset level.\n\n2. **What we assured it against:**\n   - Management’s own disclosed criteria and various internationally recognized standards and principles including International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Mining Principles, Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Principles, and standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).\n   - Specific ICMM Subject Matters (1-5).\n   - Minimum disclosure standards for consistent water reporting.\n\nThe purpose of this assurance is to evaluate and provide reasonable assurance over BHP's adherence to the noted criteria.\nOur Conclusions \n–\t Limited Assurance \nBased on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our  attention that suggests that BHP’s sustainability data and disclosures and asset level water stewardship disclosures reported in sections 1.12, 1.13 and 4.8 of the FY21 Annual Report have not been prepared, in all material respects, in  accordance with the Criteria defined above. \n–\t Reasonable Assurance \nIn our opinion, the Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, as reported in section 1.13.7 and 4.8.5 of the FY21 Annual Report are prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Criteria defined above. \nOur approach to conducting the Review \nEmphasis of Matter \nWe conducted our procedures in accordance with the  International Federation of Accountants' International  Standard for Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits  or Reviews of Historical Financial Information  (ISAE 3000),  the  Standard for Assurance on Greenhouse Gas Statements (ISAE 3410) and the terms of reference for this engagement  as agreed with BHP on 27 January 2021. We adapted our approach to undertaking our review  procedures in response to the COVID-19 travel restrictions  and social distancing requirements. We visited one  BHP site in person with the remaining ‘site visits’  undertaken virtually by phone and video-conference.  The performance of the year end corporate review  procedures at head office was also required to be  conducted remotely and was supported through the  use of collaboration platforms for discussions and  delivery of requested evidence. The procedures we performed were based on our  professional judgement and included, but were not limited to –\t Interviewing select corporate and site personnel to  understand the reporting process at group, business,  asset and site level, including management’s processes to identify BHP’s material issues  –\t Reviewing BHP policies and management standards  to determine alignment with the ICMM’s 10 Sustainable Development principles and position statements  –\t Checking the FY21 Annual Report to understand how BHP’s identified material risks and opportunities are  reflected within the qualitative disclosures –\t Evaluating whether the information disclosed in  the FY21 Annual Report and related disclosures is  consistent with our understanding of sustainability management and performance at BHP  \nWe draw attention to section 4.8.6 in the FY21 Annual  Report and online at bhp.com/water, in which BHP  discloses performance metrics as it relates to water  withdrawals, consumption and discharges. The collation  of water storage data during FY21 has identified  uncertainty in the water models currently used at BHP’s  Coal Assets (BMA, BMC and NSW Energy Coal). As a  result, the disclosed water performance data for the Coal  Assets is subject to estimation uncertainty but is based  on the best information available at the time of reporting.  Our conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.  \nKey responsibilities  \nEY’s responsibility and independence \nOur responsibility was to express limited and reasonable  assurance conclusions on the noted subject matter as  defined in the ‘what we assured’ column in the tables  above (Subject Matter). We were also responsible for maintaining our  independence and confirm that we have met the  requirements of the APES 110  Code of Ethics for  Professional Accountants  (including Independence  Standards) and have the required competencies and  experience to conduct this assurance engagement. \nBHP’s responsibility \nBHP’s management was responsible for selecting the  Criteria and preparing and fairly presenting information  presented and referenced in the FY21 Annual Report in  accordance with that Criteria. This responsibility includes  establishing and maintaining internal controls, adequate  records and making estimates that are reasonable in  the circumstances. \n–\t Evaluating the suitability and application of the Criteria and that the Criteria have been applied appropriately  to the Subject Matter \n\n –\t Conducting a mix of virtual and in-person site  procedures at eight BHP locations to evidence site  level data collection and reporting to Group as well as to identify completeness of reported water and  emission sources \n\n –\t Undertaking analytical procedures of the quantitative  disclosures in the FY21 Annual Report and related  online disclosures\n\n –\t Reviewing data, information or explanation about  the sustainability performance data and statements included in the FY21 Annual Report and related  online disclosures\n\n –\t Reviewing other information within the FY21 Annual Report for consistency and alignment with our  assurance subject matter\n\n –\t On a judgemental sample basis, re-performing calculations to check accuracy of claims in the  FY21 Annual Report\n\n –\t Checking the water balance for each asset and  judgementally selecting a sample of water streams  for further testing\n\n –\t On a sample basis, based on our professional  judgement, agreeing claims to source information to check accuracy and completeness of claims, which  included invoices, incident reports, meter calibration  records, and meter data\n\n –\t For our reasonable assurance of Greenhouse Gas  emissions, selecting key items and representative  sampling, based on statistical audit sampling tables and agreeing to source information to check accuracy and  completeness of performance data, which included  invoices, metre calibration records and metre data. \nWe believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and  appropriate to provide a basis for our reasonable and  limited assurance conclusions \nOther Matters \nWe have not performed assurance procedures in respect  of any information relating to prior reporting periods,  including those presented in the FY21 Annual Report,  other than sustainability data and disclosures relating  to BHP’s Annual Report for the year ended 30 June  2020. Our report does not extend to any disclosures or  assertions made by BHP relating to case studies and future  performance plans and/or strategies disclosed in the FY21  Annual Report. While we considered the effectiveness  of management’s internal controls when determining  the nature and extent of our procedures, our assurance  engagement was not designed to provide assurance on  internal controls. Our procedures did not include testing  controls or performing procedures relating to checking  aggregation or calculation of data within IT systems. \nLimited and Reasonable Assurance \nProcedures performed in a limited assurance engagement  vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than  for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently,  the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance  engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that  would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance  engagement been performed. While our procedures  performed for our reasonable assurance engagement are  of a higher level of assurance, due to the use of sampling  techniques, it is not a guarantee that it will always detect  material misstatements. \nUse of our Assurance Statement \nWe disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any  reliance on this assurance report to any persons other  than management and the directors of BHP, or for any  purpose other than that for which it was prepared.  \nThe image contains two handwritten elements.

Key focus areas include the  Group’s supply chain management and our  approach to procurement and sales. \nFor more information refer to section 1.13.9 \nHow we engage and communicate Supply chain human rights \nThe Sustainability Committee considers BHP’s  approach to policy developments in and  management of human rights. The Board and  Sustainability Committee review our approach  to managing human rights risks in the supply  chain through the discussion and approval of  our annual Modern Slavery Statement.  \nFor more information  refer to section 1.13.9 \nClimate change \nWe are engaging with our customers and  progressively with our suppliers, on opportunities  to reduce Scope 3 GHG emissions.  \nFor more information refer to section 1.13.7 \nImpact of our engagement   on decision-making, strategy  and purpose \nEmissions reduction partnerships \nWe established emissions reduction  partnerships with three major steelmakers  in China and Japan whose combined output  equates to around 10 per cent of global  steel production. \nPayment terms \nFrom 1 July 2021, BHP implemented seven- day payment terms for all small, local and  Indigenous businesses across our global  operations. The move followed positive  feedback on quicker payment terms  \nimplemented by BHP for several months  in CY2020 as a temporary COVID-19  support measure. \nEnvironment \nThe Board and its Committees consider  a range of environmental matters  throughout the year, including detailed  discussions relating to climate change,  biodiversity, water, tailings storage  facilities, rehabilitation and closure.  \nFor more information refer to section 1.13.12 \nHow we engage and communicate Climate change \nOur purpose and our strategy provide a clear  direction for our climate change strategy.  The Board and its relevant Committees consider  climate change, including the external landscape  in relation to climate risks and expectations,  progress against BHP’s climate change  commitments and our climate risk exposure.  \nFor more information  refer to section 1.13.7 \nHealth, safety, environment   \nand community (HSEC) targets \nThe Sustainability Committee receives updates  on how we are performing against our public  HSEC targets and longer-term goals, including  in relation to water and biodiversity.  \nFor more information  refer to sections 1.13.4 and 2.1.11 \nEnvironmental performance \nThe Sustainability Committee considers reports  from the HSE Officer covering environmental  performance at every meeting and reports  to the Board on its discussions. \nImpact of our engagement   on decision-making, strategy  and purpose \nClimate change commitments \nThe Board approved commitments, including  setting a medium-term target for operational  (Scope 1 and Scope 2) emissions, Scope 3  emissions goals and the link between emissions  performance and executive remuneration.  The Board considered stakeholder feedback and  views as part of its decision-making process. \nCapital allocation \nIn addressing our Scope 1 and Scope 2  emissions, as with all capital investments, we  assess and rank each decarbonisation project  through the rigour of our Capital Allocation  Framework. Achieving our Scope 1 and Scope  2 emissions reduction targets and goal ranks  alongside maintenance capital in the hierarchy  of our decisions. \nRenewable power contracts \nIn keeping with our target to reduce operational  emissions by at least 30 per cent from FY2020  levels (1)  by FY2030 and our long-term goal to  achieve net zero operational emissions by 2050,  we established renewable power contracts for  our coal operations in Queensland and nickel  operations in Western Australia.

This could increase the likelihood of\nmore significant events that can have a greater\nimpact on our business, such as social unrest\nand conflict (including war and terrorism).\n\n@ bhp.com/climate\n\nRobust risk assessment\n\nand viability statement\n\nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment\nof BHP’s emerging and principal risks,\nincluding those that could result in events\n\nor circumstances that might threaten BHP’s\nbusiness model, future performance, solvency\nor liquidity and reputation.\n\nThe Board has assessed the prospects of BHP\nover the next three years, taking into account\nour current position and principal risks.\n\nThe Board believes a three-year viability\nassessment period is appropriate for the\nfollowing reasons. BHP has a two-year budget,\na five-year plan and a longer-term life of asset\noutlook. As highlighted in the ‘Risk factors’\nsection, there is considerable uncertainty in\n\nthe external environment (which has been\namplified by the COVID-19 pandemic), including\ndue to political and policy uncertainty, evolving\nstakeholder expectations (for example, in\nrelation to the environment, climate change\nand human rights), civil unrest or reform in\nsome countries in which we operate, continued\nmarket volatility and geopolitical tensions that\ncould affect our ability to access key markets.\n\nStrategic\nReport\n\nThis could lead to changes to our regulatory\nenvironment and stakeholder expectations of\nour business, increase the risk of commodity\nprice volatility and also affect the longer-term\nsupply, demand and price of our commodities.\nThese factors result in variability in plans\n\nand budgets. A three-year period strikes an\nappropriate balance between long and short-\nterm influences on performance.\n\nThe viability assessment took into account,\namong other things:\n\n- BHP’s commodity price protocols\n- the latest funding and liquidity update\n\n- the long-dated maturity profile of BHP’s\ndebt and the maximum debt maturing\n\nin any one year\n\n- the flexibility in BHP’s capital and exploration\nexpenditure programs under the Capital\nAllocation Framework\n\n- the reserve life of BHP’s minerals assets and\nthe reserves-to-production life of BHP’s oil\nand gas assets\n\n- the Group-level material risk profile\n(including climate-related risks) and the\nmitigating actions available should particular\nrisks materialise\n\n- any actual and further anticipated impacts of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic on BHP’s two-year\nbudget and five-year plan\n\nThe Board's assessment also took into account\nreverse stress testing of the Group’s balance\nsheet to determine the additional levels of\ndebt it could support on forecast commodity\nprices, as well as the cyclical low price case\nused in monthly balance sheet stress testing.\nResults were compared against assessed\nfinancial impacts for all material risks recorded\non the Group's risk profile, enabling the Board\nto consider the resilience of the balance sheet\nin the context of identified threats.\n\nIn addition, the balance sheet was stress\ntested against three hypothetical scenarios.\nEach scenario modelled two or three\nhypothetical events, based on our principal\nrisks, occurring simultaneously towards the start\nof FY2022. Scenarios were designed without\nregard to the effectiveness of preventative\ncontrols and reflect market, operational, and\n\na combination of market and operational risks.\nThe simultaneous occurrence of all four events\nwas not considered plausible. Further details\nare set out in the table below.\n\nAnumber of our other principal risks may have\nimpacts that are embedded in these scenarios.\n\nFor example, a cyber event or attack may lead to an\noperational event, while responses of governments\nand other stakeholders to a pandemic may result\n\nin an economic slowdown and low commodity\nprice environment. For further information on our\nprincipal risks, see the ‘Risk factors’ section.\n\nWhile scenario modelling was undertaken for\n\nthe duration of BHP’s five-year plan, confidence\n\nis higher in the first three years. Stress testing\ndemonstrated the Group's balance sheet was put\nunder the greatest stress by Scenario C, which\nreflects both market and operational risks, with\nnet debt expected to increase to approximately\nUS$48 billion over FY2022 to FY2024 (assuming\ndividends would be suspended in accordance\nwith our Capital Allocation Framework). In such\ncircumstances, the Board considered that the\nGroup would have a number of further mitigating\nactions available to it which would be expected to\nallow the Group to limit net debt to approximately\nUS$30 billion over that period, including\n\ndeferral of discretionary capital expenditure and\ndivestment of certain assets.

While the impacts on BHP have  been relatively minor to date, sustained or  increased geopolitical tensions, the pandemic  and nationalist sentiment may exacerbate  the drivers of conflict, instability and unrest,  including existing inequality within and between  nations. This could increase the likelihood of  more significant events that can have a greater  impact on our business, such as social unrest  and conflict (including war and terrorism). \nbhp.com/climate \nRobust risk assessment   and viability statement \nThe Board has carried out a robust assessment  of BHP’s emerging and principal risks,  including those that could result in events  or circumstances that might threaten BHP’s  business model, future performance, solvency  or liquidity and reputation. \nThe Board has assessed the prospects of BHP  over the next three years, taking into account  our current position and principal risks. \nThe Board believes a three-year viability  assessment period is appropriate for the  following reasons. BHP has a two-year budget,  a five-year plan and a longer-term life of asset  outlook. As highlighted in the ‘Risk factors’  section, there is considerable uncertainty in  the external environment (which has been  amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic), including  due to political and policy uncertainty, evolving  stakeholder expectations (for example, in  relation to the environment, climate change  and human rights), civil unrest or reform in  some countries in which we operate, continued  market volatility and geopolitical tensions that  could affect our ability to access key markets.  \nThis could lead to changes to our regulatory  environment and stakeholder expectations of  our business, increase the risk of commodity  price volatility and also affect the longer-term  supply, demand and price of our commodities.  These factors result in variability in plans  and budgets. A three-year period strikes an  appropriate balance between long and short- term influences on performance. \nA number of our other principal risks may have  impacts that are embedded in these scenarios.  For example, a cyber event or attack may lead to an  operational event, while responses of governments  and other stakeholders to a pandemic may result  in an economic slowdown and low commodity  price environment. For further information on our  principal risks, see the ‘Risk factors’ section. \nWhile scenario modelling was undertaken for  the duration of BHP’s five-year plan, confidence  is higher in the first three years. Stress testing  demonstrated the Group’s balance sheet was put  under the greatest stress by Scenario C, which  reflects both market and operational risks, with  net debt expected to increase to approximately  US\\$48 billion over FY2022 to FY2024 (assuming  dividends would be suspended in accordance  with our Capital Allocation Framework). In such  circumstances, the Board considered that the  Group would have a number of further mitigating  actions available to it which would be expected to  allow the Group to limit net debt to approximately  US\\$30 billion over that period, including  deferral of discretionary capital expenditure and  divestment of certain assets. BHP would also  have access to US\\$5.5 billion of credit through its  revolving credit facility. These mitigating actions  would be expected to be sufficient to support  minimum investment-grade credit ratings over  FY2022 to FY2024. \nThe viability assessment took into account,  among other things:\n\n \n–\t BHP’s commodity price protocols\n\n –\t the latest funding and liquidity update\n\n –\t the long-dated maturity profile of BHP’s  debt and the maximum debt maturing  in any one year\n\n –\t the flexibility in BHP’s capital and exploration  expenditure programs under the Capital  Allocation Framework\n\n –\t the reserve life of BHP’s minerals assets and  the reserves-to-production life of BHP’s oil  and gas assets\n\n –\t the Group-level material risk profile  (including climate-related risks) and the  mitigating actions available should particular  risks materialise\n\n –\t any actual and further anticipated impacts of  the COVID-19 pandemic on BHP’s two-year  budget and five-year plan \nFor the purposes of stress testing, the Board made  certain key assumptions regarding management  of the portfolio, the alignment of production,  capital expenditure and operating expenditure  with five-year plan forecasts and the alignment  of prices with the cyclical low price case used  in monthly balance sheet stress testing. \nThe Board’s assessment also took into account  reverse stress testing of the Group’s balance  sheet to determine the additional levels of  debt it could support on forecast commodity  prices, as well as the cyclical low price case  used in monthly balance sheet stress testing.  Results were compared against assessed  financial impacts for all material risks recorded  on the Group’s risk profile, enabling the Board  to consider the resilience of the balance sheet  in the context of identified threats.  \nIn making this viability statement, the Board was  also mindful of other relevant factors, including  key risk indicator performance, monthly balance  sheet stress testing against the cyclical low price  case, the assessment of the Group’s portfolio  against scenarios as part of BHP’s strategy and  corporate planning processes, a Board-level  risk identification session to help identify key  uncertainties facing the Group, and the proposed  changes to the Group’s portfolio which are  currently expected to complete in FY2022. \nIn addition, the balance sheet was stress  tested against three hypothetical scenarios.  Each scenario modelled two or three  hypothetical events, based on our principal  risks, occurring simultaneously towards the start  of FY2022. Scenarios were designed without  regard to the effectiveness of preventative  controls and reflect market, operational, and  a combination of market and operational risks.  The simultaneous occurrence of all four events  was not considered plausible. Further details  are set out in the table below. \nTaking account of these matters (including  the assumptions) and our current position  and principal risks, the Board has a reasonable  expectation that BHP will be able to continue  in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall  due over the next three years. \nThe table outlines potential hypothetical events under three principal risks: \n\n1. **Operational events:**\n   - Offshore well blowout involving a drilling rig in the US Gulf of Mexico. This risk is applicable to Scenarios A, B, and C.\n   - Catastrophic failure of a tailings storage facility in Australia. This risk is applicable to Scenario B.\n\n2. **Accessing key markets:**\n   - Temporary physical/logistical disruption to access preventing sale/delivery of commodities to Asia. This risk is applicable to Scenarios A and C.\n\n3. **Optimising portfolio returns and managing commodity price movements:**\n   - Low commodity price environment for two years starting in the second half of FY2022, followed by a gradual recovery by the first half of FY2026. This risk is applicable to Scenarios A and C."}

Iron ore prices\nwere elevated throughout FY2021, hitting record\nhighs in the second half. Forces contributing\n\nto price gains included strong Chinese pig iron\nproduction, a rapid recovery in global markets\nexcluding China and a shortage of branded fines\nproducts as some iron ore mining companies\nhave been producing towards their lower\n\nend of guidance. Medium term, we believe\nChina's demand for iron ore is expected to be\nlower than it is today as crude steel production\nplateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the\nlong term, we believe prices are expected to\n\nbe determined by high cost production, on\n\na value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia\n\nor Brazil. Quality differentiation is expected to\nremain a factor in determining iron ore prices as\nsteelmakers prefer high-quality raw materials for\nhigher productivity and lower-emissions intensity.\n\nProduction\n\nTotal Iron Ore production increased by 2 per\ncent to 254 Mt.\n\nWAIO production increased by 1 per cent\n\nto arecord 252 Mt (284 Mt on a 100% basis)\nreflecting record production at Jimblebar and\nMining Area C, which included first ore from\nSouth Flank in May 2021. This was combined\nwith strong operational performance across\nthe supply chain reflecting continued\nimprovements in car dumper performance\nand reliability, and improved train cycle times.\nThis was achieved despite significant weather\n\nimpacts, temporary rail labour shortages due\nto COVID-19 related border restrictions and\nthe planned Mining Area C and South Flank\nmajor tie-in activity to integrate South Flank\nwith the Mining Area C processing hub.\n\nSamarco production was 1.9 Mt following the\nrecommencement of iron ore pellet production\nat one concentrator in December 2020.\n\nFor more information on individual\n\nasset production in FY2021, FY2020\n\nand FY2019\n\nrefer to section 4.5\n\nFinancial results\n\nTotal Iron Ore revenue increased by\n\nUS$13.7 billion to US$34.5 billion in FY2021\nreflecting higher average realised prices and\nproduction.

Higher volumes\nincreased Underlying EBITDA by US$148 million.\nThis was partially offset by unfavourable\n\nforeign exchange impacts of US$416 million.\nOther items such as inflation and one-off items\nnegatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by\nUS$63 million.\n\nWAIO unit costs increased by 17 per cent to\nUS$14.82 per tonne due to the impact of a\n\n12 per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher\nthird-party royalties related to higher iron ore\nprices, incremental costs relating to the ramp-\nup of South Flank and higher labour costs\nrelating to increased planned maintenance\npartially offset by record production and\ncontinued production improvements across\nthe supply chain.

The calculation of Escondida unit costs is  set out in the table below:\n\n \nThe table provides financial data for Escondida in FY2020 and FY2021, including:\n\n- **Revenue**: $9,470M (FY2021) and $6,719M (FY2020)\n- **Underlying EBITDA**: $6,483M (FY2021) and $3,535M (FY2020)\n- **Gross costs**: $2,987M (FY2021) and $3,184M (FY2020)\n- **Less: by-product credits**: $478M (FY2021) and $407M (FY2020)\n- **Less: freight**: $162M (FY2021) and $178M (FY2020)\n- **Net costs**: $2,347M (FY2021) and $2,599M (FY2020)\n- **Sales (kt)**: 1,066 (FY2021) and 1,164 (FY2020)\n- **Sales (Mlb)**: 2,350 (FY2021) and 2,567 (FY2020)\n- **Cost per pound (US$)**: $1.00 (FY2021) and $1.01 (FY2020)\n(1)\t FY2021 based on average exchange rates of USD/CLP 746.\n\n (2) \t FY2021 excludes COVID-19-related costs of US\\$0.03  per pound that are reported as exceptional items.\n\n \n(3)\t FY2021 includes a (one off) gain from the optimised  outcome from renegotiation of cancelled power  contracts of US\\$0.04 per pound. \nOutlook \nWe expect the operating environment across  our Chilean assets to remain challenging, with  reductions in our on-site workforce expected  to continue in FY2022. \nTotal Copper production of between  1,590 and 1,760 kt is expected in FY2022.  Escondida production of between 1,000 and  1,080 kt is expected in FY2022, reflecting  a continuing need to catch up on mine  development due to reduced material movement  in FY2021, as well as uncertainty around  COVID-19 impacts. Decline in the copper grade  of concentrator feed in FY2022 is expected  to be approximately 2 per cent. Production at  Pampa Norte is expected to increase by more  than 50 per cent to be between 330 and 370 kt  in FY2022, reflecting the continued ramp-up  of the Spence Growth Option (SGO), partially  offset by an expected decline in stacking feed  grade at Pampa Norte of approximately 9 per  cent. The ramp-up to full production capacity  at SGO is still expected to take approximately  12 months from first production in December  2020, following which Spence is currently  planned to average 300 ktpa of production  (including cathodes) over the first four years  of operation. At Olympic Dam, production  is expected to be between 140 and 170 kt in  FY2022 as a result of the planned major smelter  maintenance campaign and subsequent ramp- up planned between August 2021 and February  2022. Antamina Copper production is expected  between 120 and 140 kt in FY2022.  \nEscondida unit costs in FY2022 are expected to  be between US\\$1.20 and US\\$1.40 per pound  (based on an average exchange rate of USD/ CLP 727) reflecting expected lower by-product  credits, expected higher costs associated with  an approximately 20 per cent increase in material  mined required to catch up on mine development  due to reduced material movement in FY2021 and  study costs to increase optionality at Escondida  longer term. This also reflects the inclusion of  COVID-19 costs (treated as an exceptional item in  FY2021) and a further decline in concentrator feed  grade of approximately 2 per cent. In the medium  term, unit cost guidance remains unchanged  at less than US\\$1.10 per pound (based on an  exchange rate of USD/CLP 727). \n\n1.17.3   Iron Ore \nDetailed below is financial and operating  information for our Iron Ore assets comparing  FY2021 to FY2020.  \nThe table presents financial and production data for a company for the years ending on June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020. The figures are provided in USD million (US$M) unless otherwise stated. Here are the key data points from the table:\n\n- **Revenue**: $34,475 million in 2021, up from $20,797 million in 2020.\n- **Underlying EBITDA**: $26,278 million in 2021, up from $14,554 million in 2020.\n- **Net operating assets**: $18,663 million in 2021, compared to $18,400 million in 2020.\n- **Capital expenditure**: $2,188 million in 2021, down from $2,328 million in 2020.\n- **Total iron ore production**: 254 million tonnes (Mt) in 2021, up from 248 Mt in 2020.\n- **Average realised prices for iron ore**:\n  - Iron ore (US$/wmt, FOB): $130.56 in 2021, up from $77.36 in 2020.\n\nThis table highlights significant improvements in revenue, underlying EBITDA, and average iron ore prices from 2020 to 2021.\nKey drivers of Iron Ore’s   financial results \nPrice overview \nIron Ore’s average realised sales price for FY2021  was US\\$130.56 per wet metric tonne (wmt)  (FY2020: US\\$77.36 per wmt). Iron ore prices  were elevated throughout FY2021, hitting record  highs in the second half. Forces contributing  to price gains included strong Chinese pig iron  production, a rapid recovery in global markets  excluding China and a shortage of branded fines  products as some iron ore mining companies  have been producing towards their lower  end of guidance. Medium term, we believe  China’s demand for iron ore is expected to be  lower than it is today as crude steel production  plateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the  long term, we believe prices are expected to  be determined by high cost production, on  a value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia  or Brazil. Quality differentiation is expected to  remain a factor in determining iron ore prices as  steelmakers prefer high-quality raw materials for  higher productivity and lower-emissions intensity.  \nProduction \nTotal Iron Ore production increased by 2 per  cent to 254 Mt. \nWAIO production increased by 1 per cent  to a record 252 Mt (284 Mt on a   $100\\%$   basis)  reflecting record production at Jimblebar and  Mining Area C, which included first ore from  South Flank in May 2021. This was combined  with strong operational performance across  the supply chain reflecting continued  improvements in car dumper performance  and reliability, and improved train cycle times.  This was achieved despite significant weather  impacts, temporary rail labour shortages due  to COVID-19 related border restrictions and  the planned Mining Area C and South Flank  major tie-in activity to integrate South Flank  with the Mining Area C processing hub.  \n\nSamarco production was 1.9 Mt following the  recommencement of iron ore pellet production  at one concentrator in December 2020.  \nFor more information on individual  asset production in FY2021, FY2020  and FY2019 \nFinancial results \nTotal Iron Ore revenue increased by  US\\$13.7 billion to US\\$34.5 billion in FY2021  reflecting higher average realised prices and  production. Underlying EBITDA for Iron Ore  increased by US\\$11.7 billion to   $\\cup S\\Phi26.3$  billion  including favourable price impacts, net of price- linked costs, of US\\$12.1 billion. Higher volumes  increased Underlying EBITDA by US\\$148 million.  This was partially offset by unfavourable  foreign exchange impacts of US\\$416 million.  Other items such as inflation and one-off items  negatively impacted Underlying EBITDA by  US\\$63 million.  \nWAIO unit costs increased by 17 per cent to  US\\$14.82 per tonne due to the impact of a  12 per cent stronger Australian dollar, higher  third-party royalties related to higher iron ore  prices, incremental costs relating to the ramp- up of South Flank and higher labour costs  relating to increased planned maintenance  partially offset by record production and  continued production improvements across  the supply chain. The calculation of WAIO  unit costs is set out in the table below:\n\n \nThe table presents the WAIO unit costs in US dollars for the fiscal years 2021 and 2020. Here's a breakdown of the data:\n\n- **Revenue**: \n  - FY2021: $34,337 million\n  - FY2020: $20,663 million\n\n- **Underlying EBITDA**: \n  - FY2021: $26,270 million\n  - FY2020: $14,508 million\n\n- **Gross costs**: \n  - FY2021: $8,067 million\n  - FY2020: $6,155 million\n\n- **Less: freight**: \n  - FY2021: $1,755 million\n  - FY2020: $1,459 million\n\n- **Less: royalties**: \n  - FY2021: $2,577 million\n  - FY2020: $1,531 million\n\n- **Net costs**: \n  - FY2021: $3,735 million\n  - FY2020: $3,165 million\n\n- **Sales (kt, equity share)**: \n  - FY2021: 252,052 kt\n  - FY2020: 250,598 kt\n\n- **Cost per tonne (US$)**: \n  - FY2021: $14.82\n  - FY2020: $12.63\n\nThese figures provide a comparison of financial performance for WAIO (Western Australia Iron Ore) unit costs between the two fiscal years.\n(1)\t FY2021 based on an average exchange rate of   AUD/USD 0.75.\n\n (2)\t FY2021 excludes COVID-19 related costs of US\\$0.51 per  tonne (including US\\$0.25 per tonne relating to operations  and US\\$0.26 per tonne of demurrage) that are reported as  exceptional items. An additional US\\$0.12 per tonne relating  to capital projects is also reported as an exceptional item. \nOutlook \nWAIO production of between 246 and 255 Mt,  or between 278 and 288 Mt on a 100 per cent  basis, is expected in FY2022 as WAIO looks to  focus on incremental volume growth through  productivity improvements. We continue with  our program to further improve port reliability  and this includes a major maintenance  campaign on car dumper one planned for the  September 2021 quarter. The Yandi resource has  commenced its end-of-life ramp-down as South  Flank ramps up, and this is expected to continue  to provide supply chain flexibility with a lower  level of production to continue for a few years. \nSamarco production of between 3 and 4 Mt  (BHP share) is expected in FY2022.

Under deep\ndecarbonisation scenarios, demand is expected\nto decline in absolute terms.\n\nProduction\n\nMetallurgical coal production decreased by\n\n1 per cent to 41 Mt (73 Mt ona 100 per cent\n\nbasis). At Queensland Coal strong operational\nperformance, including record production at\nGoonyella facilitated by record tonnes from\nBroadmeadow mine, was offset by significant\nweather impacts across most operations\n\nearlier in the year, as well as planned wash plant\nmaintenance at Saraji and Caval Ridge in the first\nhalf of the year.

The commodities considered are oil, copper, iron ore, metallurgical coal, energy coal, and nickel, with their respective impacts measured per unit increase in price:\n\n- A US$1 per barrel increase in the oil price impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million.\n- A US¢1 per pound increase in the copper price impacts profit after taxation by $23 million and underlying EBITDA by $33 million.\n- A US$1 per ton increase in the iron ore price impacts profit after taxation by $163 million and underlying EBITDA by $233 million.\n- A US$1 per ton increase in the metallurgical coal price impacts profit after taxation by $24 million and underlying EBITDA by $35 million.\n- A US$1 per ton increase in the energy coal price impacts profit after taxation by $9 million and underlying EBITDA by $13 million.\n- A US¢1 per pound increase in the nickel price impacts both profit after taxation and underlying EBITDA by $1 million.\nLonger term, we believe that nickel will  be a substantial beneficiary of the global  electrification mega-trend and that nickel  sulphides will be particularly attractive.  This is due to their relatively lower cost of  production of battery-suitable class-1 nickel  than for laterites, and the favourable position  of integrated sulphide operations on the  emission intensity curve. \n1.18   Other information \n1.18.1   Company details  and terms of reference \nBHP Group Limited is registered in Australia.

BHP cautions against  reliance on any forward-looking statements  or guidance, including in light of the current  economic climate and the significant volatility,  uncertainty and disruption arising in connection  with COVID-19. \nFor example, our future revenues from  our assets, projects or mines described  in this Annual Report will be based, in  part, on the market price of the minerals,  metals or petroleum produced, which  may vary significantly from current levels.  These variations, if materially adverse, may  affect the timing or the feasibility of the  development of a particular project, the  expansion of certain facilities or mines, or  the continuation of existing assets. \nOther factors that may affect the actual  construction or production commencement  dates, revenues, costs or production output  and anticipated lives of assets, mines or  facilities include:  \n(i) our ability to profitably produce and transport  the minerals, petroleum and/or metals extracted  to applicable markets;  \n(ii) the impact of foreign currency exchange  rates on the market prices of the minerals,  petroleum or metals we produce; \n(iii) activities of government authorities in the  countries where we sell our products and in the  countries where we are exploring or developing  projects, facilities or mines, including increases  in taxes;  \n(iv) changes in environmental and  other regulations; \n\n \n(v) the duration and severity of the COVID-19 \n\n \n(vi) political or geopolitical uncertainty; \n\n \n(viii) other factors identified in the risk factors  set out in section 1.16. \nExcept as required by applicable regulations  or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly  update or review any forward-looking  statements, whether as a result of new  information or future events. \nPast performance cannot be relied on  as a guide to future performance. \nEmissions and energy  consumption data  \nDue to the inherent uncertainty and limitations  in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  and operational energy consumption under  the calculation methodologies used in the  preparation of such data, all GHG emissions  and operational energy consumption data or  references to GHG emissions and operational  energy consumption volumes (including  ratios or percentages) in this Annual Report  are estimates. There may also be differences  in the manner that third parties calculate or  report GHG emissions or operational energy  consumption data compared to BHP, which  means that third party data may not be  comparable to our data.

This approach also ensures a coordinated process on succession planning, Board renewal, training and development and\nCommittee composition. These processes are all relevant to the Nomination and Governance Committee's role in identifying appropriate Non-\nexecutive Director candidates.\n\nIndependence\nThe Board is committed to ensuring a majority of Directors are independent.\n\nThe Board has adopted a policy that it uses to determine the independence of its Directors. This determination is carried out upon appointment,\nannually and at any other time where the change in circumstances of a Director warrant reconsideration. The Board confirms that it considers all of the\ncurrent Non-executive Directors, including the Chair, to be independent of management and free from any business relationship or other circumstance\nthat could materially interfere with the exercise of objective, unfettered or independent judgement.\n\nAcopy of the policy on Independence of Directors is available at\nbhp.com/governance\n\nTenure\n\nAt the end of FY2021, Malcolm Broomhead, who was appointed in March 2010, had served on the Board for more than nine years. In light of the\nretirement of both Susan Kilsby and Anita Frew at the end of the 2021 AGMs, the Board has requested that Mr Broomhead seek re-election at the 2021\nAGMs for a further year. Mr Broomhead would step down from the Sustainability Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee following the\nAGMs but remain on the Board. The Board supports Mr Broomhead’s re-election given his extensive knowledge of BHP and the mining and resources\nsector and the proposed corporate transaction that the Group is undertaking at this time. The Board does not believe his tenure interferes with his\nability to act in the best interests of BHP. The Board believes he continues to demonstrate strong independence of character and judgement, and has\nnot formed associations with management (or others) that might compromise his ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests\nof the Group. The Board has been undergoing a process of renewal and, recognising the importance of continuity on the Board and Mr Broomhead's\nexpertise, considers his continued service to be in the best interests of shareholders.\n\nRelationships and associations\n\nSome of the Directors hold or have previously held positions in companies that BHP has commercial relationships with. Those positions and companies\nare listed in the Director profiles in section 2.1.2 and in past Annual Reports. The Board has assessed the relationships between the Group and the\ncompanies in which our Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors’ exercise of\nobjective, unfettered or independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\nFor example, Mr Broomhead was a Director of Orica Limited (a company BHP has commercial dealings with) during FY2021, and Mr Cockerill was also\na Director of Orica until August 2019. Orica provides commercial explosives, blasting systems and mineral processing chemicals and services to the\nmining and resources industry, among others. Mr Cockerill was appointed to the Orica Board in 2010 (prior to his appointment to the BHP Board) and\nMr Broomhead was appointed to the Orica Board in 2016 (after his appointment to the BHP Board). At the time of Mr Broomhead’s appointment to the\nBoard of Orica, and at the time of Mr Cockerill’s appointment to the Board of BHP, the BHP Board assessed the relationship between BHP and Orica\nand determined (and remains satisfied) that Mr Broomhead and Mr Cockerill were (and Mr Broomhead remains during FY2021) able to apply objective,\nunfettered and independent judgement and to act in the best interests of BHP.\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nBHP Group Plc’s Articles of Association allow the Directors to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate. A procedure operates\n\nto ensure the disclosure of conflicts and for the consideration and, if appropriate, the authorisation of those conflicts by non-conflicted Directors.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee supports the Board in this process by reviewing requests from Directors for authorisation of situations\n\nof actual or potential conflict and making recommendations to the Board. It also regularly reviews any situations of actual or potential conflict that have\npreviously been authorised by the Board and makes recommendations on whether the authorisation remains appropriate. In addition, in accordance\nwith Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration where a Director has a material personal interest, the affected Director takes no part in decision-\nmaking unless authorised by non-interested Directors. Provisions for Directors’ interests are set out in the Constitution of BHP Group Limited.\n\n86 | BHP | AnnualReport 2021\n", "vlm_text": "The table outlines activities and purposes related to \"Briefings and development sessions\" and \"Site visits\" during FY2021.

Mr Broomhead would step down from the Sustainability Committee and Nomination and Governance Committee following the  AGMs but remain on the Board. The Board supports Mr Broomhead’s re-election given his extensive knowledge of BHP and the mining and resources  sector and the proposed corporate transaction that the Group is undertaking at this time. The Board does not believe his tenure interferes with his  ability to act in the best interests of BHP. The Board believes he continues to demonstrate strong independence of character and judgement, and has  not formed associations with management (or others) that might compromise his ability to exercise independent judgement or act in the best interests  of the Group. The Board has been undergoing a process of renewal and, recognising the importance of continuity on the Board and Mr Broomhead’s  expertise, considers his continued service to be in the best interests of shareholders.  \nRelationships and associations \nSome of the Directors hold or have previously held positions in companies that BHP has commercial relationships with. Those positions and companies  are listed in the Director profiles in section 2.1.2 and in past Annual Reports. The Board has assessed the relationships between the Group and the  companies in which our Directors hold or held positions and has concluded that the relationships do not interfere with the Directors’ exercise of  objective, unfettered or independent judgement or their ability to act in the best interests of BHP.  \nFor example, Mr Broomhead was a Director of Orica Limited (a company BHP has commercial dealings with) during FY2021, and Mr Cockerill was also  a Director of Orica until August 2019. Orica provides commercial explosives, blasting systems and mineral processing chemicals and services to the  mining and resources industry, among others. Mr Cockerill was appointed to the Orica Board in 2010 (prior to his appointment to the BHP Board) and  Mr Broomhead was appointed to the Orica Board in 2016 (after his appointment to the BHP Board). At the time of Mr Broomhead’s appointment to the  Board of Orica, and at the time of Mr Cockerill’s appointment to the Board of BHP, the BHP Board assessed the relationship between BHP and Orica  and determined (and remains satisfied) that Mr Broomhead and Mr Cockerill were (and Mr Broomhead remains during FY2021) able to apply objective,  unfettered and independent judgement and to act in the best interests of BHP.  \nConflicts of interest \nBHP Group Plc’s Articles of Association allow the Directors to authorise conflicts and potential conflicts where appropriate. A procedure operates  to ensure the disclosure of conflicts and for the consideration and, if appropriate, the authorisation of those conflicts by non-conflicted Directors.  The Nomination and Governance Committee supports the Board in this process by reviewing requests from Directors for authorisation of situations  of actual or potential conflict and making recommendations to the Board. It also regularly reviews any situations of actual or potential conflict that have  previously been authorised by the Board and makes recommendations on whether the authorisation remains appropriate. In addition, in accordance  with Australian law, if a situation arises for consideration where a Director has a material personal interest, the affected Director takes no part in decision- making unless authorised by non-interested Directors. Provisions for Directors’ interests are set out in the Constitution of BHP Group Limited. "}

As part of this evaluation, the RAC considers specified criteria, including delivering value to shareholders and BHP, and also assesses the adequacy  of the external audit process with emphasis on quality, effectiveness and performance. It does so through a range of means, including:\n\n \n–\t the Committee considers the External Audit Plan, in particular to gain assurance that it is tailored to reflect changes in circumstances from the  prior year\n\n –\t throughout the year, the Committee meets with the audit partners, particularly the lead Australian and UK audit engagement partners, without  management present\n\n –\t following the completion of the audit, the Committee considers the quality of the External Auditor’s performance drawing on survey results.  The survey is based on a two-way feedback model where the BHP and EY teams assess each other against a range of criteria. The criteria against  which the BHP team evaluates EY’s performance include ethics and integrity, insight, service quality, communication, reporting and responsiveness\n\n –\t reviewing the terms of engagement of the External Auditor\n\n –\t discussing with the audit engagement partners the skills and experience of the broader audit team\n\n –\t reviewing audit quality inspection reports on EY published by the UK Financial Reporting Council in considering the effectiveness of the audit \nIn addition, the RAC reviews the integrity, independence and objectivity of the External Auditor and assesses whether there is any element of the  relationship that impairs or appears to impair the External Auditor’s judgement or independence. The External Auditor also certifies its independence  to the RAC. \nNon-audit services \nAlthough the External Auditor does provide some non-audit services, the objectivity and independence of the External Auditor are safeguarded  through restrictions on the provision of these services with some services prohibited from being undertaken. \nPre-approved services \nThe RAC has adopted a policy entitled ‘Provision of Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor’ covering the RAC’s pre-approval policies and  procedures to maintain the independence of the External Auditor, which reflects the requirements for External Auditors contained in the Ethical  Standards published by the UK Financial Reporting Council.  \nThe categories of ‘pre-approved’ services are:\n\n \n–\t Audit services – work that constitutes the agreed scope of the statutory audit and includes the statutory audits of BHP and its entities (including  interim reviews). This category also includes work that is reasonably related to the performance of an audit or review and is a logical extension of  the audit or review scope. The RAC monitors the audit services engagements and if necessary, approves any changes in terms and conditions  resulting from changes in audit scope, Group structure or other relevant events.\n\n \n–\t Audit-related and other assurance services – work that is outside the scope of the statutory audit but is consistent with the role of the external  statutory auditor, is of an assurance or compliance nature, is work the External Auditor must or is best placed to undertake and is permissible  under the relevant applicable standard.

This results in some\ncomplexity in our disclosures, as there are some key differences in the requirements and the information that must be disclosed. For example, UK\nrequirements give shareholders the right to a binding vote on the remuneration policy every three years and as a result, the remuneration policy\nneeds to be described in a separate section in the Remuneration Report. Our remuneration policy is set out in section 2.2.2. In Australia, BHP is\nrequired to make certain disclosures for KMP as defined by the Australian Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and IFRS.\n\nThe UK requirements focus on the remuneration of Executive and Non-executive Directors. At BHP this is our Board, including the CEO, who is\nour sole Executive Director. In contrast, the Australian requirements focus on the remuneration of KMP, defined as those who have authority and\nresponsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly.

This results in some  complexity in our disclosures, as there are some key differences in the requirements and the information that must be disclosed. For example, UK  requirements give shareholders the right to a binding vote on the remuneration policy every three years and as a result, the remuneration policy  needs to be described in a separate section in the Remuneration Report. Our remuneration policy is set out in section 2.2.2. In Australia, BHP is  required to make certain disclosures for KMP as defined by the Australian Corporations Act 2001, Australian Accounting Standards and IFRS.  \nThe UK requirements focus on the remuneration of Executive and Non-executive Directors. At BHP, this is our Board, including the CEO, who is  our sole Executive Director. In contrast, the Australian requirements focus on the remuneration of KMP, defined as those who have authority and  responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the Group directly or indirectly. KMP includes the Board, as well as certain  members of our senior executive team.  \nAfter due consideration, the Committee has determined the KMP for FY2021 comprised the following roles: all Non-executive Directors, the CEO,  the Chief Financial Officer, the President Minerals Australia, the President Minerals Americas, and the President Petroleum. \nThe following individuals have held their positions and were KMP for the whole of FY2021, unless stated otherwise: \n–\t Mike Henry, CEO and Executive Director  –\t Edgar Basto, President Minerals Australia  –\t Peter Beaven, Chief Financial Officer (to 30 November 2020) –\t David Lamont, Chief Financial Officer (from 1 December 2020) –\t Daniel Malchuk, President Minerals Americas (to 31 October 2020) –\t Geraldine Slattery, President Petroleum –\t Ragnar Udd, President Minerals Americas (from 1 November 2020) –\t Non-executive Directors – see ‘Remuneration for Non-executive Directors’ in section 2.2.3 for details of the Non-executive Directors, including  dates of appointment or cessation (where relevant) \nThe table is a list of abbreviations and their corresponding items.

While the emergence and deployment of successful\nvaccines is reason for optimism, the pandemic continues to have widespread impacts on lives, society and the global economy. In the face of this,\nBHP employees have operated in line with our purpose and values, working effectively to keep the business performing strongly, and keeping each\nother safe.\n\nOur approach\n\nOur Charter sets out our values, placing health and safety first, upon which the Remuneration Committee places great weight in the determination of\nperformance-based remuneration outcomes for BHP executives. Our Charter also sets out our purpose, our strategy and how we measure success\nThe Committee is guided by Our Charter and aims to support our executives in taking a long-term approach to decision-making in order to build a\nsustainable and value-adding business.\n\nThe Committee is focused on having and applying a remuneration policy and approach that supports the Group’s strategy and enables us to attract,\nretain and motivate the executives in different geographies critical to delivering the best outcomes for all BHP stakeholders. In addition, as BHP is a\nglobal organisation, the Committee is cognisant of the need to navigate the priorities and expectations of multiple jurisdictions.\n\nOur policy and approach to remuneration remains unchanged; however, we continue to strive for simplification in our programs. We were pleased\nto again receive strong support for our remuneration policy at the 2020 AGMs, with over 95 per cent voting ‘for’ the Remuneration Report, and, on\naverage, over 96 per cent support over the past five years. The Committee and the Board continue to incorporate shareholder feedback into our\ndeliberations on pay to ensure it supports BHP’s strategy.\n\nRemuneration policy\n\nFY2021 represents the second year of application of the revised remuneration policy, which was approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs with\nalmost 94 per cent of votes in favour. We believe the policy is serving stakeholders well. The key changes approved in 2019 for the CEO, which took\neffect from 1 July 2019, were:\n\n- achange in the balance of incentive arrangements comprising:\n\n- asignificantly reduced LTIP grant size of 200 per cent of base salary (on a face value basis), down from 400 per cent\n\n= arebalancing to a CDP award with a longer term focus than the former STIP. The CDP outcome is delivered one-third as a cash award, with two-\nthirds delivered in equity, as two-year and five-year deferred share awards each of equivalent value to the cash award. This aligns participants’\nincentive remuneration with performance over the short, medium and long-term\n\n= this rebalancing from LTIP to CDP reduced the leverage in the overall pay arrangements resulting in a 12 per cent reduction in the maximum\nremuneration for a year\n\n- asignificant reduction in the pension contribution rate to 10 per cent of base salary, down from 25 per cent (noting the estimated workforce average\nis approximately 11.5 per cent of base salary). As a result of this change, fixed remuneration for the CEO role was reduced by 12 per cent and overall\ntarget remuneration reduced by 4 per cent\n\n- the introduction of a two-year post-retirement shareholding requirement for the CEO\n\nAconsequence of the transition to the revised remuneration policy is that the FY2021 single total figure of remuneration for the CEO under UK\nrequirements requires disclosure of the total amount of the CDP award earned during FY2021 (i.e. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award\nare deferred and five-year deferred shares were not a feature of the former STIP), together with the full amount of the pre-existing LTIP award vesting\nat the end of FY2021, which was granted in 2016 when the CEO was President Operations, Minerals Australia (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double\nthe current grant size). This legacy consequence of remuneration policy transition will continue each year through to FY2024.\n\nThe Committee strives to implement the remuneration policy in a considered way. We test the CEO’s remuneration against CEO roles in other global\ncompanies of similar complexity, size, reach and industry. The remuneration also reflects the CEO’s responsibilities, location, skills, performance,\nqualifications and experience. This detailed benchmarking ensures BHP’s executive remuneration packages are competitive enough to attract and\nretain talented executives, without being excessive. External benchmarking shows the CEO's target remuneration package is below the average for\nsimilar global companies. Importantly, a significant portion of the CEO's target remuneration package can only be realised as actual remuneration\n\nif performance targets are met.\n\nIn addition, the CEO's remuneration is deliberately tied to the performance of the business, with the majority of the remuneration package intended\nto be delivered in BHP equity, not cash. The CEO also has a minimum shareholding requirement of five times pre-tax base salary, which continues\nfor two years post-retirement.

Despite this, as occurred in FY2020, there were costs and other impacts of COVID-19 to BHP’s financial results for\nFY2021. The direct costs have been recorded as an exceptional item in the Financial Statements, as they were in FY2020. Nevertheless, the Committee\nconcluded that, to the extent the COVID-19 related costs were higher than those included in the approved budget, they should flow through to the\nfinancial measures for CDP scorecard purposes, thereby reducing the remuneration outcome for executives from what they would have otherwise\nbeen. The Committee considered this was appropriate in light of the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDP outcome for the financial\nmeasure was 60 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent.\n\nThe Committee also considered Mike's performance against his individual objectives. These included projects and initiatives in respect of performance\n(material improvement in the system that supports exceptional performance), social value (long-term growth in value and returns for all stakeholders),\npeople (right people, right skills, coming together in the right way to support exceptional performance) and portfolio (progress on our strategic\nobjectives to create a winning portfolio and set BHP up for the next 20 years). The Committee considered Mike's performance against his individual\nobjectives to be in line with the target of 25 per cent.\n\nWhile the CEO’s CDP scorecard outcome was determined at 115 per cent of target, the CDP scorecard outcomes for other Executive KMP were also\non average ahead of target.

Despite this, as occurred in FY2020, there were costs and other impacts of COVID-19 to BHP’s financial results for  FY2021. The direct costs have been recorded as an exceptional item in the Financial Statements, as they were in FY2020. Nevertheless, the Committee  concluded that, to the extent the COVID-19 related costs were higher than those included in the approved budget, they should flow through to the  financial measures for CDP scorecard purposes, thereby reducing the remuneration outcome for executives from what they would have otherwise  been. The Committee considered this was appropriate in light of the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CDP outcome for the financial  measure was 60 per cent out of a target of 50 per cent. \nThe Committee also considered Mike’s performance against his individual objectives. These included projects and initiatives in respect of performance  (material improvement in the system that supports exceptional performance), social value (long-term growth in value and returns for all stakeholders),  people (right people, right skills, coming together in the right way to support exceptional performance) and portfolio (progress on our strategic  objectives to create a winning portfolio and set BHP up for the next 20 years). The Committee considered Mike’s performance against his individual  objectives to be in line with the target of 25 per cent. \nWhile the CEO’s CDP scorecard outcome was determined at 115 per cent of target, the CDP scorecard outcomes for other Executive KMP were also  on average ahead of target. Likewise, the short-term incentive pool applicable to the majority of BHP employees below the ELT level was above target.  These outcomes were considered appropriate and due recognition, given the excellent performance across BHP’s whole workforce in the face of the  continuing COVID-19 pandemic, where strong safety performance and operational continuity were achieved during FY2021.  \n2016 LTIP award \nThe vesting outcome for the 2016 LTIP award against the relative TSR performance conditions was 100 per cent. BHP outperformed both the sector  peer group and the MSCI World Index significantly. This 100 per cent level of vesting is aligned with the projected vesting outcome communicated  to shareholders in the 2019 Remuneration Report at the time of the changes to our remuneration policy, which were approved by shareholders at  the 2019 AGMs, and is set out in the chart below.  \nThe image is a bar chart titled \"LTIP vesting\" which illustrates the percentage of actual and projected vesting for various years from 2009 to 2021.\n\n- The x-axis represents the vesting year.\n- The y-axis represents the percentage of vesting, ranging from 0% to 100%.\n\nKey insights include:\n\n- **2009 to 2012:** 100% actual vesting each year.\n- **2013:** 65% actual vesting, with 35% discretion used.\n- **2014:** 58% actual vesting.\n- **2015 to 2019:** 0% vesting each year.\n- **2020:** 48% actual vesting, with a projected 70% perceived.\n- **2021:** 100% actual and projected vesting.\n\nThe chart uses orange to indicate actual vesting, light orange for discretion used, and gray for projected vesting.\nAs shareholders will recall, one of the key elements of our revised remuneration policy was to reduce the weighting of future LTIP grants as part of the  overall CEO remuneration package; however, pre-existing grants would stay on foot and their vesting would be determined with existing service and  performance conditions. \nThe Committee is conscious that the granting of the 2016 LTIP awards and the early part of the five-year performance period coincided with a period  of lower share prices, driven in part by the Samarco dam failure having occurred on 5 November 2015.  \nAt the time of the grant of the 2016 LTIP award, the Committee sought to ensure the Samarco dam failure did not result in an inappropriate LTIP award  size due to the lower share price, and reduced the number of awards by 26 per cent from that which would have resulted from the standard grant  size calculation. The Committee has reviewed this approach and concluded it was appropriate. In reaching this conclusion, the Committee noted  the positive feedback received from shareholders and other investor groups in 2016 on the approach adopted. \nHaving considered the LTIP grant size, the Committee undertook a further exercise to satisfy itself that the TSR performance, which formulaically would  result in 100 per cent vesting, had not been inappropriately enhanced by the starting position of the performance period being lower as a consequence  of a fall in share price following the Samarco dam failure.

Pension contributions for Andrew Mackenzie in FY2020 (until the date he ceased as CEO and Executive Director) were also made in accordance\nwith the remuneration policy approved by shareholders in 2019 (ie. based on 25 per cent of base salary). Pension contributions for both were made into an international retirement plan.\n\n(3) FY2021 CDP award is provided one-third in cash and two-thirds in deferred equity (on the terms of the CDP) as shown in the table below. No discretion was applied to STIP awards when determining\nvesting of awards in FY2021 or FY2020.\n\n(4) Mike Henry's LTIP award value for FY2021 is based on the full award he received in 2016 when he was President Operations, Minerals Australia (prior to becoming, and with no proration applied for\ntime as, CEO and Executive Director). The value is based on 100 per cent of the award vesting, including a DEP amount of US$1.291 million paid in shares. The value delivered through share price\nappreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date as prescribed under UK requirements was US$3.800 million. Mike Henry’s LTIP award value for FY2020 is based on the full award he\nreceived in 2015 when he was President Coal (prior to becoming, and with no proration applied for time as, CEO and Executive Director).

There have been no changes to his base salary, benefit entitlements or\npension contributions since that date. For Andrew Mackenzie, the single total figure of remuneration is calculated on the basis of his period as CEO and Executive Director up until 31 December 2019.\nThere were no changes to his base salary, benefit entitlements or pension contributions prior to the date of his cessation as CEO and Executive Director.\n\nAconsequence of the transition to the revised remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs which took effect from 1 July 2019,\nis that the FY2021 single total figure of remuneration for Mike Henry requires disclosure of the full amount of the CDP award earned during FY2021\n(ie. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award are deferred and five-year deferred shares were not a feature of the former STIP) together\nwith the full amount of the pre-existing LTIP award vesting at the end of FY2021 which was granted in 2016 (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double\nthe current grant size).

No discretion was applied to STIP awards when determining  vesting of awards in FY2021 or FY2020.\n\n \n(4) \tMike Henry’s LTIP award value for FY2021 is based on the full award he received in 2016 when he was President Operations, Minerals Australia (prior to becoming, and with no proration applied for  time as, CEO and Executive Director). The value is based on 100 per cent of the award vesting, including a DEP amount of US\\$1.291 million paid in shares. The value delivered through share price  appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date as prescribed under UK requirements was US\\$3.800 million. Mike Henry’s LTIP award value for FY2020 is based on the full award he  received in 2015 when he was President Coal (prior to becoming, and with no proration applied for time as, CEO and Executive Director). The value is based on 48 per cent of the award vesting,  including a DEP amount of US\\$0.548 million paid in shares. The value delivered through share price appreciation between the date of grant and the vesting date was US\\$0.774 million.\n\n (5)\tFor Mike Henry, the single total figure of remuneration is calculated on the basis of his appointment on 1 January 2020. There have been no changes to his base salary, benefit entitlements or  pension contributions since that date. For Andrew Mackenzie, the single total figure of remuneration is calculated on the basis of his period as CEO and Executive Director up until 31 December 2019.  \nA consequence of the transition to the revised remuneration policy approved by shareholders at the 2019 AGMs which took effect from 1 July 2019,  is that the FY2021 single total figure of remuneration for Mike Henry requires disclosure of the full amount of the CDP award earned during FY2021  (i.e. irrespective that some elements of the CDP award are deferred and five-year deferred shares were not a feature of the former STIP) together  with the full amount of the pre-existing LTIP award vesting at the end of FY2021 which was granted in 2016 (i.e. when the LTIP award size was double  the current grant size). Had the current approved remuneration policy been in place when Mike’s 2016 LTIP grant was made, the reported LTIP value  for FY2021 would have been  $\\cup S\\Phi3.970$   million (instead of US\\$7.939 million in the table above) and the reported single total figure of remuneration  for FY2021 would have been US\\$10.552 million (instead of US\\$14.521 million in the table above).  \nThe table outlines information about compensation (CDP and LTIP) for two individuals, Mike Henry and Andrew Mackenzie, for the fiscal years 2020 and 2021.\n\n**Mike Henry:**\n\n- **FY2021 (CDP):** \n  - CDP was awarded based on performance for FY2021.\n  - One-third was provided in cash in September 2021.\n  - One-third is deferred in an equity award set to vest in FY2024.\n  - One-third is deferred in an equity award set to vest in FY2027.\n\n- **FY2021 (LTIP):**\n  - Based on performance over five years until June 2021.\n  - 100% of Mike's 192,360 awards from the 2016 LTIP vested.\n  - The awards were granted when he was President Operations, Minerals Australia.\n  - The value of the vested awards includes a DEP, paid in shares.\n\n- **FY2020 (CDP):**\n  - CDP was awarded based on performance for FY2020.\n  - One-third was provided in cash in September 2020.\n  - One-third is deferred in an equity award set to vest in FY2023.\n  - One-third is deferred in an equity award set to vest in FY2026.\n\n- **FY2020 (LTIP):**\n  - Based on performance over five years until June 2020.\n  - 48% of Mike's 192,360 awards from the 2015 LTIP vested, the rest lapsed.\n  - The awards were granted when he was President Coal.\n  - The value of the vested awards includes a DEP, paid in shares.\n\n**Andrew Mackenzie:**\n\n- **FY2020 (CDP):**\n  - Prorated CDP was awarded based on FY2020 performance.\n  - Two-thirds of the award was paid in cash in September 2020, covering cash and two-year deferred equity portion.\n  - Nothing will be or has been given for the five-year deferred equity portion.\n\n- **FY2020 (LTIP):**\n  - Details of Andrew’s vested 2015 LTIP award, which vested post-retirement from BHP, are in section 3.3.24 of the 2020 Annual Report.\nFY2021 CDP performance outcomes \nThe Board and Remuneration Committee assessed the CEO’s CDP outcome in light of the Group’s performance in FY2021, taking into account the  CEO’s performance against the KPIs in his CDP scorecard. Having recorded strong safety, operational and financial performance in FY2021 (after  fully eliminating the very positive impacts of commodity prices during the year, particularly for iron ore), when assessing performance against the  targets set at the commencement of the year the Board and Committee determined the CDP outcome for the CEO for FY2021 at 115 per cent against  the target of 100 per cent (which represents an outcome of 77 per cent against maximum). The Board and Committee believe this outcome is  appropriately aligned with the shareholder experience and the interests of the Group’s other stakeholders.  \nThe CEO’s CDP scorecard outcomes for FY2021 are summarised in the following tables, including a narrative description of each performance  measure and the CEO’s level of achievement, as determined by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board. The level of performance  for each measure is determined based on a range of threshold (the minimum necessary to qualify for any reward outcome), target (where the  performance requirements are met), and maximum (where the performance requirements are significantly exceeded).

While ROCE excludes exceptional items, the Remuneration Committee reviews each exceptional item\n\nto assess if it should be included in the result for the purposes of deriving the ROCE CDP outcome.\n\nWhen we are assessing management's performance, we make adjustments to the ROCE result to allow for changes in commodity prices, foreign\nexchange movements and other material items to ensure the assessment appropriately measures outcomes that are within the control and influence\nof the Group and its executives. Of these, changes in commodity prices have historically been the most material due to volatility in prices and the\nimpact on Group revenue and ROCE.\n\nFinancial measure\n\nScorecard targets\n\nPerformance against scorecard targets\n\nMeasure outcome\n\nROCE\n\nFor FY2021, the target for ROCE\nwas 13.5%, with a threshold of\n11.6% and a maximum of 15.0%.\n\nThe target ROCE is derived from\nthe Group's approved annual\nbudget. It is the Group's practice to\nbuild a material element of stretch\nperformance into the budget.\nAchievement of this stretching\nROCE target will result in a target\nCDP outcome. The threshold\n\nand maximum are a fair range of\nROCE outcomes that represent a\nlower limit of underperformance\nbelow which no CDP award\nshould be made, and an upper\nlimit of outperformance that\nwould represent the maximum\nCDP award.\n\nBecause a material element\n\nof stretch performance is built\ninto the budget (and hence the\nROCE target derived from the\nbudget), together with physical\nand regulatory asset constraints,\nthe performance range around\ntarget is subject to a greater\n\nlevel of downside risk than\n\nthere is upside opportunity.\nAccordingly, the range between\nthreshold and target is greater\nthan that between target and\nmaximum. For maximum, the\nCommittee takes care not to\ncreate leveraged incentives that\nencourage executives to push\nfor short-term performance that\ngoes beyond our risk appetite\nand current operational capacity.\nThe Committee retains, and has a\ntrack record of applying, downward\ndiscretion to ensure that the CDP\noutcome is appropriately aligned\nwith the overall performance of\nthe Group for the year, and is fair\nto management and shareholders.\n\nROCE of 32.5% was reported by BHP for FY2021. Adjusted for\n\nthe factors outlined below, ROCE is 14.3%, which is above target.\nThe following adjustments were made to ensure the outcomes\nappropriately reflect the performance of management for the year:\n\n- The full elimination of the impacts of very positive movements\nin commodities prices (particularly iron ore) and exchange rates\ndecreased ROCE by 17.4 percentage points.\n\n- Having reviewed the FY2021 exceptional items (as described in\nnote 3 ‘Exceptional items’ in section 3), the Committee determined\nthey should not be considered for the purposes of determining the\nFY2021 ROCE CDP outcome, with the exception of the exceptional\nitem in relation to the costs of the COVID-19 pandemic on BHP’s\nFY2021 results. The Committee concluded the above-budget\nportion of additional direct costs of COVID-19 should flow through to\nthe ROCE outcomes for CDP scorecard purposes. The Committee\nconsidered this was appropriate in light of the continuing global\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This adjustment reduced ROCE\nby 0.3 percentage points. Beyond this, the Committee concluded\nno further action was required in respect of exceptional items.\n\n- Adjustments for other material items ordinarily made to ensure the\noutcomes reflect the performance of management for the year\ndecreased ROCE by 0.5 percentage points. This was mainly due\nto the elimination of the positive effect on ROCE outcomes of the\nreduction in the closing balance sheet due to exceptional items.\n\nThe key drivers of the FY2021 ROCE outcome of 14.3% being above the\ntarget for FY2021 of 13.5% set at the commencement of the year were:\n\n- In Minerals Australia, operational performance was strong, with\nWestern Australia Iron Ore achieving record production, Olympic\nDam achieving its highest annual copper production level since\nour acquisition in 2005 on the back of improved smelter stability\nand strong underground mine performance, and Queensland Coal\nachieving record production at Goonyella. However, this was more\nthan offset by higher than budgeted depreciation across most\nassets and the inclusion of the above-budget portion of additional\ndirect costs of COVID-19, resulting in a slight overall below-target\nROCE outcome for Minerals Australia.\n\n- In Minerals Americas, driven mainly by Escondida maintaining\naverage concentrator throughput at record levels by managing\nCOVID-19 impacts and optimisation of materials fed to the\nconcentrators. This was partially offset by the slower than planned\nSpence Growth Option concentrator ramp-up due to tailings\nwork, permits and water availability, and the inclusion of the\nabove-budget portion of additional direct costs of COVID-19.\n\n- In Petroleum, driven mainly by higher than expected gas demand\nand improved performance in Australia, combined with lower\nmaintenance activity at Australian operations, partially offset by\nthe inclusion of the above-budget portion of additional direct\ncosts of COVID-19.\n\nBetween target\nand maximum.\n\nThe outcome against the ROCE KPI for FY2021 was 60 per cent out of the target of 50 per cent.\n\nnto | BHP | AnnualReport 2021\n", "vlm_text": "2.2   Remuneration Report  continued \nFinancial \nROCE is underlying profit after taxation (excluding after-taxation finance costs and exceptional items) divided by average capital employed.

Progressing to plan.\n   - **Measure Outcome**: Between target and maximum.\n\n2. **Social Value**:\n   - **Individual Measures**: Establishment of social value plans, reframing of social value narrative, leadership restructuring, and progress on claims.\n   - **Performance against Scorecard Targets**: All targets delivered, narrative reframing is underway, successful leadership restructure, and progress on compensation programs.\n   - **Measure Outcome**: Target.\n\n3. **People**:\n   - **Individual Measures**: Increase in female participation, increase in Operations Services employees, new Engagement and Perception Survey implementation, and development/succession plans for executive leadership.\n   - **Performance against Scorecard Targets**: Increase in gender diversity, OS employee numbers increased, successful EPS implementation, ELT transitions completed.\n   - **Measure Outcome**: Between threshold and target.\n\n4. **Portfolio**:\n   - **Individual Measures**: Portfolio strategy delivery, exploration and development performance, business development process improvement.\n   - **Performance against Scorecard Targets**: Strong progress on key strategies, refreshed exploration strategy, improved interactions between development and exploration teams.\n   - **Measure Outcome**: Target.\nLTIP performance outcomes \nLTIP vesting based on performance to June 2021 \nThe five-year performance period for the 2016 LTIP award ended on 30 June 2021. The CEO’s 2016 LTIP award comprised 192,360 awards (granted  as President Operations, Minerals Australia prior to his appointment as CEO). Vesting is subject to achievement of the relative TSR performance  conditions and any discretion applied by the Remuneration Committee (see ‘Overarching discretion and vesting underpin’ in this section 2.2.3). \nTesting the performance condition \nFor the award to vest in full, TSR must exceed the Peer Group TSR (for 67 per cent of the award) and the Index TSR (for 33 per cent of the award) by an  average of 5.5 per cent per year for five years, being 30.7 per cent in total compounded over the performance period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021.  TSR includes returns to BHP shareholders in the form of share price movements along with dividends paid and reinvested in BHP (including cash and   in-specie dividends). \nBHP’s TSR performance was positive 266.5 per cent over the five-year period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2021. This is above the weighted median Peer Group  TSR of positive 213.9 per cent and above the Index TSR of positive 99.8 per cent over the same period. This level of performance results in 100 per cent  vesting for the 2016 LTIP award. The value of the CEO’s vested 2016 LTIP award has been reported in ‘Single total figure of remuneration’ in this section 2.2.3. "}

FY2019 STIP  deferred share awards vested in August 2021 and FY2020 CDP two-year deferred share awards will not vest until August 2022. Peter’s and Daniel’s unvested  LTIP awards and CDP five-year deferred shares were prorated to reflect the percentage of the performance period to 28 February 2021 for Peter and  31 December 2020 for Daniel. The vesting of the retained prorated LTIP awards will be determined by the Committee at the relevant time in future years  and will only vest to the extent the performance conditions are met at the end of each five-year performance period. The vesting of LTIP awards and  CDP five-year deferred share awards are subject to the Committee’s ability to reduce vesting through its discretion under the plan rules.  "}

Feedback from shareholders is used by the Remuneration Committee\nin its decision-making in respect of the remuneration policy and its application. The Group also conducts regular employee engagement\nsurveys which give employees an opportunity to provide feedback on a wide range of employee matters. Many employees are also ordinary\nshareholders through Shareplus and therefore have the opportunity to share their views as shareholders.\n\nSimplicity The purpose, structure and strategic alignment of each element of remuneration is clearly set out in section 2.2.2.\n\nRisk Asignificant portion of variable remuneration is at-risk in order to provide strong alignment between remuneration outcomes and the\ninterests of BHP shareholders. The delivery of two-thirds of CDP awards in deferred shares and the LTIP five-year performance period help\nto align the long-term interests of the CEO and shareholders.\n\nPredictability The remuneration opportunities under different performance scenarios (minimum, target and maximum) are set out in section 2.2.2.\n\nProportionality The CEO is incentivised to achieve stretching performance through the targets set under the CDP and LTIP. In addition, the Remuneration\nCommittee has discretion to adjust formulaic outcomes downwards to ensure that poor performance is not rewarded.\n\nAlignment The FY2021 CDP performance measures for the CEO include a number of measures linked to culture including the delivery of social value\n\nwith culture plans for assets, improving gender diversity and embedding a new Engagement and Perception Survey system. We continue to focus on\n\nfostering a culture of respect and ensuring the workplace is safe at all times.\n\nEngagement of independent remuneration advisers\n\nThe Committee seeks and considers advice from independent remuneration advisers where appropriate. Remuneration consultants are engaged by\nand report directly to the Committee. Potential conflicts of interest are taken into account when remuneration consultants are selected and their terms\nof engagement regulate their level of access to, and require their independence from BHP’s management.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed by the Committee in March 2016 to act as an independent remuneration adviser.

The second column is titled \"Section in this Annual Report\" and indicates where the information can be found: \"Section 3, note 22 ‘Net finance costs’\".\nParagraphs (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13) and (14) of Listing Rule 9.8.4 R are not applicable.  \nThe Directors confirm, on the advice of the Risk and Audit Committee (RAC), that they consider the Annual Report (including the Financial Statements),  taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess BHP’s position, performance,  business model and strategy. \n2.3.1   Review of operations, principal activities and state of affairs \nA review of the operations of BHP during FY2021, the results of those operations during FY2021 and the expected results of those operations in future  financial years are set out in section 1, in particular in 1.2 to 1.15, 1.17 and 1.18 and in other material in this Annual Report. Information on the development  of BHP and likely developments in future years also appears in those sections. We have excluded certain information from the Strategic Report in  section 1 (which forms part of this Directors’ Report), to the extent permitted by UK and Australian law, on the basis that such information relates to  impending developments or matters in the course of negotiation and disclosure would be seriously prejudicial to the interests of BHP. This is because  such disclosure could be misleading due to the fact it is premature or preliminary in nature, relates to commercially sensitive contracts, would  undermine confidentiality between BHP and our suppliers and clients, or would otherwise unreasonably damage BHP. The categories of information  omitted include forward looking estimates and projections prepared for internal management purposes, information regarding BHP’s assets and  projects, which is developing and susceptible to change, and information relating to commercial contracts and pricing modules. \nOur principal activities during FY2021 are disclosed in section 1. We are among the world’s top producers of major commodities, including iron ore,  metallurgical coal and copper. We also have substantial interests in oil, gas and energy coal. No significant changes in the nature of BHP’s principal  activities occurred during FY2021 other than as disclosed in section 1. There were no significant changes in BHP’s state of affairs that occurred during  FY2021 and no significant post balance date events other than as disclosed in section 1 and note 35 ‘Subsequent events’ in section 3. No other matter  or circumstance has arisen since the end of FY2021 that has significantly affected or is expected to significantly affect the operations, the results of  operations or state of affairs of BHP in future years. \n2.3.2   Share capital and buy-back programs \nAt the Annual General Meetings held in 2019 and 2020, shareholders authorised BHP Group Plc to make on-market purchases of up to 211,207,180 of  its ordinary shares, representing 10 per cent of BHP Group Plc’s issued share capital at that time. During FY2021, we did not make any on-market or off- market purchases of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc shares under any share buy-back program. As at the date of this Directors’ Report, there were  no current on-market buy-backs. Shareholders will be asked at the 2021 Annual General Meetings to renew this authority. As at the date of this Directors’  Report, there is no intention to exercise this authority.  \nSome of our executives receive rights over BHP shares as part of their remuneration arrangements. Entitlements may be satisfied by the transfer of existing  shares, which are acquired on-market by the Employee Share Ownership Plan (ESOP) Trusts or, in respect of some entitlements, by the issue of shares.  The number of shares referred to in column A below were purchased to satisfy awards made under the various BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc  employee share schemes during FY2021. \nThe table provides information about the shares purchased and transferred to employees as part of employee awards from July 2020 to June 2021. It details the number of shares bought each month and the average price paid per share. The table also notes the maximum number of shares that may still be purchased under specific plans or programs by the BHP Group.\n\nHere's what each column represents:\n\n- **Period**: The timeframe for the data is from July 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021, broken down monthly.\n  \n- **Column A**: \"Total number of shares purchased and transferred to employees to satisfy employee awards\" shows how many shares were bought each month to provide employee awards. Notably, shares were purchased in August 2020, January 2021, and April 2021, with respective totals of 6,158,718, 882,454, and 731,235 shares, culminating in a total of 7,772,407 shares over the provided period.\n\n- **Column B**: \"Average price paid per share (US$)\" indicates the average cost per share in U.S. dollars for each of the periods when shares were purchased. The prices were $28.32 in August 2020, $36.57 in January 2021, and $38.00 in April 2021, averaging to $30.16 for all transactions combined.\n\n- **Column C**: \"Total number of shares purchased as part of publicly announced plans or programs\" doesn't report any specific numbers throughout the period observed, implying no shares were bought under these specific conditions.\n\n- **Column D**: The \"Maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the plans or programs\" shows that 211,207,180 shares are authorized for purchase through BHP Group Plc, while there are no figures provided for BHP Group Limited, suggesting no limit was set or documented for the latter during this particular time frame."}

Lindsay Maxsted\nretired as a Non-executive Director of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc on 4 September 2020\n\nEach person who held the office of Director at the date the Board approved this Directors’ Report made the following statements:\n\n- so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which BHP’s External Auditor is unaware\n- the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken as a Director to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information\nand to establish that BHP’s External Auditor is aware of that information\n\nThis confirmation is given pursuant to section 418 of the UK Companies Act 2006 and should be interpreted in accordance with, and subject to,\nthose provisions.\n\nConsistent with the then applicable UK and EU requirements in regard to audit firm tender and rotation, BHP conducted an audit tender during FY2017.\n\nAfter a comprehensive tender process, at a meeting held on 16 August 2017, the Board selected EY as its independent registered public accounting\nfirm from the financial year beginning 1 July 2019, and our shareholders approved EY’s appointment at the Annual General Meetings in 2019.\n\n2.3.12 Non-audit services\n\nInformation on the non-audit services undertaken by BHP’s External Auditor, including the amounts paid for non-audit services, refer to note 36\n‘Auditor's remuneration’ in section 3. All non-audit services were approved in accordance with the process set out in the Policy on Provision of\nAudit and Other Services by the External Auditor. No non-audit services were carried out that were specifically excluded by the Policy on Provision\nof Audit and Other Services by the External Auditor. Based on advice provided by the RAC, the Directors have formed the view that the provision\nof non-audit services is compatible with the general standard of independence for auditors, and that the nature of non-audit services means that\nauditor independence was not compromised. For a statement of the reasons for this view and for more information about our policy in relation\n\nto the provision of non-audit services by the auditor, refer to section 2.1.10.\n\n2.3.13 Political donations\n\nWe maintain a position of impartiality with respect to party politics and do not make political contributions or expenditure/donations for political\npurposes to any political party, politician, elected official or candidate for public office.

All such amounts are measured\nin accordance with the terms of the arrangement, which is usually in\nproportion to the Group's interest in the joint operation.\n\n= Joint ventures: A joint venture is a joint arrangement in which the parties\nthat share joint control have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.\nAseparate vehicle, not the parties, will have the rights to the assets and\nobligations for the liabilities relating to the arrangement. More than an\ninsignificant share of output from a joint venture is sold to third parties,\nwhich indicates the joint venture is not dependent on the parties to the\narrangement for funding, nor do the parties have an obligation for the\nliabilities of the arrangement. Joint ventures are accounted for using\nthe equity accounting method.\n\nAssociates: The Group accounts for investments in associates using the\nequity accounting method. An entity is considered an associate where\nthe Group is deemed to have significant influence but not control or joint\ncontrol. Significant influence is presumed to exist where the Group:\n\n- has over 20 per cent but less than 50 per cent of the voting rights of an\nentity, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that this is not the case or\n\n- holds less than 20 per cent of the voting rights of an entity; however,\nhas the power to participate in the financial and operating policy\ndecisions affecting the entity\n\nThe Group uses the term ‘equity accounted investments’ to refer to joint\nventures and associates collectively.\n\nForeign currencies\n\nTransactions related to the Group’s worldwide operations are conducted\nin a number of foreign currencies.

As the Group\nprogresses its adaptation strategy, the identification of additional risks or\nthe detailed development of the Group’s response may result in material\nchanges to financial results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities\nin future reporting periods.\n\n", "vlm_text": "The Group’s offset strategy is currently being managed at a  consolidated Group level and therefore is not currently incorporated  into the forecast cash flows of individual assets. Any change to the  Group’s climate change strategy could impact these forecasts and  the Group’s significant judgements and key estimates.  \nThe Group continues to invest, including in partnership with others,  in emissions reduction projects and technology innovation and  development in its value chain to support reductions to its total  reported Scope 3 GHG emissions inventory. However, while we seek  to influence, Scope 3 emissions occur outside of our direct control.  Reduction pathways are dependent on the development and upstream  or downstream deployment of solutions and/or supportive policy.  It is therefore currently not possible to reliably estimate or measure  the full potential financial statement impacts of the Group’s pursuit  of its Scope 3 goals and targets.  \nExpenditure under the Climate Investment Program (CIP) which, as  announced by the Group in July 2019, aims to invest at least US\\$400 million  over the CIP’s five-year life in emissions reduction projects across the  Group’s operated assets and value chain, is recognised in the relevant  year of expenditure. \nGlobal transition signposts and commodity impacts \nIn addition to the Group’s targets and goals, significant judgements and  key estimates are also impacted by the Group’s current assessment of  the range of economic and climate related conditions that could exist in  transitioning to a low carbon economy, considering the current trajectory  of society and the global economy as a whole. Despite recent progress,  all  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   pathways to 2050 represent a major departure from today’s  global trajectory and the Group does not believe the technological,  regulatory, or economic foundations for a rapid transition to net zero  emissions are currently in place. Acknowledging these signposts, the  Group’s current best estimate of the potential impacts of climate change  and the transition to a low carbon economy are reflected in the following  two scenarios, which consider existing policies, trends and commitments  and the Group’s view of the most likely range of futures for the global  economy and associated sub-systems:\n\n \n–\t  Central Energy View:  reflects, and is periodically updated to respond  to, existing policy trends and commitments and currently tracks to  approximately  $3^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   temperature increase above pre-industrial levels  by 2100\n\n \n–\t  Lower Carbon View:  currently tracks to approximately  $2.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$    temperature increase by 2100, and accelerates decarbonisation  trends and policies, particularly in easier-to-abate sectors such  as power generation and light duty vehicles \nThese two scenarios are reviewed periodically to reflect new information.  \nThese scenarios are currently being used as inputs to the Group’s  planning cases, informing updates to the Group’s supply, demand and  price forecasts, capital allocation and portfolio decisions. As such, these  scenarios impact certain significant judgements and key estimates,  including the determination of the valuation of assets and potential  impairment charges (notes 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and 13  ‘Impairment of non-current assets’), the estimation of the remaining  useful economic life of assets for depreciation purposes (note 11 ‘Property,  plant and equipment’), the timing of closure and rehabilitation activities  (note 15 ‘Closure and rehabilitation provisions’) and the recoverability  of certain deferred tax assets (note 14 ‘Deferred tax balances’). \nThe Group continues to monitor global decarbonisation signposts and  update its planning cases accordingly. Where such signposts indicate  the appropriate measures are in place for achievement of a  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   Paris- aligned scenario, this will be reflected in the Group’s planning cases. \nAlthough all potential financial reporting consequences under the Group’s   $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   Paris-aligned scenario are currently impracticable to fully assess, the  long-term commodity price outlooks under this scenario are either largely  consistent with or favourable to the price outlooks in the Group’s current  planning cases, with the exception of energy coal, oil and natural gas.  \nThere are inherent limitations with scenario analysis and it is difficult to  predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate and none of the  scenarios considered constitutes a definitive outcome for the Group.  \nThe long-term commodity price outlooks under the Group’s  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   Paris- aligned scenario, excluding energy coal, oil and natural gas, reflect: \n\n \n–\t Copper and nickel benefiting from the dramatic pace of electrification  over and above the Group’s current planning cases\n\n –\t Iron ore growth underpinned by the benefit to steel demand from  the construction of renewables, particularly wind power\n\n –\t Potash growth reflecting the potential for greater penetration  of biofuels \n\n –\t Metallurgical coal supported by the limited alternatives in steelmaking  over the scenario timeframe  \nGiven the positive long-term price outlooks for these commodities, the  Group currently considers that a material adverse change is not expected  to the valuation, and remaining useful life, of assets and discounting  of closure and rehabilitation provisions for assets relating to these  commodities under its  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$   Paris-aligned scenario.  \nFor energy coal, oil and natural gas, long-term commodity price outlooks  under the Group’s  $1.5^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$  Paris-aligned scenario are unfavourable to the  price outlooks in the Group’s current planning cases.

(Samarco) iron ore operation in Minas Gerais, Brazil, experienced a tailings dam failure that resulted  in a release of mine tailings, flooding the communities of Bento Rodrigues, Gesteira and Paracatu and impacting other communities downstream  (the Samarco dam failure). Refer to section 1.15 ‘Samarco’. \nSamarco is jointly owned by BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda (BHP Brasil) and Vale S.A. (Vale). BHP Brasil’s 50 per cent interest is accounted for as an equity  accounted joint venture investment. BHP Brasil does not separately recognise its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of Samarco, but instead  records the investment as one line on the balance sheet. Each period, BHP Brasil recognises its 50 per cent share of Samarco’s profit or loss and adjusts  the carrying value of the investment in Samarco accordingly. Such adjustment continues until the investment carrying value is reduced to   $\\cup S\\Phi$  nil,  with any additional share of Samarco losses only recognised to the extent that BHP Brasil has an obligation to fund the losses. After applying equity  accounting, any remaining carrying value of the investment is tested for impairment.  \nAny charges relating to the Samarco dam failure incurred directly by BHP Brasil or other BHP entities are recognised 100 per cent in the Group’s results.

Key Programs include\nthose for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including fisherfolk impacted by the dam failure, and those for remediation of\nimpacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian\nFederal and State Governments, local municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence Office oversees the activities\nof the Fundagdo Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of actions agreed in the Framework Agreement. In addition, the 12th Federal\nCourt is supervising the work of the Fundagao Renova and the Court's decisions have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision change in\nestimate. Any future decisions will be analysed for impacts on the provision at the time of any decision.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of one year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement\nhave been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco has primary responsibility for funding Fundagao Renova’s annual calendar year\nbudget for the duration of the Framework Agreement. The funding amounts for each calendar year will be dependent on the remediation and\ncompensation projects to be undertaken in a particular year. Annual contributions may be reviewed under the Framework Agreement. To the extent\nthat Samarco does not meet its funding obligations, each of BHP Brasil and Vale have secondary funding obligations under the Framework Agreement\nin proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nSamarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains significant uncertainty regarding Samarco’s long-\nterm cash flow generation. In light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil's provision for its obligations under\nthe Framework Agreement Programs is US$2.6 billion before tax and after discounting at 30 June 2021 (30 June 2020: US$1.8 billion).\n\nUnder a Governance Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process to renegotiate the Programs\n\nover two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim (described below).\nPre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement, for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement were not implemented during the two year\nperiod and on 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the\nR$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which has been suspended from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. The claim\nremains suspended after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19 March 2021. BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State\nprosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement\nand the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. It is not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable\nestimate of potential settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently reflected\n\nin the Samarco dam failure provision. Until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundagao Renova will continue to implement the Programs in\naccordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nBHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale are required to maintain security of an amount equal to the Fundagdo Renova’s annual budget up to a limit of R$2.2 billion\n(approximately US$440 million). The security currently comprises R$1.3 billion (approximately US$260 million) in insurance bonds and a charge of\nR$800 million (approximately US$160 million) over Samarco’s assets. A further R$100 million (approximately US$20 million) in liquid assets previously\nmaintained as security was released for COVID-19 related response efforts in Brazil.\n\nSamarco Germano dam decommissioning\n\nSamarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano dam complex). Given the\nsignificant uncertainties surrounding Samarco’s long-term cash flow generation, BHP Brasil’s provision for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano\ndecommissioning costs is US$232 million (80 June 2020: US$227 million).

The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly  evaluated in determining whether a provision for any specific claim  is required.  \nManagement has determined that a provision can only be recognised  for obligations under the Framework Agreement and Samarco  Germano dam decommissioning as at 30 June 2021. It is not yet  possible to provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate  of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent  liabilities noted below, given their status. \nEstimates:  The provisions for Samarco dam failure and Samarco  Germano dam decommissioning currently reflect the estimated  remaining costs to complete Programs under the Framework  Agreement and estimated costs to complete the Germano dam  decommissioning and require the use of significant judgements,  estimates and assumptions.

Cost is the fair value of  consideration given to acquire the asset at the time of its acquisition or  construction and includes the direct costs of bringing the asset to the  location and the condition necessary for operation and the estimated  future costs of closure and rehabilitation of the facility.  \nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated  depreciation and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement  of lease liabilities. Refer to note 21 ‘Leases’ for details.  \nExploration and evaluation \nExploration costs are incurred to discover mineral and petroleum  resources. Evaluation costs are incurred to assess the technical feasibility  and commercial viability of resources found. \nExploration and evaluation expenditure is charged to the income  statement as incurred, except in the following circumstances in which  case the expenditure may be capitalised: \nIn respect of minerals activities:\n\n \n–\t the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest  that was previously acquired as an asset acquisition or in a business  combination and measured at fair value on acquisition or\n\n –\t the existence of a commercially viable mineral deposit has  been established \nIn respect of petroleum activities:\n\n \n–\t the exploration and evaluation activity is within an area of interest for  which it is expected that the expenditure will be recouped by future  exploitation or sale or\n\n –\t exploration and evaluation activity has not reached a stage that  permits a reasonable assessment of the existence of commercially  recoverable reserves \nA regular review of each area of interest is undertaken to determine the  appropriateness of continuing to carry forward costs in relation to that  area. Capitalised costs are only carried forward to the extent that they  are expected to be recovered through the successful exploitation of the  area of interest or alternatively by its sale. To the extent that capitalised  expenditure is no longer expected to be recovered, it is charged to the  income statement. \nKey judgements and estimates \nJudgements:  Exploration and evaluation expenditure results in  certain items of expenditure being capitalised for an area of interest  where a judgement is made that it is likely to be recoverable by  future exploitation or sale, or where the activities are judged not to  have reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment of the  existence of reserves.  \nEstimates:  Management makes certain estimates and assumptions  as to future events and circumstances, in particular when making  quantitative assessment of whether an economically viable extraction  operation can be established. These estimates and assumptions  may change as new information becomes available. If, after having  capitalised the expenditure under the policy, new information  suggests that recovery of the expenditure is unlikely, the relevant  capitalised amount is charged to the income statement. \nThe Group may use funds sourced from external parties to finance the  acquisition and development of assets and operations. Finance costs  are expensed as incurred, except where they relate to the financing  of construction or development of qualifying assets. Borrowing costs  directly attributable to acquiring or constructing a qualifying asset are  capitalised during the development phase. Development expenditure  is net of proceeds from the saleable material extracted during the  development phase. On completion of development, all assets  included in assets under construction are reclassified as either plant  and equipment or other mineral assets and depreciation commences.  \nKey judgements and estimates \nJudgements:  Development activities commence after  project sanctioning by the appropriate level of management.  Judgement is applied by management in determining when a project  is economically viable.  \nEstimates:  In determining whether a project is economically viable,  management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions  as to future events and circumstances, including reserve estimates,  existence of an accessible market and forecast prices and cash flows.  Estimates and assumptions may change as new information becomes  available. If, after having commenced the development activity,  new information suggests that a development asset is impaired,  the appropriate amount is charged to the income statement. \nOther mineral assets \nOther mineral assets comprise: \n–\t capitalised exploration, evaluation and development expenditure  for assets in production\n\n –\t mineral rights and petroleum interests acquired\n\n –\t capitalised development and production stripping costs \nOverburden removal costs \nThe process of removing overburden and other waste materials to access  mineral deposits is referred to as stripping. Stripping is necessary to  obtain access to mineral deposits and occurs throughout the life of an  open-pit mine.

Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post-\ntax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset's carrying value. FVLCD may also take into\nconsideration other market-based indicators of fair value.\n\nValue in use\n\nVIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and\nits eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and cannot take into account future\ndevelopment.

The valuation applied a post-tax real discount rate of 6.5 per cent. The post-\nimpairment carrying value of NSWEC’s property, plant and equipment is not material, therefore any\n\nchanges to key estimates will not give rise to a further material impairment.\n\nThe valuation for Potash is most sensitive to changes in the long-term potash price outlook and the risking\napplied to the future development phases of the potash resource.

Cash flows are discounted using an appropriate post- tax market discount rate to arrive at a net present value of the asset, which is compared against the asset’s carrying value. FVLCD may also take into  consideration other market-based indicators of fair value. \nValue in use  \nVIU is determined as the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continued use of the asset in its present form and  its eventual disposal or closure. VIU is determined by applying assumptions specific to the Group’s continued use and cannot take into account future  development. These assumptions are different to those used in calculating FVLCD and consequently the VIU calculation is likely to give a different result  (usually lower) to a FVLCD calculation. \nImpairment of non-current assets (excluding goodwill) \nThe Group recognised the following impairments to non-current assets during the year: \nThe table provides a detailed analysis of impairment assessments for three different assets or cash-generating units (CGUs)—NSWEC, Cerrejón, and Potash—as of 30 June 2021. It covers the following aspects for each CGU:\n\n1. **What has been recognised?**\n   - **NSWEC:** Identified a negative recoverable amount of US$300 million, resulting in an impairment of US$1,057 million for FY2021.\n   - **Cerrejón:** Recoverable amount of US$284 million determined from sale proceeds, leading to a US$466 million impairment for FY2021.\n   - **Potash:** Recoverable amount determined to be US$3.3 billion, leading to an impairment charge of US$1.3 billion against property, plant, and equipment.\n\n2. **What were the drivers of impairment?**\n   - **NSWEC:** Influenced by the divestment process, market conditions for Australian thermal coal, the strong Australian dollar, and modifications to the mine plan.\n   - **Cerrejón:** The announcement of a Sale and Purchase Agreement to divest interests, involving Glencore.\n   - **Potash:** Recent market perspectives and expected valuations from future market participants were factors.\n\n3. **How were the valuations calculated?**\n   - **NSWEC:** Valuation utilizes Value In Use (VIU) by applying discounted cash flow (DCF) techniques.\n   - **Cerrejón:** The valuation uses Fair Value Less Costs of Disposal (FVLCD) based on expected sale proceeds.\n   - **Potash:** Employs FVLCD methodology with DCF techniques for valuation.\n\n4. **What were the significant assumptions and estimates used in the valuations?**\n   - **NSWEC:** Sensitive to energy coal prices, production volumes, and a post-tax real discount rate of 6.5%. Future impairments expected to be nominal.\n   - **Cerrejón:** No specific assumptions stated.\n   - **Potash:** Influenced by long-term potash price outlook and development phases with a post-tax real discount rate of 6.5%. Management foresees little risk of further material impairment the following year.\n\nKey judgments and estimates applied in valuations, particularly focusing on the methodology (DCF techniques), are referenced as being explained more thoroughly beyond this table."}

The Group performed an impairment test of the Olympic\nDam CGU, including goodwill, as at 31 December 2020 and an impairment charge was not required. A goodwill\nimpairment test was not required at 30 June 2021 as there were no indicators of impairment.\n\nHow did the goodwill arise?\n\nGoodwill arose on the acquisition of WMC Resources Ltd in June 2005.\n\nSegment Olympic Dam is part of the Copper reportable segment.\nHow were the valuations FVLCD methodology using DCF techniques has been applied in determining the recoverable amount of Olympic\ncalculated?\n\nDam. The calculation is based primarily on Level 3 inputs as defined in note 23 ‘Financial risk management’.\n\nSignificant assumptions\nand sensitivities\n\nThe current valuation of Olympic Dam exceeds its carrying amount by approximately US$1.8 billion and is most\nsensitive to changes in copper and gold commodity prices, production volumes, operating costs and discount\nrates. The valuation applied a post-tax real discount rate of 6 per cent.\n\nManagement consider that there are no reasonably possible changes in copper and gold price forecasts,\noperating cost estimates or the discount rate that would, in isolation, result in the estimated recoverable amount\nbeing equal to the carrying amount.\n\nA production volume decrease of 4.8 per cent across all commodities (copper, gold, silver and uranium) would,\nin isolation, result in the estimated recoverable amount being equal to the carrying amount. Typically, changes\nin any one of the aforementioned assumptions (including operating performance) would be accompanied by\na cchange in another assumption which may have an offsetting impact. Action is usually taken to respond to\nadverse changes in assumptions to mitigate the impact of any such change.\n\nKey judgements and estimates that have been applied in the FVLCD valuation are disclosed further below.\n\nOther goodwill\n\nGoodwill held by other CGUs is US$187 million (2020: US$187 million). This represents less than one per cent of net assets at 30 June 2021 (2020: less\nthan one per cent).

Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate\nimplicit in the lease, where this is readily determinable. Where the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted\nat the Group's incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect factors specific to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location\n\nof the lease.\n\nIn addition to containing a lease, the Group's contractual arrangements may include non-lease components.

The lease contracts contain a wide range of different terms and conditions including extension and termination options and variable lease payments. \nThe Group’s lease obligations are included in the Group’s Interest bearing liabilities and, with the exception of vessel lease contracts that are priced  with reference to a freight index, form part of the Group’s net debt.  \nThe table presents lease liability data for the years 2021 and 2020, expressed in millions of US dollars.

Refer to note 11 ‘Property, plant and equipment’. \nThe table presents financial data related to lease expenses and payments for the years 2021 and 2020, divided into sections for the income statement and cash flow statement.\n\n**Income Statement:**\n1. **Depreciation of right-of-use assets**\n   - 2021: $781 million\n   - 2020: $656 million\n   - Included within: Profit from operations\n\n2. **Short-term, low-value, and variable lease costs**\n   - 2021: $895 million\n   - 2020: $675 million\n   - Included within: Profit from operations\n\n3. **Interest on lease liabilities**\n   - 2021: $109 million\n   - 2020: $90 million\n   - Included within: Financial expenses\n\n**Cash Flow Statement:**\n1. **Principal lease payments**\n   - 2021: $770 million\n   - 2020: $671 million\n   - Included within: Cash flows from financing activities\n\n2. **Lease interest payments**\n   - 2021: $109 million\n   - 2020: $90 million\n   - Included within: Cash flows from operating activities\n(1)\t Relates to US\\$546 million of variable lease costs (2020: US\\$438 million), US\\$316 million of short-term lease costs (2020: US\\$211 million) and   $\\cup S\\Phi33$   million of low-value lease  costs (2020: US\\$26 million). Variable lease costs include contracts for hire of mining service equipment, drill rigs and transportation services. These contracts contain variable  lease payments based on usage and asset performance. \nRecognition and measurement \nAll leases with the exception of short-term (under 12 months) and low-value leases are recognised on the balance sheet, as a right-of-use asset  and a corresponding interest bearing liability. Lease liabilities are initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments from the lease  commencement date and are subsequently adjusted to reflect the interest on lease liabilities, lease payments and any remeasurements due to, for  example, lease modifications or a change to future lease payments linked to an index or rate. Lease payments are discounted using the interest rate  implicit in the lease, where this is readily determinable. Where the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the interest payments are discounted  at the Group’s incremental borrowing rate, adjusted to reflect factors specific to the lease, including where relevant the currency, tenor and location  of the lease.  \nIn addition to containing a lease, the Group’s contractual arrangements may include non-lease components. For example, certain mining services  arrangements involve the provision of additional services, including maintenance, drilling activities and the supply of personnel. The Group has  elected to separate these non-lease components from the lease components in measuring lease liabilities. "}

Provisional pricing mechanisms within these sales and purchases arrangements have the character of a commodity derivative. Trade receivables\nor payables under these contracts are carried at fair value through profit and loss using a method categorised as Level 2 based on forecast selling prices\nin the quotation period. The Group's exposure at 30 June 2021 to the impact of movements in commodity prices upon provisionally invoiced sales and\npurchases volumes was predominately around copper.\n\nThe Group had 254 thousand tonnes of copper exposure as at 30 June 2021 (2020: 301 thousand tonnes) that was provisionally priced. The final price\nof these sales and purchases volumes will be determined during the first half of FY2022.

The documentation also\ndemonstrates that the hedge is expected to be effective.\n\nThe Group applies the following types of hedge accounting to its derivatives hedging the interest rate and currency risks in its notes and debentures:\n\n- Fair value hedges - the fair value gain or loss on interest rate and cross currency swaps relating to interest rate risk, together with the change in the\nfair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk are recognised immediately in the income statement. If the hedge no\nlonger meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the fair value adjustment on the note or debenture is amortised to the income statement over the\nperiod to maturity using a recalculated effective interest rate.\n\n- Cash flow hedges - changes in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swaps which hedge foreign currency cash flows on the notes and\ndebentures are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the cash flow hedging reserve. To the extent a hedge\nis ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any\ncumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged\nitern’s maturity.\n\nWhen hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures. However, certain components of the fair value of derivatives\n\nare not permitted under IFRS 9 to be included in the hedge accounting above. Certain costs of hedging are permitted to be recognised in other\ncomprehensive income. Any change in the fair value of a derivative that does not qualify for hedge accounting, or is ineffective in hedging the\ndesignated risk due to contractual differences between the hedged item and hedging instrument, is recognised immediately in the income statement.\n\nThe table below shows the carrying amounts of the Group's notes and debentures by currency and the derivatives which hedge them:\n\n- The carrying amount of the notes and debentures includes foreign exchange remeasurement to period-end rates and fair value adjustments when\nincluded in a fair value hedge.\n\n- The breakdown of the hedging derivatives includes remeasurement of foreign currency notional values at period-end rates, fair value movements\ndue to interest rate risk, foreign currency cash flows designated into cash flow hedges, costs of hedging recognised in other comprehensive income,\nineffectiveness recognised in the income statement and accruals or prepayments.\n\n- The hedged value of notes and debentures includes their carrying amounts adjusted for the offsetting derivative fair value movements due to\nforeign currency and interest rate risk remeasurement.\n——— SS SSS SS SS\n\nFair value of derivatives\n\nCarrying Foreign Recognised Recognised\n\namount of exchange incash flow incostof Recognised in Hedged value\n\n2021 notes and notional at Interest hedging hedging the income Accrued of notes and\nUS$M debentures spot rates rate risk reserve reserve statement” cash flows Total debentures”\nA B c D E F G BtoG A+B+C\n\nUsD 6,270 = (318) = = 1 7 (230) 5,952\nGBP 3,387 435 (644) (81) 25 (34) 53 (146) 3,278\nEUR 4,486 73 (418) (33) 27 7 49 (295) 4141\nCAD 626 142 (21) (28) 25 (2) (2) 14 747\nTotal 14,769 650 (1,301) (142) 77 (18) 177 (657) 14,18\n\nFair value of derivatives\n\nCarrying Foreign Recognised Recognised\n\namount of exchange in cash flow incostof Recognised in Hedged value\n\n2020 notes and notional at Interest hedging hedging the income Accrued of notes and\nUS$M debentures spot rates rate risk reserve reserve statement” cash flows Total debentures”\nA B Cc D E F G BtoG A+B+C\n\nUSD 9,926 - (742) - - 29 74 (639) 9184\nGBP 3,245 764 (730) (16) 13 (18) 47 60 3,279\nEUR 7,294 500 (576) (55) 21 65 32 (13) 7.218\nCAD 580 199 (32) - (2) (4) (2) 159 747\nTotal 21,045 1,463 (2,080) (71) 32 72 151 (433) 20,428\n\n(1) Predominantly related to ineffectiveness.\n(2) Includes US$3,018 million (2020: US$3,019 million) of fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate that is not in a hedging relationship.\n\nThe weighted average interest rate payable is USD LIBOR + 2.18 per cent (2020: USD LIBOR + 2.95 per cent).

It is anticipated that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate\n(SOFR) benchmark rate will be widely adopted by market participants and effectively replace US LIBOR in new contracts during FY2022. However, a\nnumber of US LIBOR settings, including 3-month US LIBOR, will continue to be published until 30 June 2023. Accordingly, absent of any agreement with\ncounterparties to transition to an alternative risk-free rate before this date, the Group’s existing interest rate swaps with maturity dates beyond 30 June\n2023 will only transition to ARR once US LIBOR publication ceases.

To the extent a hedge  is ineffective, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.  \nWhen a hedging instrument expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is amortised to the income statement over the period to the hedged  item’s maturity. \nWhen hedged, the Group hedges the full notional value of notes or debentures.

The funding of the schemes\ncomplies with local regulations. The assets of the schemes are generally held separately from those of the Group and are administered by trustees\n\nor management boards.\nee]\n\nSchemes/Obligations Description\nDefined contribution For defined contribution schemes or schemes operated on an industry-wide basis where it is not possible to identify assets\npension schemes attributable to the participation by the Group's employees, the pension charge is calculated on the basis of contributions\n\nand multi-employer payable. The Group contributed US$334 million during the financial year (2020: US$260 million; 2019: US$274 million) to defined\n\npension schemes\ncontribution plans and multi-employer defined contribution plans. These contributions are expensed as incurred.\n\nDefined benefit For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing pensions is charged to the income statement so as to recognise\n\npension schemes current and past service costs, net interest cost on the net defined benefit obligations/plan assets and the effect of any\ncurtailments or settlements. Remeasurement gains and losses are recognised directly in equity. An asset or liability is consequently\nrecognised in the balance sheet based on the present value of defined benefit obligations less the fair value of plan assets, except\nthat any such asset cannot exceed the present value of expected refunds from and reductions in future contributions to the plan.\nDefined benefit obligations are estimated by discounting expected future payments using market yields at the reporting date on\nhigh-quality corporate bonds in countries that have developed corporate bond markets. However, where developed corporate\nbond markets do not exist, the discount rates are selected by reference to national government bonds. In both instances, the\nbonds are selected with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash flows.\n\nThe Group has closed all defined benefit pension schemes to new entrants. Defined benefit pension schemes remain operating\nin Australia, the United States, Canada and Europe for existing members. Full actuarial valuations are prepared and updated\nannually to 30 June by local actuaries for all schemes. The Group operates final salary schemes (that provide final salary benefits\nonly), non-salary related schemes (that provide flat dollar benefits) and mixed benefit schemes (that consist of a final salary\ndefined benefit portion and a defined contribution portion).\n\nDefined benefit The Group operates a number of post-retirement medical schemes in the United States, Canada and Europe and certain Group\n\npost-retirement companies provide post-retirement medical benefits to qualifying retirees. In some cases, the benefits are provided through\n\nmedical schemes medical care schemes to which the Group, the employees, the retirees and covered family members contribute. Full actuarial\nvaluations are prepared by local actuaries for all schemes. These schemes are recognised on the same basis as described for\ndefined benefit pension schemes. All of the post-retirement medical schemes in the Group are unfunded.\n\nDefined benefit The Group has a legal obligation to provide post-employment benefits to employees in Chile. The benefit is a function of an\npost-employment employee's final salary and years of service. These obligations are recognised on the same basis as described for defined\nobligations benefit pension schemes.\n\nFull actuarial valuations are prepared by local actuaries. These post-employment obligations are unfunded.\n\nRisk\nThe Group's defined benefit schemes/obligations expose the Group to a number of risks, including asset value volatility, interest rate variations, inflation,\nlongevity and medical expense inflation risk.\n\nRecognising this, the Group has adopted an approach of moving away from providing defined benefit pensions. The majority of Group-sponsored\ndefined benefit pension schemes have been closed to new entrants for many years. Existing benefit schemes and the terms of employee participation\nin these schemes are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nFund assets\n\nThe Group follows a coordinated strategy for the funding and investment of its defined benefit pension schemes (subject to meeting all local requirements).\nThe Group's aim is for the value of defined benefit pension scheme assets to be maintained at close to the value of the corresponding benefit obligations,\nallowing for some short-term volatility. Scheme assets are invested in a diversified range of asset classes, predominantly comprising bonds and equities.\n\nThe Group's aim is to progressively shift defined benefit pension scheme assets towards investments that match the anticipated profile of the benefit\nobligations, as funding levels improve and benefit obligations mature. Over time, this is expected to result in a further reduction in the total exposure\nof pension scheme assets to equity markets. For pension schemes that pay lifetime benefits, the Group may consider and support the purchase of\nannuities to back these benefit obligations if it is commercially sensible to do so.\n\nNet liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet\n\nThe net liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet is as follows:\nSSS SSS SSS SS\n\nDefined benefit\n\npension schemes/ Post-retirement\n\npost-employment obligations medical schemes\n2021 2020 2021 2020\nUS$M US$M US$M US$M\nPresent value of funded defined benefit obligation 377 613 - -\nPresent value of unfunded defined benefit obligation 358 354 197 214\nFair value of defined benefit scheme assets (398) (634) - -\nScheme deficit 337 333 197 214\nUnrecognised surplus - - - -\nUnrecognised past service credits - - - -\nAdjustment for employer contributions tax - - - -\nNet liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 337 333 197 214\n\nThe Group has no legal obligation to settle these liabilities with any immediate contributions or additional one-off contributions.

Our Scope of the Audit of BHP\n\nWhat we mean\n\nWe are required to establish an overall audit strategy that sets the scope, timing and direction of our audit, and that\nguides the development of our audit plan. Audit scope comprises the operated and non-operated assets, activities and\nprocesses to be audited that, in aggregate, provide sufficient coverage of the financial statements for us to express an\naudit opinion.\n\nCriteria for\ndetermining our\naudit scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk and our evaluation of materiality determined our audit scope for each location within\n\nBHP which, when taken together, enabled us to form an opinion on the financial statements under Australian Auditing\nStandards and ISAs (UK). Our audit effort was focused towards higher risk areas, such as management judgements and\nestimates, and on assets and group functions that we considered significant based upon size, complexity or risk.\n\nThe factors that we considered when assessing the scope of the audit, and the level of work to be performed at each\nasset or group function that were in scope for Group reporting purposes, included the following:\n\n- the financial significance to BHP’s earnings, total assets or total liabilities, including consideration of the financial\nsignificance of specific account balances or transactions;\n\n- the significance of specific risks relating to an asset or group function: history of unusual or complex transactions,\nidentification of significant audit issues or the potential for, or a history of, material misstatements; and\n\n- the effectiveness of the control environment and monitoring activities, including entity-level controls.\n\nFull and\nspecific scopes\n\nOf the 36 (2020: 36) assets and group functions (‘locations’), we selected 9 (2020: 10) locations based on their size or risk\ncharacteristics and performed full scope audits of the complete financial information at 4 (2020: 4) locations. Of the full\nscope locations, 3 (2020: 3) are the most significant assets within the Iron Ore, Copper and Coal segments. The additional\nfull scope location is the Group Treasury Function. For the other 5 (2020: 6) locations we performed specific scope audit\nprocedures on individual account balances within the location based on their size and risk profiles. The audit scope of\nthese components may not have included testing of all significant accounts of the component but will have contributed\nto the coverage of significant accounts tested for the Group.\n\nSpecified and\nGroup procedures\n\nSpecified\n\nIn addition to the 9 full and specific scope locations above, we selected 15 (2020: 10) locations to perform procedures\nspecified by the group audit team in response to specific risk factors and in order to ensure that, at the overall Group level,\nwe reduced and appropriately covered the residual risk of error.\n\nCentralised group functions\n\nFor full and specific scope locations, as well as specified procedures locations, we have performed procedures over\ncertain accounts by testing group functions which have centralised processes for revenue and accounts receivables,\npurchase to pay, treasury, property, plant and equipment, employee benefits, right of use assets and lease liabilities\nand the elimination of intercompany balances.\n\nGroup wide procedures\n\nWe performed centralised procedures across the entire Group, including IT general and IT application controls over\nthe 1SAP IT system and audit of manual and consolidation journal entries.

Our Scope of the Audit of BHP continued\nIntegrated EY Australia and EY UK operate as one integrated group audit team which was responsible for the direction and supervision\nglobal primary of the group audit engagement in compliance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nteam and their This integrated group audit team established the overall group audit strategy, communicated with component teams,\ninvolvement with EY performed work on the consolidation process, and evaluated the conclusions drawn from the audit evidence as the basis for\ncomponent teams forming the opinions on the financial statements. Audit instructions outlined the significant audit areas, performance materiality\n\nthresholds, which ranged from US$169 million to US$540 million, and specific reporting requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of the Group audit, the integrated group audit team was responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating\nand reviewing the work of EY global network firms operating under their instruction (local EY teams) to assess whether:\n\n- the work was performed and documented to a sufficiently high standard;\n\n- the local EY audit team demonstrated that they had challenged management sufficiently and had executed their audit\nprocedures with a sufficient level of scepticism; and\n\n- there was sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support the conclusions reached.\n\nEach in-scope location has a local EY audit team led by a partner. Our in-scope locations cover four geographical\nlocations, being Australia, Chile, United States and Singapore. These local audit teams were supported by an audit team\nin Malaysia and the Philippines performing procedures over centralised group functions.\n\nThe Group audit team interacted regularly with the local EY teams during each stage of the audit, were responsible for the\nscope and direction of the audit process and reviewed key working papers. This, together with the additional procedures\nperformed at the group level, gave us sufficient appropriate audit evidence for our opinion on BHP’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nImpacts of COVID-19 on Group audit team involvement with EY component teams\nDue to the global COVID-19 pandemic and the international travel restrictions, the Group audit team visits were restricted.\n\nConsistent with our monitoring approach, since the global pandemic was announced in March 2020, we maintained continuous\ndialogue with our local EY teams. This included: meetings with our component teams and local BHP management via video\nconference and performing remote review of the key workpapers associated with the component teams’ audit procedures.\n\nWe attended all meetings with our component teams and local BHP management to conclude the audit procedures at each\nlocation by phone or videoconference, to ensure that we were fully aware of their progress and results of their audit procedures.\n\nIn certain locations, the performance of the year end audit was also required to be conducted remotely due to COVID-19\nrestrictions and social distancing requirements at both component and Group locations. This was supported through\nremote access to the Group’s financial systems and the use of EY software collaboration platforms for the secure and\ntimely delivery of requested audit evidence.\n\n5. Our consideration of climate change related risks\n\nThe financial impacts on the Group of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy (\"climate change”) were considered in our audit\nwhere they have the potential to directly or indirectly impact key judgements and estimates within the financial statements.\n\nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change which is currently premised upon two scenarios; the Central\nEnergy View and the Lower Carbon view, as explained in the Climate change section within the Basis of preparation of the financial statements.\n\nClimate risks have the potential to materially impact the key judgements and estimates within the financial report. Our audit considered those\nrisks that could be material to the key judgement and estimates in the assessment of the carrying value of non-current assets and closure and\nrehabilitation provisions.\n\nThe key judgements and estimates included in the financial statements incorporate actions and strategies, to the extent they have been approved\nand can be reliably estimated in accordance with the Group's accounting policies.\n\nAccordingly, our key audit matters address how we have assessed the Group's climate related assumptions to the extent they impact each key audit\nmatter. Our audit procedures were performed with the involvement of our climate change and valuation specialists.\n6. Our application of materiality\n\nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in\nforming our audit opinions.\n\nMateriality\n\nWhat we mean The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to\ninfluence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining\nthe nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nBasis of Materiality We determined materiality for the Group to be US$900 million, which is approximately 5% of the three-year average\n\nand determination Group profit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations. In 2020, our first-year audit of the Group, we\n\nused a materiality threshold of US$700 million, which was approximately 5% of the Group’s 30 June 2020 profit before\ntax and exceptional items from continuing operations. We believe that a three-year average of Group profit before tax\nand exceptional items from continuing operations provides the most relevant measure to the users to assess the financial\nperformance of the Group due to the volatility in commodity prices impacting current levels of profitability. Had we\nbased our assessment of materiality on the same basis as 2020, the 2021 materiality would have been in excess of\nUS$900 million. Exceptional items are defined in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$80 million (2020: US$95 million), which is 1% of total assets.\nTotal assets is an appropriate basis to determine materiality for an investment holding company, and 1% is a typical\npercentage of total assets to use to determine materiality.\n\nDuring the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and considered it to still be appropriate based on the\n\nfinal profit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations.\n\nBHP | Annual Report 2021 209\n", "vlm_text": "The table provides information about the integrated group audit team of EY (Ernst & Young) Australia and EY UK, detailing how they operate together for the direction and supervision of the group audit engagement in compliance with professional standards and legal requirements. It outlines their responsibilities, such as establishing the overall group audit strategy, communicating with component teams, and evaluating conclusions drawn from audit evidence to form opinions on financial statements. \n\nThe table specifies that the group audit team was responsible for directing, supervising, evaluating, and reviewing the work of local EY teams in different geographical locations—Australia, Chile, United States, and Singapore—with additional support from teams in Malaysia and the Philippines. It highlights the importance of high-standard performance, sufficient scepticism in management challenges, and adequate audit evidence.\n\nFurthermore, it discusses the impact of COVID-19, emphasizing changes in the group audit team’s operations, such as restrictions on travel and the shift to remote audits and meetings via phone or videoconference. Despite these challenges, they continued their audit processes to ensure compliance and accuracy in financial statement reviews.\n5.  Our consideration of climate change related risks  \nThe financial impacts on the Group of climate change and the transition to a low carbon economy (“climate change”) were considered in our audit  where they have the potential to directly or indirectly impact key judgements and estimates within the financial statements. \nThe Group continues to develop its assessment of the potential impacts of climate change which is currently premised upon two scenarios; the Central  Energy View and the Lower Carbon view, as explained in the Climate change section within the Basis of preparation of the financial statements.  \nClimate risks have the potential to materially impact the key judgements and estimates within the financial report.

Our audit procedures were performed with the involvement of our climate change and valuation specialists.  \n6.  Our application of materiality  \nWe apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in  forming our audit opinions.  \nMateriality \nThe table appears to describe the concept of materiality and how it is determined in the context of financial statement audits. It consists of two main sections:\n\n1. **What we mean**: This section defines materiality as the magnitude of an omission or misstatement that could influence the economic decisions of users of the financial statements. It states that materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of audit procedures.\n\n2. **Basis of Materiality and determination**: This section explains the determination of materiality levels for both the Group and the Parent Company. \n   - For the Group, materiality is set at US$900 million, approximately 5% of the three-year average profit before tax and exceptional items from continuing operations. In 2020, a materiality threshold of US$700 million was used, which was about 5% of the Group’s mid-2020 profit before these items. The section explains why a three-year average is used, and notes that had the same basis been applied as in 2020, the 2021 materiality would have exceeded US$900 million.\n   - For the Parent Company, materiality is determined to be US$80 million (2020: US$95 million), which is 1% of total assets. The section justifies that total assets are an appropriate basis for an investment holding company, and 1% is a typical percentage used. During the audit, initial materiality was reassessed and considered still appropriate."}

However, because not all future events or conditions can  be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s and  Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. \n9.2  EY UK’s opinion on other matters prescribed by the UK  Companies Act 2006 \nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\n\n –\t the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report  for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared  is consistent with the financial statements; and \n\n –\t the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared  in accordance with applicable legal requirements. \n9.3  EY UK’s Corporate Governance Statement \nThe Listing Rules require us to review the directors’ statement in relation  to going concern, longer-term viability and that part of the Corporate  Governance Statement relating to the Group’s and Parent Company’s  compliance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  specified for our review. \nBased on the work undertaken as part of our audit, we have concluded  that each of the following elements of the Corporate Governance  Statement is materially consistent with the financial statements or  our knowledge obtained during the audit:\n\n \n–\t Directors’ statement with regards to the appropriateness of adopting  the going concern basis of accounting and any material uncertainties  identified set out in section 2.3.3;\n\n –\t Directors’ explanation as to its assessment of the company’s  prospects, the period this assessment covers and why the period  is appropriate set out in section 2.1.10;\n\n –\t Directors’ statement on fair, balanced and understandable set out  in section 2.1.10;\n\n –\t Board’s confirmation that it has carried out a robust assessment of  the emerging and principal risks set out in sections 1.10, 2.1.5, 2.1.10  and 2.1.11;\n\n –\t The section of the Annual Report that describes the review of  effectiveness of risk management and internal control systems set  out in section 2.1.10; and\n\n –\t The section describing the work of the Risk and Audit Committee  set out in section set out in section 2.1.10. \n10.  Other matters which EY UK is required to report  by exception \nIn section 10 ‘we’ and ‘our’ refer to EY UK only. \nIn light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the  Parent Company and its environment obtained in the course of the  audit, EY UK has not identified material misstatements in the strategic  report or the directors’ report. \nEY UK has nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation  to which the UK Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if,  in our opinion:\n\n \n–\t adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent  Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received  from branches not visited by us; or\n\n –\t the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the  Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the  accounting records and returns; or\n\n –\t certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are  not made; or\n\n –\t we have not received all the information and explanations we require  for our audit. \n11.  Responsibilities of directors \nAs explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set  out in section 3.4, the directors of the Group are responsible for the  preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that  they give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial  reporting frameworks, and for such internal control as the directors  determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements  that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,  whether due to fraud or error.  \nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible  for assessing the Group and Parent Company’s ability to continue as  a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going  concern and using the going concern basis of accounting, unless the  directors either intend to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company  or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities,\noutlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not\ndetecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of\nnot detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate\nconcealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations,\nor through collusion\n\nThe extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting\nirregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary\nresponsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both\nthose charged with governance of the company and management.\n\nOur approach was as follows:\n\n- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory\nframeworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that\nthe most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework\n(including IFRSs, Australian Accounting Standards, the Australian\nCorporations Act 2007, International Accounting Standards adopted\nfor use within the UK, UK Companies Act 2006, the UK Corporate\nGovernance Code, the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\nthe Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority) and the relevant tax\ncompliance regulations in the jurisdictions in which BHP operates.\nIn addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws\nand regulations that may have an effect on the determination of the\namounts and disclosures in the financial statements, mainly relating\nto health and safety, employee matters, bribery and corruption\npractices, environmental and certain aspects of company legislation\nrecognising the regulated nature of the Group's mining and oil and\ngas activities and its legal form.\n\n- We understood how BHP is complying with those frameworks\nby making enquiries of management, internal audit, those\nresponsible for legal and compliance procedures and the Company\nSecretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of\nBoard minutes, papers provided to the Group's Risk and Audit\nCommittee and the Sustainability Committee and correspondence\nreceived from regulatory bodies and noted that there was no\ncontradictory evidence.\n\n- Weassessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to\nmaterial misstatement, including how fraud might occur. Our forensic\nspecialists reviewed the BHP Ethics and Compliance fraud analytics,\nwhich were undertaken to respond to the risk of potential fraudulent or\ncorrupt payments made to third parties. We also considered the risk of\nfraud through management override and, in response, incorporated\ndata analytics across manual journal entries into our audit approach.\n\n- Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures\nto identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations.\n\nOur procedures involved journal entry testing, with a focus on journals\nmeeting our defined risk criteria based on our understanding of\n\nthe business; enquiries of the legal counsel, external legal advisers,\ngroup management, internal audit and all full and specific scope\nmanagement; review of Board and Risk and Audit Committee\nreporting and review of the volume and nature of complaints received\nby the EthicsPoint anonymous reporting service during the year.\n\n- If any instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations\nwere identified, these were communicated to the relevant local EY\nteams who performed sufficient and appropriate audit procedures,\nsupplemented by audit procedures performed at the Group level.\n\n- We ensured our global audit team has deep industry experience\nthrough working for many years on relevant audits, including\nexperience of mining and oil and gas. Our audit planning included\nconsidering external market factors, for example geopolitical risk, the\npotential impact of climate change, commodity price risk and major\ntrends in the industry.\n\n13.2 Other matters\n\n- Following the recommendation from the Risk and Audit Committee\nwe were appointed by the company on 7 November 2019 to audit\nthe financial statements for the year ending 30 June 2020 and\nsubsequent financial periods.

A development well is a well drilled within the limits of a known oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known  to be productive.  \nA productive well is an exploratory, development or extension well that is not a dry well. Productive wells include wells in which hydrocarbons were  encountered and the drilling or completion of which, in the case of exploratory wells, has been suspended pending further drilling or evaluation.  A dry well (hole) is an exploratory, development, or extension well that proves to be incapable of producing either oil or gas in sufficient quantities  to justify completion as an oil or gas well.

Reserves are a subset of\nresources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and\nlegally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required\nabout a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities,\nqualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and\ntransport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and\nexchange rates.\n\nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape\nand depth of ore bodies or oil and gas reservoirs to be determined by\nanalysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical\nsurvey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves\nchange from period to period as additional technical and operational data\nis generated.\n\n4.6.1 Petroleum reserves\n\nEstimates of oil and gas reserves involve some degree of uncertainty, are\ninherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject\nto future revision. Accordingly, financial and accounting measures (such\nas the standardised measure of discounted cash flows, depreciation,\ndepletion and amortisation charges, the assessment of impairments and\nthe assessment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets) that\nare based on reserve estimates are also subject to change.\n\nHow we estimate and report reserves\n\nPetroleum’s reserves are estimated as of 30 June each year.\n\nReported reserves include both Conventional Petroleum reserves\n\nand Onshore US reserves for FY2018 and are included in the opening\nbalances in the accompanying tables. Footnotes have been included\nwith the tables to identify the contribution of the Discontinued operations\n(Onshore US) for this period. The sale of Petroleum’s interests in Onshore\nUS reserves was completed in FY2019. Remaining reserves at the end of\nFY2019, FY2020 and FY2021 reflect the Continuing operations only.\n\nOur proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest\nbasis according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)\nregulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule\n4-10(a) of Regulation S-x.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural\n\ngas and natural gas liquids (NGL) that, by analysis of geoscience and\nengineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be\neconomically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs\nand under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating\ncontracts and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that\nrenewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain, estimates\nof economically producible reserves reflect only the period before the\ncontracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have\ncommenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will\ncommence within a reasonable time. As specified in SEC Rule 4-10(a) of\nRegulation S-x, oil and gas prices are taken as the unweighted average of\nthe corresponding first day of the month prices for the 12 months prior to\nthe ending date of the period covered\n\nProved reserves were estimated by reference to available well and\nreservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data,\ncore data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data\n\nand in some cases, to similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs.\nAwide range of engineering and geoscience methods, including\nperformance analysis, numerical simulation, well analogues and geologic\nstudies were used to estimate high confidence proved developed and\nundeveloped reserves in accordance with SEC regulations.\n\nAdditional\nInformation\n\nProved reserve estimates were attributed to future development projects\nonly where there is a significant commitment to project funding and\nexecution and for which applicable government and regulatory approvals\nhave been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured. Furthermore,\nestimates of proved reserves include only volumes for which access to\nmarket is assured with reasonable certainty. All proved reserve estimates\nare subject to revision (either upward or downward) based on new\ninformation, such as from development drilling and production activities\nor from changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract\nterms or development plans.\n\nDeveloped oil and gas reserves\n\nProved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected\nto be recovered through:\n\n- existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods\n\n- installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the\ntime of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving\nawell\n\nPerformance-derived reserve assessments for producing wells were\nprimarily based on the following manner:\n\n- for our conventional operations, reserves were estimated using rate and\npressure decline methods, including material balance, supplemented\nby reservoir simulation models where appropriate\n\n- for our Discontinued operations (Onshore US) reported for FY2018,\nreserves were estimated using rate-transient analysis and decline curve\nanalysis methods\n\n- for wells that lacked sufficient production history, reserves were\nestimated using performance-based type curves and offset location\nanalogues with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics\n\nProved undeveloped reserves\n\nProved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected\nto be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage where commitment\nhas been made to commence development within five years from first\nreporting or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is\nrequired for recompletion.\n\nA combination of geologic and engineering data and where appropriate,\nstatistical analysis was used to support the assignment of proved\nundeveloped reserves when assessing planned drilling locations.\nPerformance data along with log and core data was used to delineate\nconsistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in core areas of the\ndevelopment. Proved undeveloped locations were included in core\nareas between known data and adjacent to productive wells using\nperformance-based type curves and offset location analogues with\nsimilar geologic and reservoir characteristics.

Reserves are a subset of  resources that can be demonstrated to be able to be economically and  legally extracted. In order to estimate reserves, assumptions are required  about a range of technical and economic factors, including quantities,  qualities, production techniques, recovery efficiency, production and  transport costs, commodity supply and demand, commodity prices and  exchange rates.  \nEstimating the quantity and/or quality of reserves requires the size, shape  and depth of ore bodies or oil and gas reservoirs to be determined by  analysing geological data, such as drilling samples and geophysical  survey interpretations. Economic assumptions used to estimate reserves  change from period to period as additional technical and operational data  is generated. \n4.6.1   Petroleum reserves \nEstimates of oil and gas reserves involve some degree of uncertainty, are  inherently imprecise, require the application of judgement and are subject  to future revision. Accordingly, financial and accounting measures (such  as the standardised measure of discounted cash flows, depreciation,  depletion and amortisation charges, the assessment of impairments and  the assessment of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets) that  are based on reserve estimates are also subject to change.  \nHow we estimate and report reserves  \nPetroleum’s reserves are estimated as of 30 June each year.  Reported reserves include both Conventional Petroleum reserves  and Onshore US reserves for FY2018 and are included in the opening  balances in the accompanying tables. Footnotes have been included  with the tables to identify the contribution of the Discontinued operations  (Onshore US) for this period. The sale of Petroleum’s interests in Onshore  US reserves was completed in FY2019. Remaining reserves at the end of  FY2019, FY2020 and FY2021 reflect the Continuing operations only.  \nOur proved reserves are estimated and reported on a net interest  basis according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  regulations and have been determined in accordance with SEC Rule  4-10(a) of Regulation  $\\mathsf{S-X}$  .  \nProved oil and gas reserves  \nProved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of crude oil, natural  gas and natural gas liquids (NGL) that, by analysis of geoscience and  engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be  economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, operating  contracts and government regulations. Unless evidence indicates that  renewal of existing operating contracts is reasonably certain, estimates  of economically producible reserves reflect only the period before the  contracts expire. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have  commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will  commence within a reasonable time. As specified in SEC Rule 4-10(a) of  Regulation  $\\mathsf{S-X},$  , oil and gas prices are taken as the unweighted average of  the corresponding first day of the month prices for the 12 months prior to  the ending date of the period covered.  \nProved reserves were estimated by reference to available well and  reservoir information, including but not limited to well logs, well test data,  core data, production and pressure data, geologic data, seismic data  and in some cases, to similar data from analogous, producing reservoirs.  A wide range of engineering and geoscience methods, including  performance analysis, numerical simulation, well analogues and geologic  studies were used to estimate high confidence proved developed and  undeveloped reserves in accordance with SEC regulations.  \nProved reserve estimates were attributed to future development projects  only where there is a significant commitment to project funding and  execution and for which applicable government and regulatory approvals  have been secured or are reasonably certain to be secured. Furthermore,  estimates of proved reserves include only volumes for which access to  market is assured with reasonable certainty. All proved reserve estimates  are subject to revision (either upward or downward) based on new  information, such as from development drilling and production activities  or from changes in economic factors, including product prices, contract  terms or development plans.  \nDeveloped oil and gas reserves  \nProved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected  to be recovered through:\n\n \n–\t existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods\n\n –\t installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the  time of the reserve estimate if the extraction is by means not involving  a well  Performance-derived reserve assessments for producing wells were  primarily based on the following manner: \n\n –\t for our conventional operations, reserves were estimated using rate and  pressure decline methods, including material balance, supplemented  by reservoir simulation models where appropriate\n\n –\t for our Discontinued operations (Onshore US) reported for FY2018,  reserves were estimated using rate-transient analysis and decline curve  analysis methods\n\n –\t for wells that lacked sufficient production history, reserves were  estimated using performance-based type curves and offset location  analogues with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics \nProved undeveloped reserves  \nProved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected  to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage where commitment  has been made to commence development within five years from first  reporting or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is  required for recompletion.  \nA combination of geologic and engineering data and where appropriate,  statistical analysis was used to support the assignment of proved  undeveloped reserves when assessing planned drilling locations.  Performance data along with log and core data was used to delineate  consistent, continuous reservoir characteristics in core areas of the  development. Proved undeveloped locations were included in core  areas between known data and adjacent to productive wells using  performance-based type curves and offset location analogues with  similar geologic and reservoir characteristics. Locations where a  high degree of certainty could not be demonstrated using the above  technologies and techniques were not categorised as proved.  \nMethodology used to estimate reserves  \nReserves have been estimated with deterministic methodology, with  the exception of the North West Shelf gas operation in Australia,  where probabilistic methodology has been used to estimate and  aggregate reserves for the reservoirs dedicated to the gas project only.  The probabilistic-based portion of these reserves totals 6 million barrels  of oil equivalent (MMboe) in FY2021, 12 MMboe in FY2020 and 16 MMboe  in FY2019. These amounts represent approximately 1 per cent of our total  reported proved reserves in FY2021, and approximately 2 per cent in each  of FY2020 and FY2019. Total boe conversion is based on the following:  6,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of natural gas equals 1 boe. Aggregation of  proved reserves beyond the field/project level has been performed by  arithmetic summation. Due to portfolio effects, aggregates of proved  reserves may be conservative. The custody transfer point(s) or point(s)  of sale applicable for each field or project are the reference point for  reserves. The reserves replacement ratio is the change in reserves during  the year excluding production, divided by the production during the year  and stated as a percentage.  "}

This represents a decrease of 38 MMboe from\nthe 238 MMboe at 30 June 2020.\n\nDuring FY2021, a total of 44 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves\nwere converted to proved developed reserves through development\nactivities. This was driven by the following four projects: the Barracouta\nWest development in the Bass Strait in Australia (14 MMboe), a gas\ndelivery pressure and compressor re-staging study in the Macedon\nfield in Offshore Western Australia (14 MMboe) and the Atlantis Phase\n3 development in the US Gulf of Mexico (14 MMboe). Start-up of the\nRuby development project in Offshore Trinidad and Tobago also\nconverted 3 MMboe to proved developed with first oil production.\nIncreases to proved undeveloped reserves included approval of the\nShenzi Subsurface Multi-Phase Pump project which added 6 MMboe.\nThe effect of commodity prices relative to FY2020 resulted in the\naddition of 5 MMboe to proved undeveloped reserves while the\nacquisition of additional interest in the Shenzi field in the US Gulf\n\nof Mexico increased proved undeveloped reserves by 3 MMboe.\nTechnical studies, revisions to expected performance and other\nchanges reduced proved undeveloped reserves by 2 Mmboe.\n\nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped\nreserves to developed status has totalled 93 MMboe, averaging\n31MMboe per year. At 30 June 2021, a total of 114 MMboe proved\nundeveloped reserves have been reported for five or more years.\nApproximately 101 MMboe of this amount is associated with the Mad Dog\nPhase 2 development which is anticipated to produce first oil in CY2022.\nThe remaining 13 MMboe is in our currently producing fields and will be\ndeveloped and brought on stream in a phased manner to best optimise\nthe use of production facilities and to meet sales commitments.\n\nDuring FY2021, Petroleum spent US$11 billion on development activities\nworldwide. Of this amount:\n\n- US$0.9 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved\nundeveloped reserves for projects where developed status was\nachieved in FY2021 or will be achieved when development is\ncompleted in the future\n\n- US$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures,\nincluding compliance and infrastructure improvement\n\nFY2020 proved undeveloped reserves\n\nAt 30 June 2020, Petroleum had 238 MMboe of proved undeveloped\nreserves, which corresponds to 32 per cent of the reported proved\nreserves of 748 MMboe. This represents an increase of 19 MMboe from\nthe 219 MMboe at 30 June 2019.\n\nThe most significant drivers of this increase were the additions of\n19 MMboe for the Ruby development project in Offshore Trinidad\nand Tobago and 12 MMboe for the Greater Western Flank Phase 3\ndevelopment project in Australia as extensions and discoveries.\n\nReclassifications from proved undeveloped to proved developed\noccurred in Australia in the Macedon field (7 MMboe), the Cobia field in\nBass Strait (2 MMboe) and in the Offshore US Gulf of Mexico in the Mad\nDog Spar A field (8 MMboe). In the Shenzi field, the need to perform\n\na producer redrill resulted in the reclassification of 4 MMboe proved\ndeveloped into proved undeveloped.\n\nIn Australia, in the Bass Strait, 18 MMboe was moved into proved\nundeveloped for the Turrum field as a result of the reservoir performance\nreassessment, while in the Kipper field, a reduction of the gas delivery\npressure requirements enabled more gas to be delivered prior to the\ninstallation of compression. This resulted in the movement of 16 MMboe\nfrom proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Bass Strait\nproved undeveloped fuel was also increased by 3 MMboe as a result of\n\na fuel utilisation study. Performance revisions in the Mad Dog Spar A and\nthe Shenzi fields in the US Gulf of Mexico reduced proved undeveloped\nby 6 MMboe.\n\nLower commodity prices resulted in a 4 MMboe reduction to proved\nundeveloped reserves.\n\nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves\nto developed status has totalled 98 MMboe, averaging 33 MMboe per\nyear. At 30 June 2020, a total of 30 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves\nhave been reported for five or more years. These reserves are in our\ncurrently producing fields and will be developed and brought on stream\n\nin a phased manner to best optimise the use of production facilities and to\nmeet sales commitments. During FY2020, Petroleum spent US$1.0 billion\non development activities worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n- US$0.8 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved\nundeveloped reserves for conventional projects where developed\nstatus was achieved in FY2020 or will be achieved when development\nis completed in the future\n\n- US$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures, including\ncompliance and infrastructure improvements\n\nFY2019 proved undeveloped reserves\n\nAt 30 June 2019, Petroleum had 219 MMboe of proved undeveloped\nreserves, which corresponds to 26 per cent of the reported proved reserves\nof 841 MMboe. This represents a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves\nof 202 MMboe from the 421 MMboe at 30 June 2018. The largest element\nof this reduction was 185 MMboe, which occurred with the divestment\n\nof unconventional Onshore US assets. A reclassification from proved\nundeveloped to proved developed status of approximately 40 MMboe\n\nthat occurred in the North West Shelf, Australia, with the completion\n\nof development and the start of production from the Greater Western\n\nFlank Phase B project, also contributed to the reduction. An additional\n\n1 MMboe was also reclassified from proved undeveloped to proved\ndeveloped status with the completion of an infill well in the ROD integrated\ndevelopment in Algeria. Partially offsetting these reductions were revisions\nfor technical studies of 1O MMboe for the Kipper field in the Bass Strait,\nAustralia. Additions following the approval of the Atlantis Phase 3 project\n\nin the Offshore US Gulf of Mexico added 8 MMboe for development\n\nplan changes, 7 MMboe for performance and 1 MMboe as an extension.\n\nA performance reduction of 2 MMboe in the Mad Dog field partially\n\noffset the Atlantis performance addition.\n\nThe changes in proved undeveloped reserves in FY2021, FY2020\nand FY2019 are summarised by change category in the table below.\nAdditional information detailing the effect of price, performance,\nchanges in capital development plans and technical studies are\nalso provided for revisions.\n\nYear Ended 30 June\nProved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD) Reconciliation (MMboe)” 2021 2020 2019\nPUD Opening Balance 238 219 421\nRevisions of Previous Estimates (41) (12) (18)\nReclassifications to developed (44) (8) (42)\nPerformance, Technical Studies and Other (2) (1) 16\nDevelopment Plan Changes - (0) 8\nPrice 5 4) —\nExtensions/Discoveries - 31 1\nAcquisitions/Sales 3 - (185)\nTotal Change (38) 19 (202)\nPUD Closing Balance 200 238 219\n\n(a) Small differences are due to rounding.\n\n252 | BHP | AnnualReport 2021\n", "vlm_text": "FY2021 proved undeveloped reserves \nAt 30 June 2021, Petroleum had 200 MMboe of proved undeveloped  reserves, which corresponds to 30 per cent of the reported proved  reserves of 665 MMboe.

The effect of commodity prices relative to FY2020 resulted in the  addition of 5 MMboe to proved undeveloped reserves while the  acquisition of additional interest in the Shenzi field in the US Gulf  of Mexico increased proved undeveloped reserves by 3 MMboe.  Technical studies, revisions to expected performance and other  changes reduced proved undeveloped reserves by 2 Mmboe. \nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped  reserves to developed status has totalled 93 MMboe, averaging  31 MMboe per year. At 30 June 2021, a total of 114 MMboe proved  undeveloped reserves have been reported for five or more years.  Approximately 101 MMboe of this amount is associated with the Mad Dog  Phase 2 development which is anticipated to produce first oil in CY2022.  The remaining 13 MMboe is in our currently producing fields and will be  developed and brought on stream in a phased manner to best optimise  the use of production facilities and to meet sales commitments.  \nDuring FY2021, Petroleum spent US\\$1.1 billion on development activities  worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n \n–\t US\\$0.9 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved  undeveloped reserves for projects where developed status was  achieved in FY2021 or will be achieved when development is  completed in the future\n\n –\t US\\$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures,  including compliance and infrastructure improvement \nFY2020 proved undeveloped reserves \nAt 30 June 2020, Petroleum had 238 MMboe of proved undeveloped  reserves, which corresponds to 32 per cent of the reported proved  reserves of 748 MMboe. This represents an increase of 19 MMboe from  the 219 MMboe at 30 June 2019.  \nThe most significant drivers of this increase were the additions of  19 MMboe for the Ruby development project in Offshore Trinidad  and Tobago and 12 MMboe for the Greater Western Flank Phase 3  development project in Australia as extensions and discoveries.  \nReclassification s from proved undeveloped to proved developed  occurred in Australia in the Macedon field (7 MMboe), the Cobia field in  Bass Strait (2 MMboe) and in the Offshore US Gulf of Mexico in the Mad  Dog Spar A field (3 MMboe). In the Shenzi field, the need to perform  a producer redrill resulted in the reclassification of 4 MMboe proved  developed into proved undeveloped.  \n\nIn Australia, in the Bass Strait, 18 MMboe was moved into proved  undeveloped for the Turrum field as a result of the reservoir performance  reassessment, while in the Kipper field, a reduction of the gas delivery  pressure requirements enabled more gas to be delivered prior to the  installation of compression. This resulted in the movement of 16 MMboe  from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves. Bass Strait  proved undeveloped fuel was also increased by 3 MMboe as a result of  a fuel utilisation study. Performance revisions in the Mad Dog Spar A and  the Shenzi fields in the US Gulf of Mexico reduced proved undeveloped  by 6 MMboe. \nLower commodity prices resulted in a 4 MMboe reduction to proved  undeveloped reserves. \nOver the past three years, the conversion of proved undeveloped reserves  to developed status has totalled 98 MMboe, averaging 33 MMboe per  year. At 30 June 2020, a total of 30 MMboe proved undeveloped reserves  have been reported for five or more years. These reserves are in our  currently producing fields and will be developed and brought on stream  in a phased manner to best optimise the use of production facilities and to  meet sales commitments. During FY2020, Petroleum spent   $\\cup\\mathbb{S}\\Phi1.0$  billion  on development activities worldwide. Of this amount:\n\n \n–\t US\\$0.8 billion was spent progressing the conversion of proved  undeveloped reserves for conventional projects where developed  status was achieved in FY2020 or will be achieved when development  is completed in the future\n\n \n–\t US\\$0.2 billion represented other development expenditures, including  compliance and infrastructure improvements \nFY2019 proved undeveloped reserves \nAt 30 June 2019, Petroleum had 219 MMboe of proved undeveloped  reserves, which corresponds to 26 per cent of the reported proved reserves  of 841 MMboe. This represents a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves  of 202 MMboe from the 421 MMboe at 30 June 2018. The largest element  of this reduction was 185 MMboe, which occurred with the divestment  of unconventional Onshore US assets. A reclassification from proved  undeveloped to proved developed status of approximately 40 MMboe  that occurred in the North West Shelf, Australia, with the completion  of development and the start of production from the Greater Western  Flank Phase B project, also contributed to the reduction. An additional  1 MMboe was also reclassified from proved undeveloped to proved  developed status with the completion of an infill well in the ROD integrated  development in Algeria. Partially offsetting these reductions were revisions  for technical studies of 10 MMboe for the Kipper field in the Bass Strait,  Australia. Additions following the approval of the Atlantis Phase 3 project  in the Offshore US Gulf of Mexico added 8 MMboe for development  plan changes, 7 MMboe for performance and 1 MMboe as an extension.  A performance reduction of 2 MMboe in the Mad Dog field partially  offset the Atlantis performance addition.  \nThe changes in proved undeveloped reserves in FY2021, FY2020  and FY2019 are summarised by change category in the table below.  Additional information detailing the effect of price, performance,  changes in capital development plans and technical studies are  also provided for revisions. \nThe table presents a reconciliation of Proved Undeveloped Reserves (PUD) measured in million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) over three financial years ending on June 30 for 2021, 2020, and 2019.

For Samarco the cut-off grade was   $22\\%\\mathsf{F e}$  .\n\n (3)\t WAIO – Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are reported on a Pilbara basis by ore type to align with our production of blended lump products which comprises BKM, BKM Bene and MM ore  types and blended fines products including CID. This also reflects our single logistics chain and associated management system.\n\n (4)\t WAIO – BHP interest is reported as Pilbara Ore Reserves tonnes weighted average across all joint ventures which can vary from year to year. BHP ownership varies between  $85\\%$   and   $100\\%$  .\n\n (5)\t WAIO – First time reporting of DID ore type.\n\n (6)\t WAIO – The increase in Mineral Resources was due to updated resource estimates supported by additional drilling partially offset by depletion.\n\n (7)\t WAIO – Mineral Resources are restricted to areas which have been identified for inclusion based on a risk assessment, including heritage sites.\n\n (8)\t Samarco – The decrease in Mineral Resources was due to changes in geotechnical parameters and increased stand-off distances from natural drainage. Operations have recommenced  and an Ore Reserves estimate is in progress.\n\n (9)\t Approximate drill hole spacings used to classify the reserves were:\n\n \nThe table displays information about a deposit labeled \"WAIO.\" It includes two categories of reserves: \n\n1.

Ore delivered to process facility.\n\n (13)\t WAIO – Ore Reserves are all located on State Agreement mining leases that guarantee the right to mine. Across WAIO, State Government approvals (including environmental and heritage  clearances) are required before commencing mining operations in a particular area. Included in the Ore Reserves are select areas where one or more approvals remain outstanding, but  where, based on the technical investigations carried out as part of the mine planning process and company knowledge and experience of the approvals process, it is expected that such  approvals will be obtained as part of the normal course of business and within the time frame required by the current mine schedule.\n\n (14)\t WAIO – The decrease in CID ore type was due to depletion.

As per BHP’s  Our Requirements  for Environment and Climate Change  standard baseline biodiversity studies were undertaken prior to exploration activities to identify key species  and habitats. The mitigation hierarchy was implemented to avoid, minimise and rehabilitate impacts from the activities. Due to the small amount of  disturbance over a short time period, species potentially impacted by these activities are not included. \nThe table provides information about various operated assets in different locations and the impact these operations have on species listed under the IUCN and national categories. The columns detail the location, name of the operated asset, the commodity being extracted or utilized, and the number of affected species categorized under IUCN and national listings. The species categories include critically endangered, endangered, vulnerable, near threatened, and least concern.\n\nFor example, the table shows that in Western Australia, the WAIO asset, which deals with iron ore, affects 3 critically endangered IUCN species and 4 nationally critically endangered species. The table lists information for assets in various regions, such as Australia, Canada, the United States, Central America, and Chile. Each row provides data on the number of species in each threat category for the corresponding location and operated asset."}

Type 1 and Type 2 equate to  high-quality water, while Type 3 equates to low-quality water under the  International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Guidelines. \nIn FY2021, BHP commenced use of the WWF Water Risk Filter (1)  for our  disclosures of basin risk for our operated assets. Using the WWF Water  Risk Filter, it was found that two of our operated assets (approximately  18 per cent), as of the end of FY2021, are classified as being under high  or very high water stress due to location. These are shown in the Asset  Summary Table. \nWater withdrawals \nWater withdrawals represent the volume of water, in megalitres (ML)  received and intended for use by the operated asset from the water  environment and/or a third-party supplier.  Third-party water  withdrawals were reported by source in prior years however from  FY2021 we have reported as a distinct category to align with reporting  frameworks such as ICMM guidelines and GRI.  \nThe image is a stacked bar chart depicting water withdrawals from different sources over the fiscal years 2017 to 2021. The y-axis represents the volume of water in megalitres, ranging from 0 to 450,000. Each year from 2017 to 2021 is represented on the x-axis. The chart breaks down the water withdrawals into four categories, each with a distinct color: Seawater (orange), Groundwater (dark orange), Surface water (grey), and Third-party water (blue). In 2021, seawater makes up the largest portion of water withdrawals, followed by groundwater, surface water, and finally third-party water. The overall trend indicates a general increase in water withdrawals across the years, with the highest total observed in 2021.\n(3)\t Volumes of withdrawal by source have been updated for FY2019, FY2018 and FY2017 for  the Nickel West operated asset at Kwinana. Previously, the total volumes of water suppled  to the site by a third party, Water Corporation, was proportionately to source in alignment  with the public information (48 per cent from seawater, 42 per cent from groundwater and  10 per cent from surface water). In FY2020, Water Corporation supplied BHP site-specific  proportions of water sources for our Kwinana operations for the FY2017 to FY2020 period  and will continue to do so. \nThe image is a bar chart showing withdrawals by quality from fiscal year 2017 to fiscal year 2021. The bars are divided into three types:\n\n- **Type 3** is represented in orange and is the largest portion of each bar.\n- **Type 2** is represented in yellow.\n- **Type 1** is represented in gray.\n\nEach bar corresponds to a year and displays the amount withdrawn in megajoules (MJ). The overall trend shows an increase in withdrawals over this period, with 2021 having the highest total.\nThe image is a bar chart titled \"FY2021 Withdrawals by asset (by source).\" It displays the amount of water withdrawn, measured in megaliters, from various sources by different assets for the fiscal year 2021. The sources of water are color-coded as follows: seawater (orange), groundwater (light orange), surface water (dark gray), and third-party water (light gray).\n\nThe assets listed along the horizontal axis are:\n\n1. Escondida\n2. Petroleum\n3. WAIO\n4. BMA\n5. Nickel West\n6. Olympic Dam\n7. Pampa Norte\n8. New South Wales Energy Coal\n9. BMC\n10. Legacy assets\n11. Jansen Potash Project\n\nThe vertical axis represents the volume of water withdrawn, with values ranging from 0 to 250,000 megaliters. From the chart, it is evident that:\n\n- Escondida has the highest withdrawal, relying mainly on seawater.\n- Petroleum and WAIO have significant withdrawals, primarily from groundwater.\n- Other assets have smaller withdrawals from a mix of water sources. The Jansen Potash Project and a few other assets show minimal or no withdrawals.\nWater withdrawals for FY2021 across our operations increased by 15  per cent from FY2020 (from 380,330 ML to 438,660 ML) due primarily  to increased withdrawal of seawater at Escondida and our Petroleum  operated assets. The large increase (33,500 ML) in Petroleum seawater  withdrawals results from a decision to include the water withdrawals  resulting from our well and seismic operations from FY2021. BHP deemed  it has operational control while well and seismic activities are undertaken  by us. Minor increases at other assets (e.g. Olympic Dam and WAIO) were  offset by a minor decrease in withdrawal at our BMA and BMC operated  assets and at our Nickel West operations. Despite the 15 per cent increase  in water withdrawal, our withdrawal of high-quality water (Type 1 and  Type 2) increased by less than 5 per cent from 87,280 ML in FY2020  to 91,280 ML in FY2021. Total water withdrawals from operated assets  located in high or very high water-stressed areas (as determined by WWF  water risk filter) was 233,190 ML.  \nThe majority of our water withdrawals (65 per cent) come from seawater.  Escondida stopped drawing groundwater from the Monturaqui  borefield in the second half of FY2020. Currently, the majority of  Escondida’s operational water consumption is met by desalinated  water.  The proportion of withdrawals relating to groundwater across  BHP reduced from 33 per cent of withdrawals in FY2020 to 23 per cent  of withdrawals in FY2021, in part due to the reporting of third-party  withdrawals as a distinct category. WAIO, BMA and BMC account for more  than half of terrestrial water withdrawal across our business. \n(4) \t Small quantities of groundwater are extracted for pit dewatering to allow safe mining. "}

Evaporation occurs during a number of\noperational activities including dust suppression, storage of tailings\nand storage of water.\n\nEvaporation consumption is inherently linked with climatic conditions\nduring the reporting period. Evaporation data is estimated or simulated\nusing average climatic conditions and therefore consumption due to\nevaporation should remain relatively stable. Due to the link with climatic\nconditions, the volumes consumed via evaporation are predominately\noutside of BHP’s direct control.\n\nEntrained water includes water incorporated into product and/\n\nor waste streams, such as tailings, that cannot be easily recovered.\nEntrainment may show variability due to the type and location of ore\nduring any given reporting period. The use of water in our processing\nfacilities, or for reducing dust release during storage of product, can\nresult in entrainment of water.\n\nThe category of ‘other’ for consumption includes several uses, the\nmost significant being water used by people for drinking or ablutions\nat operated assets.\n\nThe collation and disclosure of consumption will assist in identifying\nareas for improvements in data accuracy for entrainment and\nevaporation, and assist with identifying opportunities to reduce,\nwhere possible, loss of water.\n\nTotal consumption in FY2021 was 267,130 ML and 106,950 ML in high\nor very high water-stressed locations respectively. The operated assets\nin FY2021 that consumed the most water were Escondida, WAIO\n\nand BMA. Entrainment of water in tailings is the largest contributor to\nconsumption at Escondida, whereas evaporation is the key driver of\nconsumption at WAIO. Entrainment in ore during processing, as well as\nevaporation from dust suppression and tailings and water storage all\ncontribute to consumption at BMA. It should be noted that in any given\nreporting period, consumption and discharge volumes might be higher\nthan withdrawals as evaporation can occur from water that has been\ncaptured and stored during previous periods.\n\n288 | BHP | AnnualReport 2021\n\nFY2021 Consumption by asset\n\nMegalitres\n100,000\n80,000\n60,000\n40,000\n20,000\n; Biase\nm -\n8 5 2 & & 8 F% 2 ese e\nSo * @€ 3 2 8% & & 88 s\na = 2 B&B &g 2 85\nfa e 5 & Of RB gf 3\na S a BS fot g\n3. «5 Fa B gS\n8\n\n© Evaporation @ Entrainment @ Other\n\nChanges in water storage\n\nBHP has a commitment to contribute to improved mining sector water\nreporting through strengthened ICMM guidance, aligned with GRI\nrequirements.

Evaporation occurs during a number of  operational activities including dust suppression, storage of tailings  and storage of water. \nEvaporation consumption is inherently linked with climatic conditions  during the reporting period. Evaporation data is estimated or simulated  using average climatic conditions and therefore consumption due to  evaporation should remain relatively stable. Due to the link with climatic  conditions, the volumes consumed via evaporation are predominately  outside of BHP’s direct control.  \nEntrained water includes water incorporated into product and/ or waste streams, such as tailings, that cannot be easily recovered.  Entrainment may show variability due to the type and location of ore  during any given reporting period. The use of water in our processing  facilities, or for reducing dust release during storage of product, can  result in entrainment of water.  \nThe category of ‘other’ for consumption includes several uses, the  most significant being water used by people for drinking or ablutions  at operated assets.  \nThe collation and disclosure of consumption will assist in identifying  areas for improvements in data accuracy for entrainment and  evaporation, and assist with identifying opportunities to reduce,  where possible, loss of water. \nThe image is a bar chart titled \"FY2021 Consumption by asset\" with measurements in megalitres. The chart displays consumption data for various assets, categorized into three types: Evaporation (orange), Entrainment (light orange), and Other (grey). \n\nHere's a summary of the asset consumption:\n\n- **Escondida**: Highest consumption, predominantly evaporation.\n- **WAIO and BMA**: Moderate consumption, primarily evaporation.\n- **Nickel West and Olympic Dam**: Lower consumption; includes entrainment and other uses.\n- **Pampa Norte, New South Wales Energy Coal, BMC, Legacy assets, Jansen Potash Project, Petroleum**: Minimal consumption with small variations in types. \n\nThe chart highlights significant differences in water consumption across these assets.\nChanges in water storage \nBHP has a commitment to contribute to improved mining sector water  reporting through strengthened ICMM guidance, aligned with GRI  requirements. In FY2021 we collated information on change in water  storage as described in the revised ICMM Water Reporting Guidance  and used it to support further assessment of the validity of assumptions  underpinning asset water models and water balances. Water modelling  contains a degree of uncertainty due to inclusion of estimates and  assumptions. The collation of information to inform reporting of change  in water storage has identified areas for improvement in the estimated  and simulated data within the water models as currently used at our coal  assets. We intend to undertake work during FY2022 to assess underlying  assumptions in an effort to improve the water modelling at our coal  assets, as well as further maturing the measurement of changes in water  storage across the Group. For this reason, we have not included change  in water storage data in our reporting for FY2021. \nWater-related legal performance  \nDuring FY2021 we had three incidents of water-related non-compliance  that resulted in a formal enforcement action. These all occurred in our  Minerals Australia assets with two at BMA and one at BMC. None of  these were associated with non-compliance with discharge limits  set by regulatory permits. \nTotal consumption in FY2021 was 267,130 ML and 106,950 ML in high  or very high water-stressed locations respectively. The operated assets  in FY2021 that consumed the most water were Escondida, WAIO  and BMA. Entrainment of water in tailings is the largest contributor to  consumption at Escondida, whereas evaporation is the key driver of  consumption at WAIO. Entrainment in ore during processing, as well as  evaporation from dust suppression and tailings and water storage all  contribute to consumption at BMA. It should be noted that in any given  reporting period, consumption and discharge volumes might be higher  than withdrawals as evaporation can occur from water that has been  captured and stored during previous periods.

Water-\nrelated risks are managed in line with the BHP risk process. For more information, refer to section 1.9.\n\nTechnology\n\nLeverage technology solutions that drive a step-\n\nchange reduction in water-related risks, realise\nopportunities and deliver multiple benefits.\n\nWater treatment technologies that were shortlisted in FY2020 commenced bench-scale trials and\ntechno-economic assessments at our Olympic Dam operations in FY2021\n\nValue\n\nEffectively value water in investment\nand operated asset decisions through\nintegration into strategy, planning and\nevaluation frameworks.\n\nWater Stewardship is identified as a social value priority at all our operated assets. In FY2021, we\nundertook a review of available evaluation tools and mapped these against the current water\nevaluation process undertaken in BHP. We are currently scoping the next phase of work which will\ninclude a broader review of where water valuation sits within BHP’s decision-making processes and\nwill support the integration of future valuation methods.\n\nDisclosure\n\nTransparently disclose water-related risks,\nmanagement and performance at an\noperated asset level.\n\nIn FY2021, we completed a case study with the ICMM to help inform improvements and increase\nconsistency of water disclosures in the mining sector and to inform an update of the ICMM water\nreporting guidance.\n\nIn FY2021, we assessed alignment of our water sensitivity and water related risk disclosures with\ncurrent widely used frameworks, (which have matured in the last two to three years). We decided to\nalign our disclosure of basin risk with the WWF Water Risk Filter and have updated our disclosures\naccordingly. This allows for more direct comparison with other organisations.\n\nCollective action\n\nCollaborate with stakeholders to improve\nregional water policy and catchment\ngovernance and address shared water\nchallenges within our communities and\nacross our value chain.\n\nCollective action activities in FY2021 included:\n\n- completed a thought leadership paper with Pollination consultants to use the lessons from\nclimate change (such as the importance to unify around a common goal, and agreement on\nthe science) to bring about change in Water Stewardship\n\n- continued to fund and contribute to the development of the Water Resilience Accounting\nFramework (designed to provide a common way to describe water stresses in a catchment)\nby the CEO Water Mandate and other technical civil society partners. We believe this is a key\nfoundation for effective multi-stakeholder conversations on water\n\n- started a study with the University of Notre Dame on the inherent rights of people to access\nwater and preserve its cultural values\n\nBHP co-funds with Rio Tinto the groundwater modelling decision support initiative (GMDS)).\n\nThe GMDSI is managed by the Groundwater Research and Training (NCGRT) at Flinders University,\nSouth Australia, on our behalf and it promotes and supports the improved use of models in\ngroundwater management, regulation and decision-making.\n\nWe continued a program of Water Resource Situational Analyses (WRSA) in FY2021 to inform\n\nour post-FY2022 operated asset context-based water targets (CBWT). Each WRSA will identify\n\nthe shared water challenges in the region through stakeholder consultation and review of public\ninformation by a trusted third party (for example, a university). Once finalised, the WRSA reports\nwill be publicly available to support continued collaboration between stakeholders. The CBWTs\nwill address one or more of the shared challenges in the region, through BHP’s own internal action\ntargets (completed by BHP alone) in conjunction with the collective action targets (completed\nwith one or more external partners). We will publish the approach to setting CBWTs in FY2022.\nWe will share it at public forums, and presented it at World Water Week in August 2021. Through this\npublic disclosure, we aim to build validity for the approach, support others to set effective targets\nand ultimately help improve management of shared water resources. This work is in line with our\ncommitments in our Water Stewardship Position Statement” to develop CBWT, be transparent,\ncollaborative and share knowledge and innovation.\n\n(©) https://waterriskfilterpanda.org/\n\n(7)_https://www.bhp.com/-/media/documents/environment/2020/water-stewardship-position-statement-2020-p2.pdf7la-en\n\nBHP | Annual Report 2021 289\n", "vlm_text": "The table outlines a Water Stewardship Strategy with several key components and corresponding actions taken in FY2021.

The timing of many of the legal\nproceedings and investigations continue to be delayed or uncertain as a\nresult of court closures or delays in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nLegal proceedings relating to the failure of the Fundao\ntailings dam at the Samarco iron ore operations in\nMinas Gerais and Espirito Santo (Samarco dam failure)\n\nThe Group is engaged in numerous legal proceedings relating to the\nSamarco dam failure. While there has been progress in priority areas,\n\nsuch as individual compensation and indemnification for the damage\ncaused by the dam failure, it is not possible at this time to provide a range\n\nof possible outcomes for all proceedings or a reliable estimate of potential\nfuture exposures. There are numerous additional lawsuits against Samarco\nrelating to the dam failure to which the Group is not party. Currently, there\nare approximately 50 ongoing public civil claims and 20 that are suspended.\nThe most significant of these proceedings are summarised below.\n\nR$20 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal\nGovernment of Brazil, states of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais and\nother authorities (R$20 billion Public Civil Claim)\n\nOn 30 November 2015, the Federal Government of Brazil, states of Espirito\nSanto and Minas Gerais and other public authorities collectively filed a public\ncivil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against Samarco\nand its shareholders, BHP Billiton Brasil Ltda. (BHP Brasil) and Vale, seeking\nthe establishment of a fund of up to R$20 billion (approximately US$4 billion)\nin aggregate for clean-up costs and damages.\n\nOn 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, together with Vale and Samarco, entered into\na Framework Agreement with the states of Espirito Santo and Minas Gerais\nand other public authorities to establish a foundation (Fundagao Renova)\nto develop and execute environmental and socioeconomic programs\n(Programs) to remediate and provide compensation for damage caused\nby the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThe term of the Framework Agreement is 15 years, renewable for periods of\none year successively until all obligations under the Framework Agreement\nhave been performed. Under the Framework Agreement, Samarco is\nresponsible, as a primary obligor, for funding Fundagao Renova’s annual\ncalendar year budget for the duration of the Framework Agreement.\n\nThe amount of funding for each calendar year will be dependent on the\nremediation and compensation projects to be undertaken in a particular\nyear. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its funding obligations\nunder the Framework Agreement, each of Vale and BHP Brasil has funding\nobligations under the Framework Agreement, as secondary obligors, in\nproportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.\n\nR$155 billion public civil claim commenced by the Federal Public\nProsecutors’ Office (R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors’\n\nOffice claim)\n\nOn 3 May 2016, the Brazilian Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office filed a public\ncivil claim before the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte against BHP\nBrasil, Vale and Samarco - as well as 18 other public entities (which has since\nbeen reduced to five defendants” by the 12th Federal Court) - seeking\nR$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation\nand collective moral damages in relation to the Samarco dam failure.\n\nThis public civil claim and the R$20 billion Public Civil Claim are broad claims\nthat encompass the majority of the public civil claims filed against BHP Brasil,\nSamarco and Vale. For this reason, the 12th Federal Court has suspended\nother public civil claims while negotiations continue in relation to the\nsettlement of the R$155 billion Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim.\n\nDespite suspension of this public civil claim being for a period of two years\nfrom the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement (described\nbelow) on 8 August 2018 the claim has not been resumed. On 19 March\n\nAdditional\nInformation\n\n2021, the parties to the case agreed to extend the suspension of this\ncase until 27 April 2021. Although the stay period has formally elapsed,\nneither party has made any filings to date, and the parties are engaged\nin negotiations to seek a definitive settlement (summarised below).\n\nGovernance Agreement\n\nOn 25 June 2018, BHP Brasil, Vale, Samarco, the other parties to the\nFramework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors’ Office? and the Public\nDefense Office entered into a Governance Agreement, which settled the\nR$20 billion Public Civil Claim and established a process to renegotiate\nthe Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion\nFederal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim.\n\nUnder the Governance Agreement, renegotiation of the Programs will be\nbased on certain agreed principles, including full reparation consistent\nwith Brazilian law, the requirement for a technical basis for any proposed\nchanges, consideration of findings from experts appointed by BHP Brasil,\nSamarco and Vale, consideration of findings from experts appointed by\nprosecutors and consideration of feedback from impacted communities\n\nSince early CY2021, the parties have been engaging in negotiations, to\nseek a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam\nfailure. The mediation is ongoing as at the date of this Report. It is not\npossible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential\nsettlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may\nbe materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam\nfailure provision. Until revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundagao\nRenova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the\nterms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.\n\nEnforcement Proceedings\n\nSince 7 January 2020, the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte has issued\nseveral decisions creating 13 enforcement proceedings (Enforcement\nProceedings) linked to the R$20 billion Public Civil Claim and R$155 billion\nFederal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim described above. The 13\nEnforcement Proceedings seek to expedite the remediation process\nrelated to the Samarco dam failure. No substantive new claims were\nmade under these proceedings.\n\nIssues covered by these Enforcement Proceedings include environmental\nrecovery, human health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of affected\ncommunities, infrastructure and development, registration of certain\nimpacted individuals under the Programs and indemnities for people\nimpacted by the dam failure, resumption of economic activities, water\nsupply for human consumption and hiring of technical advisers to\nimpacted people, and restructuring Fundagao Renova’s management\nsystem, among other key delivery areas.\n\nIn the context of these Enforcement Proceedings, BHP Brasil, Samarco\nand Vale are seeking determinations, including the repealing of\n\nfishing bans ordered by the courts or administration entities, set-off of\ncompensation paid against future damages that may need to be paid,\nand determination regarding the hiring and supervision of technical\nassistants to impacted people.\n\nSamarco’s judicial reorganisation\n\nOn 9 April 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the\nSecond Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais\nUR Court). The JR proceeding seeks to enable Samarco to negotiate and\nimplement an orderly restructuring of its financial indebtedness in order\nto establish a sustainable financial position for Samarco, among other\nthings, to continue to rebuild its operations and meet its Fundagao Renova\nobligations. Samarco filed for JR following multiple enforcement actions\nfiled by Samarco's creditors that threatened its operations. The JR Court\ngranted Samarco’s JR petition on 12 April 2021 and granted a stay of the\nenforcement actions.\n\nOn 10 June 2021, Samarco submitted its first proposed Plan of\nReorganisation (Plan) to the JR Court. Certain of Samarco's creditors have\nsubmitted formal objections to the Plan. It is expected that a general\nmeeting of creditors will be convened for creditors to vote on whether\n\nto approve, reject or modify the Plan.\n\nAccording to the list of creditors filed with the JR Court by the Judicial\nAdministrators (who are in charge of a first review of the list of creditors\n\n() Currently, solely BHP Brasil, Vale and Samarco, the Federal Government and the state of Minas Gerais are defendants.\n(2) The Public Prosecutors’ Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Espirito Santo public prosecutors’ offices\n(3) The Public Defense Office includes the Federal, State of Minas Gerais and State of Espirito Santo public defense offices.\n\nBHP | Annual Report 2021 291\n", "vlm_text": "4.9   Legal proceedings \nThe Group is involved from time to time in legal proceedings and  governmental investigations of a character normally incidental to our  business, including claims and pending actions against it seeking damages,  or clarification or prosecution of legal rights and regulatory inquiries  regarding business practices.

Although the stay period has formally elapsed,  neither party has made any filings to date, and the parties are engaged  in negotiations to seek a definitive settlement (summarised below). \n\nGovernance Agreement \nOn 25 June 2018, BHP Brasil, Vale, Samarco, the other parties to the  Framework Agreement, the Public Prosecutors’ Office (2)  and the Public  Defense Office (3)  entered into a Governance Agreement, which settled the   ${\\tt R}\\Phi{\\tt20}$   billion Public Civil Claim and established a process to renegotiate  the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R\\$155 billion  Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim.  \nUnder the Governance Agreement, renegotiation of the Programs will be  based on certain agreed principles, including full reparation consistent  with Brazilian law, the requirement for a technical basis for any proposed  changes, consideration of findings from experts appointed by BHP Brasil,  Samarco and Vale, consideration of findings from experts appointed by  prosecutors and consideration of feedback from impacted communities.  \nSince early CY2021, the parties have been engaging in negotiations, to  seek a definitive and substantive settlement of claims relating to the dam  failure. The mediation is ongoing as at the date of this Report. It is not  possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential  settlement outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may  be materially higher than amounts currently reflected in the Samarco dam  failure provision. Until revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundação  Renova will continue to implement the Programs in accordance with the  terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement. \nEnforcement Proceedings \nSince 7 January 2020, the 12th Federal Court of Belo Horizonte has issued  several decisions creating 13 enforcement proceedings (Enforcement  Proceedings) linked to the R\\$20 billion Public Civil Claim and R\\$155 billion  Federal Public Prosecutors’ Office claim described above. The 13  Enforcement Proceedings seek to expedite the remediation process  related to the Samarco dam failure. No substantive new claims were  made under these proceedings.  \nIssues covered by these Enforcement Proceedings include environmental  recovery, human health risk and ecological risk, resettlement of affected  communities, infrastructure and development, registration of certain  impacted individuals under the Programs and indemnities for people  impacted by the dam failure, resumption of economic activities, water  supply for human consumption and hiring of technical advisers to  impacted people, and restructuring Fundação Renova’s management  system, among other key delivery areas. \nIn the context of these Enforcement Proceedings, BHP Brasil, Samarco  and Vale are seeking determinations, including the repealing of  fishing bans ordered by the courts or administration entities, set-off of  compensation paid against future damages that may need to be paid,  and determination regarding the hiring and supervision of technical  assistants to impacted people. \nSamarco’s judicial reorganisation  \nOn 9 April 2021, Samarco filed for judicial reorganisation (JR) with the  Second Business State Court for the Belo Horizonte District of Minas Gerais  (JR Court). The JR proceeding seeks to enable Samarco to negotiate and  implement an orderly restructuring of its financial indebtedness in order  to establish a sustainable financial position for Samarco, among other  things, to continue to rebuild its operations and meet its Fundação Renova  obligations. Samarco filed for JR following multiple enforcement actions  filed by Samarco’s creditors that threatened its operations. The JR Court  granted Samarco’s JR petition on 12 April 2021 and granted a stay of the  enforcement actions. \nOn 10 June 2021, Samarco submitted its first proposed Plan of  Reorganisation (Plan) to the JR Court. Certain of Samarco’s creditors have  submitted formal objections to the Plan. It is expected that a general  meeting of creditors will be convened for creditors to vote on whether  to approve, reject or modify the Plan. \nAccording to the list of creditors filed with the JR Court by the Judicial  Administrators (who are in charge of a first review of the list of creditors  filed by Samarco), Fundação Renova’s funding obligations undertaken by  Samarco are not subject to the JR, although some financial creditors of  Samarco have objected to this position. It is expected that such creditors  will challenge the list of creditors filed by the Judicial Administrators, in order  to, among other things, prevent Samarco from funding Fundação Renova.  It is also expected that such creditors will litigate against Samarco and its  shareholders over the course of the JR proceeding, particularly with respect  to the treatment of Samarco’s Fundação Renova obligations. Such lenders  have objected to the financing that BHP Brasil and Vale have offered to  Samarco on a super-priority basis, known as debtor-in-possession funding.  "}

A date for this  appeal has not yet been set. \n4.10.1   History and development \nBHP Group Limited (formerly BHP Billiton Limited, then BHP Limited  and, before that, The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited) was  incorporated in 1885 and is registered in Australia with ABN 49 004 028  077. BHP Group Plc (formerly BHP Billiton Plc, and before that Billiton Plc)  was incorporated in 1996 and is registered in England and Wales with  registration number 3196209. Successive predecessor entities to BHP  Group Plc have operated since 1860.  \nWe have operated under a Dual Listed Company (DLC) structure since  29 June 2001. Under the DLC structure, the two parent companies,  BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, operate as a single economic  entity, run by a unified Board and senior executive management team.  For more information on the DLC structure, refer to section 4.10.3. \n4.10.2   Markets \nAs at the date of this Annual Report, BHP Group Limited has a primary  listing on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) (ticker BHP) in Australia  and BHP Group Plc has a premium listing on the UK FCA’s Official List and  its ordinary shares are admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange  (LSE) (ticker BHP). BHP Group Plc also has a secondary listing on the  Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) (ticker BHP) in South Africa.  \nIn addition, BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc are listed on the  New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in the United States. Trading on the  NYSE is via American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) evidencing American  Depositary Shares (ADSs), with each ADS representing two ordinary  shares of BHP Group Limited or BHP Group Plc. Citibank N.A. (Citibank) is  the Depositary for both ADS programs. BHP Group Limited’s ADSs have  been listed for trading on the NYSE (ticker BHP) since 28 May 1987 and  BHP Group Plc’s since 25 June 2003 (ticker BBL). \n4.10.3   Organisational structure General \nBHP consists of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc, operating as  a single unified economic entity, following the completion of the DLC  merger in June 2001 (the DLC merger). For a full list of BHP Group Limited  and BHP Group Plc subsidiaries, refer to note 13 ‘Related undertakings  of the Group’ in section 3.2. \nOn 17 August 2021, BHP announced its intention to unify its current DLC  structure. For further details of the unification proposal, see section 1.5. \nDLC structure \nBHP shareholders approved the DLC merger in 2001, which was designed  to place ordinary shareholders of both companies in a position where  they have economic and voting interests in a single group. \nThe principles of the BHP DLC structure are reflected in the DLC Structure  Sharing Agreement and include the following: \n\n \n–\t The two companies must operate as if they are a single unified  economic entity, through Boards of Directors that comprise the same  individuals and a unified senior executive management team.\n\n –\t The Directors of both companies will, in addition to their duties to  the company concerned, have regard to the interests of the ordinary  shareholders in the two companies as if the two companies were a  single unified economic entity and, for that purpose, the Directors of  each company take into account in the exercise of their powers the  interests of the shareholders of the other.\n\n –\t Certain DLC equalisation principles must be observed. These are  designed to ensure that for so long as the Equalisation Ratio between  a BHP Group Limited ordinary share and a BHP Group Plc ordinary  share is 1:1, the economic and voting interests resulting from holding  one BHP Group Limited ordinary share and one BHP Group Plc ordinary  share are, so far as practicable, equivalent. For more information, refer  to sub-section ‘Equalisation of economic and voting rights’ below. "}

Where the Board  authorises a conflict of interest, the Board may prohibit the relevant Director  from voting on any matter relating to the conflict. The Board has adopted  procedures to manage these voting restrictions. \nLoans by Directors \nAny Director may lend money to BHP at interest with or without security or  may, for a commission or profit, guarantee the repayment of any money  borrowed by BHP and underwrite or guarantee the subscription of shares  or securities of BHP or of any corporation in which BHP may be interested  without being disqualified as a Director and without being liable to  account to BHP for any commission or profit. \nAppointment and retirement of Directors \nAppointment of Directors \nThe Constitution and Articles of Association provide that a person may be  appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors of BHP or may be  elected by the shareholders in a general meeting.  \nAny person appointed as a Director of BHP by the existing Directors will  hold office only until the next general meeting that includes an election  of Directors.  A person may be nominated by shareholders as a Director of BHP if:\n\n –\t a shareholder provides a valid written notice of the nomination\n\n –\t the person nominated by the shareholder satisfies candidature for the  office and consents in writing to his or her nomination as a Director \nin each case, at least 40 business days before the earlier of the date of the  general meeting of BHP Group Plc and the corresponding general meeting  of BHP Group Limited. The person nominated as a Director may be elected  to the Board by ordinary resolution passed in a general meeting. \nUnder the Articles of Association, if a person is validly nominated for election  as a Director at a general meeting of BHP Group Limited, the Directors of BHP  Group Plc must nominate that person as a Director at the corresponding  general meeting of BHP Group Plc. An equivalent requirement is included in  the Constitution, which requires any person validly nominated for election as a  Director of BHP Group Plc to be nominated as a Director of BHP Group Limited.

Generally, we own the product we extract and we are required\nto pay royalties or other taxes to the government.\n\nThe rights to explore for minerals, oil and natural gas are granted to us by the\ngovernment that owns the natural resources we wish to explore. Usually, the\nright to explore carries with it the obligation to spend a defined amount of\nmoney on the exploration, or to undertake particular exploration activities.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions where we have assets, such as Trinidad and Tobago,\na production sharing contract (PSC) governs the relationship between\n\nthe government and companies concerning how much of the oil and\n\ngas extracted from the country each party will receive.

The company bears the financial\nrisk of the initiative and explores, develops and ultimately produces the field\nas required. When successful, the company is permitted to use the money\nfrom a certain set percentage of produced oil and gas to recover its capital\nand operational expenditures, known as ‘cost oil’.
