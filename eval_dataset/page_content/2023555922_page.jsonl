In some instances, incentives and provisions related  to foreign investment, both foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic offshore investment,  are identified. Several of the surveyed jurisdictions also have special incentives and tax rules  related to free trade zones (FTZs).  \nA.  Foreign Direct Investment  \nThere are differing conditions related to foreign direct investment and offshore investment  identified in several of the jurisdictions surveyed. In  Israel ,  Iran ,  Russia ,  Taiwan ,  China ,  Turkey ,  Brazil ,  Canada , and  Egypt , there are provisions identified discussing this kind of investment,  including incentives in certain circumstances. In jurisdictions such as  Israel , there are no  restrictions on foreign investment unless it is deemed a national security interest. In  Russia , there  is a list of unfriendly jurisdictions. In  Taiwan  and  Brazil , there are no rules per se, but transactions  must be registered with the central authority or bank. In  China , there are strict controls on  outbound investing.  \nB.  Tax Treaties  \nThe primary tax treaties identified in the surveys deal with double taxation and tax evasion.  Mutual investment treaties are also identified in several jurisdictions.  \nC.  Free Trade Zones  \nFTZs are special economic zones that feature different tax and trade regulations from the rest of  the jurisdiction. They go by different names depending on the jurisdiction. In this survey,  Brazil ,  Egypt ,  Israel ,  Iran ,  Kenya ,  South Korea ,  Mexico ,  Portugal ,  Russia ,  Taiwan ,  France , and  China   had at least one FTZ identified. In jurisdictions like  Iran  and  Mexico , there are exemptions for  $0\\%$    VAT. Some jurisdictions, like  Portugal  (Madeira) and  Israel  (Eilat, on the Red Sea), have one  specific FTZ. Other jurisdictions, like  Russia  and  Brazil , have many identified FTZs. Each of the  FTZs identified in the surveys contains somewhat unique provisions, further explained in the  individual report components.  "}

According to the Administrative Regulations on Foreign Exchange, any domestic  organization or individual that seeks to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the  issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate  registrations in accordance with the provisions of the State Council foreign exchange  administrative department, i.e., the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.   \nB.  Guiding Opinions on Direction of Outbound Investment  \nIn 2017, the central government regulators issued opinions on guiding and regulating the  “direction of outbound investment.” The opinions categorize foreign investment into three  groups of “encourage,” “limited,” and “prohibited,” respectively.    \nEncouraged investment set forth in the opinions include  "}

For  instance, in January 2017, the Al Youm 7 newspaper issued a report, entitled “Egypt Loses One  Billion Dollars Annually Because of the Free Economic Zones.” The report claims that, instead of  locating their corporate headquarters in Cairo, investors create corporations in the economic  zones to evade paying tax. According to the report, in fiscal year 2015-2016, the Egyptian  Investment Authority received fees from economic zone investors equal to   $\\mathrm{US}\\S119$   million.  However, the estimated tax loss due to the tax incentives and credit system offered to  establishments operating in the economic zones was   $\\mathrm{US}\\S432$   million.

Instead of finding capital gains provisions  within the Income Tax Act, the Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxation (Special Measures  Act) applies to capital gains income arising from the transfer of securities.   \nCapital gains from sales of certain securities (including shares and equity interest in corporations  and warrant bonds) are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of   $20.315\\%$  :   $15\\%$   under the Special Measures   $\\operatorname{Act}{}^{6}\\,0.315\\%$   under the Reconstruction Special Measures   $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{t}^{7}$    and   $5\\%$   under the Local Tax Act.   8  Capital gains from listed shares and unlisted shares are  separately calculated. Listed shares are shares listed on the Japanese or foreign stock exchanges  and government bonds, among others. Unlisted shares are shares other than listed shares. Capital  gains or losses arising from the sale of listed shares cannot be used to offset capital losses or gains  arising from the sale of unlisted shares.   \nGains from foreign stock transfers are taxed in the same way as gains from domestic stock  transfers. In many cases, gains on the sale of foreign stocks are not taxed in foreign countries  under tax treaties.  Japan has tax treaties with 81 countries.  If there is no tax treaty with a  specific country, the foreign tax credit applies to sales of foreign stocks. When a resident pays  foreign income taxes, the amount of those foreign income taxes is allowed as a credit against  Japan’s income taxes for the year.   \nCapital gains from sales of real property are also separately taxed from general capital gains  income under the Special Measures Act, but different rules apply.  Gains on property that has  been held for over five years as of January 1 of the year when the transfer is made are considered  long-term capital gains.  The tax rate is the same as the one that applies to capital gains income  from securities transfers:   $20.315\\%$  .  Gains on property that is held for five years or less as of  January 1 of the year when the transfer is made are classified as short-term capital gains and are  taxed at a rate of  $39.63\\%$  :   $30\\%$   under the Special Measures Act,    $0.63\\%$   under the Reconstruction  Special Measures   $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{t}_{}^{17}$   and   $9\\%$   under the Local Tax Act.  The Special Measures Act provides  special deductions that apply in specified cases. For example, if an individual’s real estate is  forcibly expropriated, the person may deduct 50 million yen (approx. US\\$345,850) from capital  gains for the expropriation.   "}

If a company in the Russian IT industry earns at least   $70\\%$   of its total revenue from specific IT  activities, it can enjoy a corporate income tax rate of  $0\\%$  , and a social security contribution rate of   $7.6\\%$  . Companies can qualify for these benefits if they provide services using their own computer  programs and databases, which are included in the unified register of Russian computer  programs and databases.   \nV.  Regional and Local Incentives  \nA.  Corporate Profit Tax Deductions  \nThe investment tax deduction from corporate profit tax is applicable only to taxpayers located in  regions that have adopted the relevant laws. The current corporate tax is set at   $20\\%$  , with   $17\\%$    transferred to the federal budget and  $3\\%$   paid to the regional budget. Each region is allowed to  establish its own reduced rate for the part of the corporate profit tax that goes to the regional  budget. The maximum amount of the deduction is determined based on the amount of expenses  specified in the Tax Code.   "}

Tax Treaty with the United States  \nTurkey entered into an income tax treaty with the United States (US) in 1996.  The treaty applies,  on the Turkish side, to the income tax, corporate tax, and levies imposed on the income and  corporate taxes, and on the US side, to federal income taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue  Code (but excluding the accumulated earnings tax, the personal holding company tax, and social  security taxes), and the excise taxes imposed with respect to private foundations.   \nThe treaty provides maximum rates for certain types of income, protections from double taxation,  anti-abuse rules, rules regarding exchange of information with regard to fiscal evasion, and rules  limiting benefits to persons engaged in treaty shopping.  The treaty sets a maximum rate of  $20\\%$    for the taxation of dividends at the source country, with an exception that the maximum rate will  be   $10\\%$   if the dividends are paid to a corporation that owns at least   $10\\%$   of the payor.   Furthermore, the treaty provides that the general maximum rate is  $15\\%$   for taxation of interest in  the source country, with the exception of loans made by financial institutions, which will be taxed  at a maximum rate of   $10\\%$  .  The Letter of Submittal includes the following note regarding the  taxation of capital gains under the treaty:  \nThe taxation of capital gains under the Agreement is essentially the same as under most  recent U.S. tax treaties. In general, except for real property and business property, the  country of the seller’s residence is given the exclusive right to tax capital gains. A limited  exception to this general rule relates to the alienation of corporate shares. Under the  exemption, one Contracting State may, in accordance with its law, tax a resident of the  other State on the gain from the alienation of shares issued by a corporation that is a  resident of the first Contracting State if (i) the shares are not quoted on a stock exchange in  the first Contracting State; (ii) the shares are alienated to a resident of that State; and (iii)  the seller held the securities for one year or less. (Current U.S. law does not impose tax on  a foreign person on the disposal of shares in a U.S. corporation.)  "}

Real Estate Like-Kind Exchanges  \nThere is an important tax distinction between real property and other forms of investments: an  ability to trade it for a similar property via a tax-free like-kind exchange.   \nLike-kind exchanges, which are exchanges of real property used for business or held as an  investment solely for other business or investment property that is the same type or “like-kind,”  have long been permitted under the Internal Revenue Code.  Generally, if a taxpayer makes a  like-kind exchange, they are not required to recognize a gain or loss. If, as part of the exchange,  the taxpayer also receives other (not like-kind) property or money, they must recognize a gain  from the other property and money received. The taxpayer cannot recognize a loss incurred from  a like-kind exchange.  "}
