To overcome challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge base through semantic similarity calcu- lation. By referencing external knowledge, RAG effectively reduces the problem of generating factually incorrect content. Its integration into LLMs has resulted in widespread adoption, establishing RAG as a key technology in advancing chatbots and enhancing the suitability of LLMs for real-world applica- tions. \nRAG technology has rapidly developed in recent years, and the technology tree summarizing related research is shown in Figure 1. The development trajectory of RAG in the era of large models exhibits several distinct stage characteristics.

RAG research shifted towards providing better information for LLMs to answer more com- plex and knowledge-intensive tasks during the inference stage, leading to rapid development in RAG studies. As research progressed, the enhancement of RAG was no longer limited to the inference stage but began to incorporate more with LLM fine-tuning techniques. \n\nThe burgeoning field of RAG has experienced swift growth, yet it has not been accompanied by a systematic synthesis that could clarify its broader trajectory. This survey endeavors to fill this gap by mapping out the RAG process and charting its evolution and anticipated future paths, with a focus on the integration of RAG within LLMs. This paper considers both technical paradigms and research methods, summarizing three main research paradigms from over 100 RAG studies, and analyzing key technologies in the core stages of “Retrieval,” “Generation,” and “Augmentation.” On the other hand, current research tends to focus more on methods, lacking analysis and sum mari z ation of how to evaluate RAG.

Choosing the appropriate retrieval granularity during inference can be a simple and effective strategy to improve the retrieval and downstream task performance of dense retrievers. "}

Among them, DenseX [30]proposed the concept of\nusing propositions as retrieval units. Propositions are defined\nas atomic expressions in the text, each encapsulating a unique\nfactual segment and presented in a concise, self-contained nat-\nural language format. This approach aims to enhance retrieval\nprecision and relevance. On the Knowledge Graph (KG),\nretrieval granularity includes Entity, Triplet, and sub-Graph.\nThe granularity of retrieval can also be adapted to downstream\ntasks, such as retrieving Item IDs [40]in recommendation tasks\nand Sentence pairs [38]. Detailed information is illustrated in\nTable I.\n\nB. Indexing Optimization\n\nIn the Indexing phase, documents will be processed, seg-\nmented, and transformed into Embeddings to be stored in a\nvector database. The quality of index construction determines\nwhether the correct context can be obtained in the retrieval\nphase.\n\n1) Chunking Strategy: The most common method is to split\nthe document into chunks on a fixed number of tokens (e.g.,\n100, 256, 512) [88]. Larger chunks can capture more context,\nbut they also generate more noise, requiring longer processing\ntime and higher costs. While smaller chunks may not fully\nconvey the necessary context, they do have less noise. How-\never, chunks leads to truncation within sentences, prompting\nthe optimization of a recursive splits and sliding window meth-\nods, enabling layered retrieval by merging globally related\ninformation across multiple retrieval processes [89]. Never-\ntheless, these approaches still cannot strike a balance between\nsemantic completeness and context length. Therefore, methods\nlike Small2Big have been proposed, where sentences (small)\nare used as the retrieval unit, and the preceding and following\nsentences are provided as (big) context to LLMs [90].\n\n2) Metadata Attachments: Chunks can be enriched with\nmetadata information such as page number, file name, au-\nthor,category timestamp. Subsequently, retrieval can be filtered\nbased on this metadata, limiting the scope of the retrieval.\nAssigning different weights to document timestamps during\nretrieval can achieve time-aware RAG, ensuring the freshness\nof knowledge and avoiding outdated information.\n\nIn addition to extracting metadata from the original doc-\numents, metadata can also be artificially constructed. For\nexample, adding summaries of paragraph, as well as intro-\nducing hypothetical questions. This method is also known as\nReverse HyDE. Specifically, using LLM to generate questions\nthat can be answered by the document, then calculating the\nsimilarity between the original question and the hypothetical\nquestion during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between\nthe question and the answer.\n\n3) Structural Index: One effective method for enhancing\ninformation retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for\nthe documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can\nexpedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data.\n\nHierarchical index structure. File are arranged in parent-\nchild relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum-\nmaries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal\nof data and assisting the RAG system in determining which\nchunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion\ncaused by block extraction issues.\n\nKnowledge Graph index. Utilize KG in constructing the\nhierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining\nconsistency. It delineates the connections between different\nconcepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for\nillusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the\ninformation retrieval process into instructions that LLM can\ncomprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge\nretrieval and enabling LLM to generate contextually coherent\nresponses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG\nsystem. To capture the logical relationship between document\ncontent and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building\nan index between multiple documents using KG. This KG\nconsists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the\ndocuments, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating\nsemantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships\nwithin the document structure), effectively addressing knowl-\nedge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document\nenvironment.\n\nC. Query Optimization\n\nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its\ndirect reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for\nretrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult,\nand imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness.\nSometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language\nis not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language\ncomplexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when\ndealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi-\nations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not\ndiscern whether “LLM” refers to large language model or a\nMaster of Laws in a legal context.\n\n1) Query Expansion: Expanding a single query into mul-\ntiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing\nfurther context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby\nensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers.\n\nMulti-Query. By employing prompt engineering to expand\nqueries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in\nparallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather\nmeticulously designed.\n\nSub-Query. The process of sub-question planning represents\nthe generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextualize\nand fully answer the original question when combined. This\nprocess of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar\nto query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be\ndecomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the\nleast-to-most prompting method [92].\n\nChain-of-Verification(CoVe). The expanded queries undergo\nvalidation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci-\nnations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher\nreliability [93].\n", "vlm_text": "\nIn text, retrieval granularity ranges from fine to coarse, including Token, Phrase, Sentence, Proposition, Chunks, Doc- ument.

Specifically, using LLM to generate questions that can be answered by the document, then calculating the similarity between the original question and the hypothetical question during retrieval to reduce the semantic gap between the question and the answer. \n3) Structural Index:  One effective method for enhancing information retrieval is to establish a hierarchical structure for the documents. By constructing In structure, RAG system can expedite the retrieval and processing of pertinent data. \nHierarchical index structure . File are arranged in parent- child relationships, with chunks linked to them. Data sum- maries are stored at each node, aiding in the swift traversal of data and assisting the RAG system in determining which chunks to extract. This approach can also mitigate the illusion caused by block extraction issues. \nKnowledge Graph index . Utilize KG in constructing the hierarchical structure of documents contributes to maintaining consistency. It delineates the connections between different concepts and entities, markedly reducing the potential for illusions. Another advantage is the transformation of the information retrieval process into instructions that LLM can comprehend, thereby enhancing the accuracy of knowledge retrieval and enabling LLM to generate con textually coherent responses, thus improving the overall efficiency of the RAG system. To capture the logical relationship between document content and structure, KGP [91] proposed a method of building an index between multiple documents using KG. This KG consists of nodes (representing paragraphs or structures in the documents, such as pages and tables) and edges (indicating semantic/lexical similarity between paragraphs or relationships within the document structure), effectively addressing knowl- edge retrieval and reasoning problems in a multi-document environment. \nC. Query Optimization \nOne of the primary challenges with Naive RAG is its direct reliance on the user’s original query as the basis for retrieval. Formulating a precise and clear question is difficult, and imprudent queries result in subpar retrieval effectiveness. Sometimes, the question itself is complex, and the language is not well-organized. Another difficulty lies in language complexity ambiguity. Language models often struggle when dealing with specialized vocabulary or ambiguous abbrevi- ations with multiple meanings. For instance, they may not discern whether “LLM” refers to  large language model  or a Master of Laws  in a legal context. \n1) Query Expansion:  Expanding a single query into mul- tiple queries enriches the content of the query, providing further context to address any lack of specific nuances, thereby ensuring the optimal relevance of the generated answers. \nMulti-Query . By employing prompt engineering to expand queries via LLMs, these queries can then be executed in parallel. The expansion of queries is not random, but rather meticulously designed. \nSub-Query . The process of sub-question planning represents the generation of the necessary sub-questions to contextual ize and fully answer the original question when combined. This process of adding relevant context is, in principle, similar to query expansion. Specifically, a complex question can be decomposed into a series of simpler sub-questions using the least-to-most prompting method [92]. \nChain-of-Verification  $(C o V e)$  . The expanded queries undergo validation by LLM to achieve the effect of reducing halluci- nations. Validated expanded queries typically exhibit higher reliability [93]. "}

The model harnesses the content\nrequired to address the input task as a contextual basis for\nretrieving pertinent knowledge, which in turn facilitates the\ngeneration of improved responses in subsequent iterations.\n\nB. Recursive Retrieval\n\nRecursive retrieval is often used in information retrieval and\nNLP to improve the depth and relevance of search results.\nThe process involves iteratively refining search queries based\non the results obtained from previous searches. Recursive\nRetrieval aims to enhance the search experience by gradu-\nally converging on the most pertinent information through a\nfeedback loop. IRCoT [61] uses chain-of-thought to guide\nthe retrieval process and refines the CoT with the obtained\nretrieval results. ToC [57] creates a clarification tree that\nsystematically optimizes the ambiguous parts in the Query. It\ncan be particularly useful in complex search scenarios where\nthe user’s needs are not entirely clear from the outset or where\nthe information sought is highly specialized or nuanced. The\nrecursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning\nand adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in\nimproved satisfaction with the search outcomes.\n\nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and\nmulti-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive\n\nretrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve\ndata in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing\nsections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a\nretrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary\nretrieval within the document refines the search, embodying\nthe recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop\nretrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data\nsources, extracting interconnected information [106].\n\nC. Adaptive Retrieval\n\nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and\nSelf-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs\nto actively determine the optimal moments and content for\nretrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the\ninformation sourced.\n\nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein\nLLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen\nin model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph-\nToolformer [107]-[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di-\nvides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs\nproactively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em-\nploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive\nstance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary\ninformation, akin to how an agent utilizes tools.\n\nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame-\nwork to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a\nsearch engine during text generation. It navigates this process\nusing special tokens that facilitate actions such as search\nengine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby\nexpanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external\nsearch engines.

The recursive nature of the process allows for continuous learning and adaptation to the user’s requirements, often resulting in improved satisfaction with the search outcomes. \nTo address specific data scenarios, recursive retrieval and multi-hop retrieval techniques are utilized together. Recursive retrieval involves a structured index to process and retrieve data in a hierarchical manner, which may include summarizing sections of a document or lengthy PDF before performing a retrieval based on this summary. Subsequently, a secondary retrieval within the document refines the search, embodying the recursive nature of the process. In contrast, multi-hop retrieval is designed to delve deeper into graph-structured data sources, extracting interconnected information [106]. \n\nC. Adaptive Retrieval \nAdaptive retrieval methods, exemplified by Flare [24] and Self-RAG [25], refine the RAG framework by enabling LLMs to actively determine the optimal moments and content for retrieval, thus enhancing the efficiency and relevance of the information sourced. \nThese methods are part of a broader trend wherein LLMs employ active judgment in their operations, as seen in model agents like AutoGPT, Toolformer, and Graph- Toolformer [107]–[109]. Graph-Toolformer, for instance, di- vides its retrieval process into distinct steps where LLMs pro actively use retrievers, apply Self-Ask techniques, and em- ploy few-shot prompts to initiate search queries. This proactive stance allows LLMs to decide when to search for necessary information, akin to how an agent utilizes tools. \nWebGPT [110] integrates a reinforcement learning frame- work to train the GPT-3 model in autonomously using a search engine during text generation. It navigates this process using special tokens that facilitate actions such as search engine queries, browsing results, and citing references, thereby expanding GPT-3’s capabilities through the use of external search engines. Flare automates timing retrieval by monitoring the confidence of the generation process, as indicated by the probability of generated terms [24]. When the probability falls below a certain threshold would activates the retrieval system to collect relevant information, thus optimizing the retrieval cycle. Self-RAG [25] introduces “reflection tokens” that allow the model to introspect its outputs. These tokens come in two varieties: “retrieve” and “critic”. The model autonomously decides when to activate retrieval, or alternatively, a predefined threshold may trigger the process. During retrieval, the gen- erator conducts a fragment-level beam search across multiple paragraphs to derive the most coherent sequence. Critic scores are used to update the subdivision scores, with the flexibility to adjust these weights during inference, tailoring the model’s behavior. Self-RAG’s design obviates the need for additional class if i ers or reliance on Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, thus streamlining the decision-making process for when to engage retrieval mechanisms and improving the model’s autonomous judgment capabilities in generating ac- curate responses.

T ASK AND  E VALUATION \nThe rapid advancement and growing adoption of RAG in the field of NLP have propelled the evaluation of RAG models to the forefront of research in the LLMs community. The primary objective of this evaluation is to comprehend and optimize the performance of RAG models across diverse application scenarios.This chapter will mainly introduce the main downstream tasks of RAG, datasets, and how to evaluate RAG systems. \nA. Downstream Task \nThe core task of RAG remains Question Answering (QA), including traditional single-hop/multi-hop QA, multiple- choice, domain-specific QA as well as long-form scenarios suitable for RAG. In addition to QA, RAG is continuously being expanded into multiple downstream tasks, such as Infor- mation Extraction (IE), dialogue generation, code search, etc. The main downstream tasks of RAG and their corresponding datasets are summarized in Table II. \nB. Evaluation Target \nHistorically, RAG models assessments have centered on their execution in specific downstream tasks. These evaluations employ established metrics suitable to the tasks at hand. For instance, question answering evaluations might rely on EM and F1 scores [7], [45], [59], [72], whereas fact-checking tasks often hinge on Accuracy as the primary metric [4], [14], [42]. BLEU and ROUGE metrics are also commonly used to evaluate answer quality [26], [32], [52], [78]. Tools like RALLE, designed for the automatic evaluation of RAG applications, similarly base their assessments on these task- specific metrics [160]. Despite this, there is a notable paucity of research dedicated to evaluating the distinct characteristics of RAG models.The main evaluation objectives include: \nRetrieval Quality . Evaluating the retrieval quality is crucial for determining the effectiveness of the context sourced by the retriever component. Standard metrics from the domains of search engines, recommendation systems, and information retrieval systems are employed to measure the performance of the RAG retrieval module. Metrics such as Hit Rate, MRR, and NDCG are commonly utilized for this purpose [161], [162]. \n\nGeneration Quality .

This evaluation can be categorized based on the content’s objectives: unlabeled and labeled content. For unlabeled content, the evaluation encompasses the faithfulness, relevance, and non-harmfulness of the generated answers. In contrast, for labeled content, the focus is on the accuracy of the information produced by the model [161]. Additionally, both retrieval and generation quality assessments can be conducted through manual or automatic evaluation methods [29], [161], [163]. \nC. Evaluation Aspects \nContemporary evaluation practices of RAG models empha- size three primary quality scores and four essential abilities, which collectively inform the evaluation of the two principal targets of the RAG model: retrieval and generation. \n1) Quality Scores:  Quality scores include context rele- vance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. These qual- ity scores evaluate the efficiency of the RAG model from different perspectives in the process of information retrieval and generation [164]–[166]. \nContext Relevance  evaluates the precision and specificity of the retrieved context, ensuring relevance and minimizing processing costs associated with extraneous content. \nAnswer Faithfulness  ensures that the generated answers remain true to the retrieved context, maintaining consistency and avoiding contradictions. \nAnswer Relevance  requires that the generated answers are directly pertinent to the posed questions, effectively addressing the core inquiry. \n2) Required Abilities:  RAG evaluation also encompasses four abilities indicative of its adaptability and efficiency: noise robustness, negative rejection, information integration, and counter factual robustness [167], [168]. These abilities are critical for the model’s performance under various challenges and complex scenarios, impacting the quality scores. \nNoise Robustness  appraises the model’s capability to man- age noise documents that are question-related but lack sub- stantive information. \nNegative Rejection  assesses the model’s discernment in refraining from responding when the retrieved documents do not contain the necessary knowledge to answer a question. \nInformation Integration  evaluates the model’s proficiency in synthesizing information from multiple documents to address complex questions. \nCounter factual Robustness  tests the model’s ability to rec- ognize and disregard known inaccuracies within documents, even when instructed about potential misinformation. \nContext relevance and noise robustness are important for evaluating the quality of retrieval, while answer faithfulness, answer relevance, negative rejection, information integration, and counter factual robustness are important for evaluating the quality of generation.

Presently, LLMs can\neffortlessly manage contexts exceeding 200,000 tokens °. This\ncapability signifies that long-document question answering,\npreviously reliant on RAG, can now incorporate the entire\ndocument directly into the prompt. This has also sparked\ndiscussions on whether RAG is still necessary when LLMs\n\nShttps://www.trulens.org/trulens_eval/core_concepts_rag_triad/\n°https://kimi.moonshot.cn\n\nare not constrained by context. In fact, RAG still plays an\nirreplaceable role. On one hand, providing LLMs with a\nlarge amount of context at once will significantly impact its\ninference speed, while chunked retrieval and on-demand input\ncan significantly improve operational efficiency. On the other\nhand, RAG-based generation can quickly locate the original\nreferences for LLMs to help users verify the generated an-\nswers. The entire retrieval and reasoning process is observable,\nwhile generation solely relying on long context remains a\nblack box. Conversely, the expansion of context provides new\nopportunities for the development of RAG, enabling it to\naddress more complex problems and integrative or summary\nquestions that require reading a large amount of material to\nanswer [49]. Developing new RAG methods in the context of\nsuper-long contexts is one of the future research trends.\n\nB.

Another trend is to introduce SLMs with specific functionalities into RAG and fine-tuned by the results of RAG system. For example, CRAG [67] trains a lightweight retrieval evaluator to assess the overall quality of the retrieved docu- ments for a query and triggers different knowledge retrieval actions based on confidence levels. \nD. Scaling laws of RAG \nEnd-to-end RAG models and pre-trained models based on RAG are still one of the focuses of current re- searchers [173].The parameters of these models are one of the key factors.While scaling laws [174] are established for LLMs, their applicability to RAG remains uncertain. Initial studies like RETRO  $^{++}$   [44] have begun to address this, yet the parameter count in RAG models still lags behind that of LLMs. The possibility of an Inverse Scaling Law   10 , where smaller models outperform larger ones, is particularly intriguing and merits further investigation. \nE. Production-Ready RAG \nRAG’s practicality and alignment with engineering require- ments have facilitated its adoption. However, enhancing re- trieval efficiency, improving document recall in large knowl- edge bases, and ensuring data security—such as preventing inadvertent disclosure of document sources or metadata by LLMs—are critical engineering challenges that remain to be addressed [175]. \n\nThe development of the RAG ecosystem is greatly impacted by the progression of its technical stack. Key tools like LangChain and LLamaIndex have quickly gained popularity with the emergence of ChatGPT, providing extensive RAG- related APIs and becoming essential in the realm of LLMs.The emerging technology stack, while not as rich in features as LangChain and LLamaIndex, stands out through its specialized products. For example, Flowise AI prioritizes a low-code approach, allowing users to deploy AI applications, including RAG, through a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface. Other technologies like HayStack, Meltano, and Cohere Coral are also gaining attention for their unique contributions to the field. \nIn addition to AI-focused vendors, traditional software and cloud service providers are expanding their offerings to include RAG-centric services. Weaviate’s Verba   11   is designed for personal assistant applications, while Amazon’s Kendra 12 offers intelligent enterprise search services, enabling users to browse various content repositories using built-in connectors. In the development of RAG technology, there is a clear trend towards different specialization directions, such as: 1) Customization - tailoring RAG to meet specific requirements. 2) Simplification - making RAG easier to use to reduce the "}

Multi-modal RAG \nRAG has transcended its initial text-based question- answering confines, embracing a diverse array of modal data. This expansion has spawned innovative multimodal models that integrate RAG concepts across various domains: \nImage . RA-CM3 [176] stands as a pioneering multimodal model of both retrieving and generating text and images. BLIP-2 [177] leverages frozen image encoders alongside LLMs for efficient visual language pre-training, enabling zero- shot image-to-text conversions. The “Visualize Before You Write” method [178] employs image generation to steer the LM’s text generation, showing promise in open-ended text generation tasks. \nAudio and Video . The GSS method retrieves and stitches together audio clips to convert machine-translated data into speech-translated data [179]. UEOP marks a significant ad- vancement in end-to-end automatic speech recognition by incorporating external, offline strategies for voice-to-text con- version [180]. Additionally, KNN-based attention fusion lever- ages audio embeddings and semantically related text embed- dings to refine ASR, thereby accelerating domain adaptation. \nVid2Seq augments language models with specialized temporal markers, facilitating the prediction of event boundaries and textual descriptions within a unified output sequence [181]. \nCode . RBPS [182] excels in small-scale learning tasks by retrieving code examples that align with developers’ objectives through encoding and frequency analysis. This approach has demonstrated efficacy in tasks such as test assertion genera- tion and program repair. For structured knowledge, the CoK method [106] first extracts facts pertinent to the input query from a knowledge graph, then integrates these facts as hints within the input, enhancing performance in knowledge graph question-answering tasks. \nVIII. C ONCLUSION \nThe summary of this paper, as depicted in Figure 6, empha- sizes RAG’s significant advancement in enhancing the capa- bilities of LLMs by integrating parameterized knowledge from language models with extensive non-parameterized data from external knowledge bases. The survey showcases the evolution of RAG technologies and their application on many different tasks. The analysis outlines three developmental paradigms within the RAG framework: Naive, Advanced, and Modu- lar RAG, each representing a progressive enhancement over its predecessors. RAG’s technical integration with other AI methodologies, such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, has further expanded its capabilities. Despite the progress in RAG technology, there are research opportunities to improve its robustness and its ability to handle extended contexts.
