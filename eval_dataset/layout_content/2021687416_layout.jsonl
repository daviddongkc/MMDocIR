In 31 out of the 36 jurisdictions surveyed,  laws were found that afford journalists protection (to varied extent) from compelled disclosure  of their sources.

The class of protected persons (and the scope of  protection) partly depends on the meaning of the term “news” as it appears in article 12. The term  “news” is not defined in the text of the law. However, within the context of the constitutional  right to freedom of the press, the Court of Cassation has described the role of the news as  “presenting to the public opinion the thoughts and actions of those running public affairs … and  notifying the public of information and ideas related to political developments and other areas of  public interest that are relevant to public debate.” 13   The fact that the protection was granted in  the Press Law, which applies to all publications, and not the Press Labor Law, where “journalist”  as a professional status is defined, supports the conclusion that the protected class of  “authors”includes those outside of the Press Labor Law’s definition for “journalist,” thus  including freelance writers or individual bloggers engaged in the communication of “news.” 14   The Court of Cassation has not had occasion to address this issue, however.
