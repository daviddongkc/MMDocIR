Here's the content:\n\n| Pin No. | Signal Name   | Pin No. | Signal Name   |\n|---------|---------------|---------|---------------|\n| 1       | HDMI_DET      | 2       | NC            |\n| 3       | HDMI_D2P      | 4       | GND           |\n| 5       | HDMI_D2M      | 6       | HDMI_D1P      |\n| 7       | GND           | 8       | HDMI_D1M      |\n| 9       | HDMI_D0P      | 10      | GND           |\n| 11      | HDMI_D0M      | 12      | HDMI_CLKP     |\n| 13      | GND           | 14      | HDMI_CLKM     |\n| 15      | HDMI_CEC_OUT  | 16      | GND           |\n| 17      | DDC_CLOCK     | 18      | DDC_DATA      |\nThis image shows a diagram of an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) connector. HDMI connectors are commonly used for transmitting digital video and audio signals between devices such as televisions, computers, and gaming consoles. The numbers indicate the pin positions on the connector.\nPin assignment and signal name of USB  \nThe table shows pin configurations for a device. It lists:\n\n- Pin 1: +5V\n- Pin 2: Data-\n- Pin 3: Data+\n- Pin 4: GND (Ground)\nThe image depicts a rectangular shape with a series of yellow rectangles or blocks aligned in a row along its center. There are labels with lines pointing to the yellow rectangles, numbered \"4\" on the left and \"1\" on the right. The design resembles a simplified circuit diagram or schematic representation.\nPin assignment and signal name of Power  \nThe table lists the pin numbers and their corresponding signal names:\n\n- **Pin No. 1**: Signal Name is +5V\n- **Pin No. 2**: Signal Name is GND\nThe image shows a diagram with two concentric circles. The smaller circle is labeled \"1\" and the larger circle is labeled \"2.\""}
