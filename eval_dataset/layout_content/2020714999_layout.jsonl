{"layout": 313, "type": "text", "text": "This is essentially a two-stage exercise. First, there is the threshold enquiry aimed at  determining whether or not the enactment in question constitutes a limitation on one or  other guaranteed right. This entails examining (a) the content and scope of the relevant  protected right(s) and (b) the meaning and effect of the impugned enactment to see  whether there is any limitation of (a) by (b). Subsections (1) and (2) of section 39 of the  Constitution [the interpretation of Bill of rights clause] give guidance as to the  interpretation of both the rights and the enactment, essentially requiring them to be  interpreted so as to promote the value system of an open and democratic society based on  human dignity, equality and freedom. If upon such analysis no limitation is found, that is  the end of the matter. The constitutional challenge is dismissed there and then… If there is  indeed a limitation, however, the second stage ensues. This is ordinarily called the  limitations exercise. In essence this requires a weighing-up of the nature and importance  of the right(s) that are limited together with the extent of the limitation as against the  importance and purpose of the limiting enactment. Section 36(1) of the Constitution spells  out these factors that have to be put into the scales in making a proportional evaluation of  all the counterpoised rights and interests involved.
