To receive several batches of names matching the same\ncriteria, choose a standing order.\n\nSingle Orders\n\nThe single order is the simplest option. If you choose an immediate start date, you'll be provided with an actual count\nof students who meet your criteria. This count shows the correct number after the search results have been\ndeduplicated against your processed orders. However, the count does not include deduplication against prior orders\nthat have been built or submitted, but not processed.\n\nWith a single order, you're likely to miss students who meet your criteria but test later than your start date. You can\nview an estimated count of those students by changing your start date or changing your order type to a standing\norder.\n\nStanding Orders\n\nWith a standing order, the system does the work for you. You'll receive an initial list of student names plus new\nnames meeting the same criteria throughout the time period you specify. You set the start date, the maximum\nnumber of names, the end date and the frequency with which you'd like to receive additional names.\n\nIf you choose an immediate start date, you'll see two counts: an actual count of student names available right away\n(deduplicated against prior, processed orders) and an estimate of names available in the future.\n\nYou won't know with certainty the total number of student names you'll receive. And once your order has been\nprocessed, it will continue to run automatically — you won’t be able to adjust your criteria.\n\nStart Date Options\nWhether you choose a single order or a standing order, you have three options for starting your order.\n\nImmediate Start Date\nIf, judging by the name count, College Board Search already has the student names you need, choose an immediate\nstart date and submit your order.\n\nImmediate Start Date with Delayed Submission\n\nChoosing an immediate start date but waiting to submit your order can help you manage your time and your\nresources. Create the order when you have the time to strategize and to craft an effective search, but wait to submit\nit if the name count is low or if you expect new names meeting your criteria to be loaded in the future.\n\nWhen you're ready to submit your order, you can check the final deduplicated name count and adjust criteria as\nneeded.\n\nFuture Start Date\n\nTo submit the order now but delay processing, choose a custom date or a date when new data becomes available.\nFor instance, you might want to place an SAT order in October but delay it until the December SAT data is loaded in\nJanuary. Your order will be among the first processed when new data is loaded.\n\nIf you choose a future start date, you'll see two counts: the actual number of names available immediately and an\nestimate of the total volume.

For instance, if your goal is to increase diversity, the ethnicity criterion in demographics\nwill be a strategy driver.

You’ll be taken to the Search for Students home page. Start the name-licensing process by clicking the orange  Start new search  button. You’ll be taken to the Select Criteria section. \nIf you’ve saved searches recently, you can access them from the Search for Students home page in the left column. You can also access searches you’ve defined as top searches. \nBuild Your List \nTo build a list of names from the College Board Search database, select the criteria that best describe the students you’re looking for. Start by choosing the graduating classes you’re interested in; you must choose at least one class (or include all) before moving on to other criteria. If you subscribe to Enrollment Planning Service as well as Student Search Service, you’ll see two options here:  Research & license  and  Research only . Be sure to choose  Research & license  if your goal is to license names. \nOnce you’ve selected graduating classes, the number of available students will display in the right column.  As you continue to define your student list, that number will change to reflect the volume of students who meet your criteria. \nOther criteria describing students include geography, College Board exams, demographics, academic performance and extracurricular participation, intended major, address preferences and college preferences. \nYou can select criteria in any order — and you don’t have to select criteria from every category. Get more tips in Power Searching . \nVisualize Your List \nFind out if the list you’re building meets your needs by clicking  View Dashboard  at any point and using the three data visualization tabs: Overview, Map and Custom Charts. The Overview displays charts and tables profiling the population you’ve defined, while the Map displays their geographic distribution. Use Custom Charts to create pie charts, bar charts and cross-tab charts representing self-selected characteristics of the students in your list.
