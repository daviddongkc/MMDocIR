While the 2019 Report reflects that beneficial ownership  transparency remains a vulnerability in many jurisdictions, the report also highlights significant  steps taken by various jurisdictions on the issue.  Cyprus issued circulars to banking, credit,  payment, and virtual money institutions advising them to be extra vigilant against shell  companies and to avoid doing business with them.  To increase the transparency of company  ownership, Peru enacted legislation to mandate the disclosure of beneficial ownership.  Cyprus  and Serbia have new laws addressing centralized records of beneficial owners.  Additionally, in  an effort to increase transparency, increasing numbers of jurisdictions, such as Argentina and  Curacao, are concluding tax information sharing agreements.  Others, such as Pakistan, Panama,  and Russia are beginning to share financial information under the OECD’s Multilateral  Competent Authority Agreement.   Here in the United States, on May 11, 2018, a new Treasury  Department rule on beneficial ownership went into effect, requiring covered entities to identify  and verify the identities of beneficial owners of legal entities.
