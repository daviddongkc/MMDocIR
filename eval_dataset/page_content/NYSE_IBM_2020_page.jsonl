This trend will continue until the  75 percent of workloads that were left behind  migrate to hybrid cloud.  \nIBM is doubling down on its investment in hybrid  cloud and AI because we see it as the best way to  help our customers on this journey. They want the  speed, efﬁ  ciency and innovation that comes with  moving to the cloud, without having to reinvent  their entire IT infrastructure. That’s what hybrid  cloud is all about. \nThe image is an abstract, geometric illustration featuring several translucent, layered squares stacked on top of each other. Emerging from the top layer are cylindrical, pillar-like shapes extending upward. The color scheme is primarily blue, giving it a modern, digital or data-related appearance.\n“Over the last decade, IBM has  transformed itself to meet the  mission-critical needs of our  clients. Today, IBM is laser-  focused on open hybrid cloud— a \\$1 trillion market opportunity.

Hybrid cloud alone represents a $1 trillion market.\n\nWe are targeting this market because we recognize the value it brings to our clients. Through deep engagement with a wide breadth of\nclients, we know that a hybrid cloud approach on average creates 2.5 times more value for enterprises than a public cloud-alone\nstrategy, and IBM leads in delivering better return on investment (ROI) through hybrid cloud. This higher ROI comes from enhanced\nbusiness acceleration, developer productivity, infrastructure cost efficiency and regulatory compliance and security.\n\nWe have built a hybrid cloud platform, based on open technologies, that allows clients to realize their digital and AI transformations\nacross the applications, data and environments in which they operate. Watson is IBM’s industry leading AI for business, a portfolio of\nenterprise-ready pre-built applications and tools designed to reduce the costs and hurdles of AI adoption through industry-leading\nnatural language processing, automation and trust in our responsible use of AI. Building on our hybrid cloud platform, our software\ncollects and analyzes data from across our clients’ enterprises, training our AI to provide insights into their business processes.

Employees are supported with 24/7  access to IBM’s world-class Health and Safety team, education, timely updates and forums to ask questions and raise concerns.   \nAdditionally, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IBM has focused on mental health and supporting our employees for the long  run with programs shaped by frequent survey polls and employee input sessions. Such programs include: four weeks additional paid  time off for working parents and caregivers facing disruption, robust case management through our Employee Assistance Program to  manage COVID-19 exposures and develop comprehensive guidance, training for employees on resilience and for managers on how to  identify and address mental health issues and financial counseling offerings tailored to pandemic-related matters.

We had strong contract renewals and added a number of new clients in the fourth quarter.  \nInfrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of   $\\pmb{\\mathbb{S}}\\pmb{19,669}$   million decreased 5.1 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency)  compared to the prior year. Revenue was impacted by lower client-based business volumes year to year in the more economically  sensitive industries. Clients took a longer-term view, with a focus on modernizing their core infrastructure to create operational  efficiency and move their mission-critical workloads to a hybrid cloud platform. These clients turn to GTS’s managed infrastructure  services with its deep expertise in managing clients’ mission-critical infrastructures and next generation service delivery capabilities  infused with AI and automation. As we prepare to separate our managed infrastructure services business in 2021, we are deeply  engaged with our clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo, the world’s leading provider of infrastructure services.  \nTechnology Support Services (TSS) revenue of  $^{\\S6,\\underline{{\\Sigma}}44}$  million decreased 7.3 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) in  2020, driven primarily by the Systems hardware product cycles and a shift away from lower value services.  \nWithin GTS, cloud revenue of  $\\S9.4$   billion grew 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency.

At December 31, 2020, we had over $14 billion of\ncash, restricted cash and cash equivalents. We have focused our Global Financing business on IBM’s hybrid cloud and AI offerings. We\nwound down our OEM Commercial Financing business and entered into an agreement to sell our IBM commercial financing receivables\nbeginning in December 2020. Consistent with our refocused Global Financing strategy and expected capital needs, IBM Credit will no\nlonger require direct access to the public capital markets. As part of IBM’s overall 2021 debt pay down strategy, in the first half of the\nyear IBM Credit will redeem $1.75 billion of outstanding debt and deregister with the SEC.\n\nLooking forward, there is tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients become digital businesses. We continue to take prudent\nactions to improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities. We are managing for the long-term and are confident in\nthe direction and focus of our business. We expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company with an improving\nfinancial profile while maintaining our solid and modestly growing dividend policy.\n\nOur pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2021,\nan increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2020, of which $0.3 billion generally relates to legally required contributions\nto non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2021 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.9\nbillion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2020. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at\nDecember 31, 2020. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately\n$1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2020. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion,\nan increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion\nand $18.2 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining\nan adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted\nlines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31,\n2018 through 2020.\n\nCash Flow and Liqui\n\n($ in billions)\n\n2020 2019 2018\nNet cash from operating activities $18.2 $14.8 $15.2\nCash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities $14.3 $ 9.0 $12.2\nCommitted global credit facilities $15.3 $15.3 $15.3\n\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a\ncombination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within\na couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. Refer to note P,\n“Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.\n\nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the\ncompany to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback\ntransactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain\nconditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less\nthan 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.\n\nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply\nwith debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of\ndefault were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and\npayable.\n\nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event\nof default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing\nderivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were\nto fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was\n$627 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level\nof the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a\nchange in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.\n", "vlm_text": "We have also taken actions to enhance our balance sheet strength and liquidity.

We  wound down our OEM Commercial Financing business and entered into an agreement to sell our IBM commercial financing receivables  beginning in December 2020. Consistent with our refocused Global Financing strategy and expected capital needs, IBM Credit will no  longer require direct access to the public capital markets. As part of IBM’s overall 2021 debt pay down strategy, in the first half of the  year IBM Credit will redeem  $\\S1.75$   billion of outstanding debt and deregister with the SEC.  \nLooking forward, there is tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients become digital businesses. We continue to take prudent  actions to improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities. We are managing for the long-term and are confident in  the direction and focus of our business. We expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company with an improving  financial profile while maintaining our solid and modestly growing dividend policy.  \nOur pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately  $\\S2.3$  billion in 2021,  an increase of approximately   $\\S100$   million compared to 2020, of which   $\\S0.3$   billion generally relates to legally required contributions  to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2021 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately   $\\S2.9$  billion, an increase of approximately   $\\S300$   million compared to 2020. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at  December 31, 2020. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately   $\\S1.5$   billion, approximately flat versus 2020. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately   $\\S1.4$   billion,  an increase of approximately  $\\S300$   million compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets.  \nLiquidity and Capital Resources  \nThe company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between   $\\S14.8$   billion  and  $\\S18.2$   billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining  an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted  lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31,  2018 through 2020.  \nThe table provides financial data for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. It shows the following information:\n\n1. **Net cash from operating activities**:\n   - 2020: $18.2\n   - 2019: $14.8\n   - 2018: $15.2\n\n2. **Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities**:\n   - 2020: $14.3\n   - 2019: $9.0\n   - 2018: $12.2\n\n3. **Committed global credit facilities**:\n   - 2020: $15.3\n   - 2019: $15.3\n   - 2018: $15.3\nOn July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of   $\\S34.8$  billion. The transaction was funded through a  combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within  a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. Refer to note P,  “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.  \nThe indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the  company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback  transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain  conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less  than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least   $\\S500$   million.  \nWe are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply  with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of  default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and  payable.  \nWe do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event  of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing  derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were  to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was   $\\S627$   million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level  of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a  change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.  "}

The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of  the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next  12 months.  \nCertain contractual obligations reported in the previous table exclude the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the  amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future  cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items.  Certain obligations related to our divestitures are included.  \nPurchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the  following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make  specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to  purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is  cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted  minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that  is a firm commitment.  \nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that specify that we will purchase all or a portion of our requirements of a  specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing  or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, we do not consider them  to be purchase obligations.  \nInterest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2020, plus the interest rate  spread associated with that debt, if any.  \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements  \nFrom time to time, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67),  “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.”  \nAt December 31, 2020, we had no such off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current  or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital  expenditures or capital resources. See the table above for our contractual obligations, and note R, “Commitments & Contingencies,”  for detailed information about our guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. We do not have retained  interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments.  \nCritical Accounting Estimates  \nThe application of GAAP requires IBM to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its  reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the  most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or  assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of  outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to IBM’s financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development,  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBM’s Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies  are described in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.”  "}

Senior management has discussed the development,\nselection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBM’s Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies\nare described in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.”\n\nThe inputs into certain of our critical accounting estimates considered the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These\nestimates included, but were not limited to, the allowances for credit losses, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets and\nother long-lived assets, our net investments in sales-type or direct financing leases, valuation allowances for tax assets and revenue\nrecognition. The macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our critical accounting\nestimates reflected in our 2020 results. Given the inherent uncertainty of the magnitude of future impacts from and/or the duration of\nthe pandemic, our estimates may change materially in future periods.\n\nA quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides\nmaterial information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users\nof the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent\nmanagement’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as\nforecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.\n\nPension Assumptions\n\nFor our defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension\n(income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on\nplan assets.\n\nChanges in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic\npension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal\nPension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, decreased by 90 basis points to 2.20 percent on December 31, 2020. This\nchange will increase pre-tax income recognized in 2021 by an estimated $48 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had\nincreased by 90 basis points on December 31, 2020, pre-tax income recognized in 2021 would decrease by an estimated $29 million.\nFurther changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO\nexceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase,\nrespectively, in the PPP’s PBO of an estimated $1.3 billion based upon December 31, 2020 data.\n\nThe expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected\nreturns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of\nplan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The\ndifferences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized over five years\nin the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses,\nwhich are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed\nthresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards.\n\nTo the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets\nassumption, each 50 basis point increase or decrease in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an\nestimated decrease or increase, respectively, of $240 million on the following year’s pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based\nupon the PPP’s plan assets at December 31, 2020 and assuming no contributions are made in 2021).\n\nWe may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to our pension plans. Actual results that differ\nfrom the estimates may result in more or less future IBM funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of\nthese types of changes on our pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective\nplan.\n\nIn addition to the above, we evaluate other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality,\nand update these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from\nactuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.\n\nFor additional information on our pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note V, “Retirement-Related Benefits.”\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nApplication of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically,\ncomplex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the\nappropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance\n", "vlm_text": "\nThe inputs into certain of our critical accounting estimates considered the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A description of the methods used by management to estimate the\namount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Factors that could result in actual receivable\nlosses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the\neconomic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Global Financing’s receivables portfolio.\n\nTo the extent that actual collectibility differs from management’s estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Global Financing’s\nsegment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated\n$26 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates.\n\nResidual Value\n\nResidual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can\nimpact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Global Financing estimates the\nfuture fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and\nobtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are\nperiodically reviewed and “other than temporary” declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification.\nAnticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed.\n\nFactors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market\nbrought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.\n\nTo the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than management’s estimates by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment\npre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2020 would have been lower by an estimated $52\nmillion. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than management’s estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end\nof lease when the equipment is remarketed.\n\nCurrency Rate Fluctuations\n\nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At\nDecember 31, 2020, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more\ndollars than at year-end 2019. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions\nand other foreign currency-based transactions.\n\nDuring periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when\npricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position\ncompetitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our\ncustomers.

These revisions in the  estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.  \nGlobal Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses  \nThe Global Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records  adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the  amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Factors that could result in actual receivable  losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the  economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Global Financing’s receivables portfolio.  \nTo the extent that actual collectibility differs from management’s estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Global Financing’s  segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated   $\\S26$   million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates.  \nResidual Value  \nResidual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can  impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Global Financing estimates the  future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and  obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are  periodically reviewed and “other than temporary” declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification.  Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed.  \nFactors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market  brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.  \nTo the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than management’s estimates by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment  pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2020 would have been lower by an estimated   $\\S52$  million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than management’s estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end  of lease when the equipment is remarketed.  \nCurrency Rate Fluctuations  \nChanges in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At  December 31, 2020, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more  dollars than at year-end 2019. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions  and other foreign currency-based transactions.  \nDuring periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when  pricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position  competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our  customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, we believe that some of the currency-based changes in  "}

We also maintain currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which may\ntemporarily mitigate, but not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results.\n\nWe translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to\n“adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant\ncurrency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could\ntake to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in\n2020. Based on the currency rate movements in 2020, total revenue decreased 4.6 percent as reported and 4.7 percent at constant\ncurrency versus 2019. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net\nimpact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately\n$280 million in 2020 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $290 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The\nsame mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $300 million in 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of\n$260 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial\nresults.

The ongoing impact is not material given the size of the company’s operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2020\nand 2019 revenue, respectively).\n\nMarket Risk\n\nIn the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of\nthe Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in\nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\n\nChange in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in\n2019.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over\nfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public\naccounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations\nof the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits\nto obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due\nto error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nincluded obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included\nperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting  as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in  Internal Control–Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of  the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the  period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in  our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,  2020, based on criteria established in  Internal Control–Integrated Framework  (2013) issued by the COSO.  \nChange in Accounting Principle  \nAs discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in  2019.  \nBasis for Opinions  \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over  financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying  Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s  consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public  accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be  independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations  of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits  to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due  to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of  the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such  procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial  statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as  well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting  included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included  performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis for our opinions.  \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting  \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of  financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only  in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding  prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect  on the financial statements.  \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

Any noncontrolling interest in the equity of a subsidiary is reported as a component of total equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Net income and losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest is reported as described above in the Consolidated Income Statement.  The accounts of variable interest entities (VIEs) are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements, if required. Investments in  business entities in which the company does not have control but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and  financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method and the company’s proportionate share of income or loss is recorded in  other (income) and expense. The accounting policy for other investments in equity securities is described within the “Marketable  Securities” section of this note. Equity investments in non-publicly traded entities lacking controlling financial interest or significant  influence are primarily measured at cost, absent other indicators of fair value, net of impairment, if any. All intercompany transactions  and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.  \nUse of Estimates  \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect  amounts that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. Estimates are made for the  following, among others: revenue, costs to complete service contracts, income taxes, pension assumptions, valuation of assets  including goodwill and intangible assets, loss contingencies, allowance for credit losses and other matters. These estimates are based  on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, including in 2020, the macroeconomic  impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results may be different from these estimates.  \nRevenue  \nThe company accounts for a contract with a client when it has written approval, the contract is committed, the rights of the parties,  including payment terms, are identified, the contract has commercial substance and consideration is probable of collection.  \nRevenue is recognized when, or as, control of a promised product or service transfers to a client, in an amount that reflects the  consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring those products or services. If the consideration  promised in a contract includes a variable amount, the company estimates the amount to which it expects to be entitled using either  the expected value or most likely amount method. The company’s contracts may include terms that could cause variability in the  transaction price, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties, and performance bonuses or other forms  of contingent revenue.

The standalone\nselling price (SSP) is the price at which the company would sell a promised product or service separately to a client. In most cases, the\ncompany is able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances\nto similar clients. The company typically establishes SSP ranges for its products and services which are reassessed on a periodic basis\nor when facts and circumstances change.\n\nIn certain instances, the company may not be able to establish a SSP range based on observable prices and the company estimates\nSSP. The company estimates SSP by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, overall market conditions, including\ngeographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, competitor actions, internal costs, profit objectives and pricing\npractices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, the company may estimate SSP for a product or service by applying the residual\napproach. This approach is most commonly used when certain perpetual software licenses are only sold bundled with one year of PCS\nand a price has not been established for the software. Estimating SSP is a formal process that includes review and approval by the\ncompany’s management.\n\nServices Costs\n\nRecurring operating costs for services contracts are recognized as incurred. For fixed-price design and build contracts, the costs of\nexternal hardware and software accounted for under the cost-to-cost measure of progress are deferred and recognized based on the\nlabor costs incurred to date (i.e., the measure of progress), as a percentage of the total estimated labor costs to fulfill the contract as\ncontrol transfers over time for these performance obligations. Certain eligible, nonrecurring costs (i.e., setup costs) incurred in the\ninitial phases of outsourcing contracts and other cloud-based services contracts, including Software-as-a-Service arrangements, are\ncapitalized when the costs relate directly to the contract, the costs generate or enhance resources of the company that will be used in\nsatisfying the performance obligation in the future, and the costs are expected to be recovered. These costs consist of transition and\nsetup costs related to the installation of systems and processes and other deferred fulfillment costs, including, for example, prepaid\nassets used in services contracts (i.e., prepaid software or prepaid maintenance).

The company performs periodic reviews to assess the recoverability of deferred contract transition and\nsetup costs. If the carrying amount is deemed not recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized. Refer to note C, “Revenue\nRecognition,” for the amount of deferred costs to fulfill a contract at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nIn situations in which an outsourcing contract is terminated, the terms of the contract may require the client to reimburse the company\nfor the recovery of unbilled accounts receivable, unamortized deferred contract costs and additional costs incurred by the company to\ntransition the services.\n\nSoftware Costs\n\nCosts that are related to the conceptual formulation and design of licensed software programs are expensed as incurred to research,\ndevelopment and engineering expense; costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been\nestablished are capitalized as an intangible asset. Capitalized amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging up\nto three years and are recorded in software cost within cost of sales.

The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value  of plan assets and the benefit obligation at December 31, the measurement date. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit  obligation is the projected benefit obligation (PBO), which represents the actuarial present value of benefits expected to be paid upon  retirement based on employee services already rendered and estimated future compensation levels. For the nonpension  postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), which represents the  actuarial present value of postretirement benefits attributed to employee services already rendered. The fair value of plan assets  represents the current market value of assets held in an irrevocable trust fund, held for the sole benefit of participants, which are  invested by the trust fund. Overfunded plans, with the fair value of plan assets exceeding the benefit obligation, are aggregated and  recorded as a prepaid pension asset equal to this excess. Underfunded plans, with the benefit obligation exceeding the fair value of  plan assets, are aggregated and recorded as a retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligation equal to this excess.  \nThe current portion of the retirement and nonpension post-retirement benefit obligations represents the actuarial present value of  benefits payable in the next 12 months exceeding the fair value of plan assets, measured on a plan-by-plan basis. This obligation is  recorded in compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \nNet periodic pension and nonpension postretirement benefit cost/(income) is recorded in the Consolidated Income Statement and  includes service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs/(credits) and (gains)/losses  previously recognized as a component of other comprehensive income/(loss) (OCI) and amortization of the net transition asset  remaining in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI). The service cost component of net benefit cost is recorded in  Cost, SG&A and RD&E in the Consolidated Income Statement (unless eligible for capitalization) based on the employees’ respective  functions. The other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from service cost within other (income) and expense in  the Consolidated Income Statement.  \n(Gains)/losses and prior service costs/(credits) are recognized as a component of OCI in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive  Income as they arise. Those (gains)/losses and prior service costs/(credits) are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic  cost/(income) pursuant to the recognition and amortization provisions of applicable accounting guidance. (Gains)/losses arise as a  result of differences between actual experience and assumptions or as a result of changes in actuarial assumptions. Prior service  costs/(credits) represent the cost of benefit changes attributable to prior service granted in plan amendments.  \nThe measurement of benefit obligations and net periodic cost/(income) is based on estimates and assumptions approved by the  company’s management. These valuations reflect the terms of the plans and use participant-specific information such as  compensation, age and years of service, as well as certain assumptions, including estimates of discount rates, expected return on plan  assets, rate of compensation increases, interest crediting rates and mortality rates.  \nDefined Contribution Plans  \nThe company’s contribution for defined contribution plans is recorded when the employee renders service to the company. The charge  is recorded in Cost, SG&A and RD&E in the Consolidated Income Statement based on the employees’ respective functions.  "}

The company measures stock-\nbased compensation cost at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award and recognizes the cost on a straight-line\nbasis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the employee requisite service period. The company grants its employees Restricted Stock\nUnits (RSUs), including Retention Restricted Stock Units (RRSUs); Performance Share Units (PSUs); and periodically grants stock\noptions. RSUs are stock awards granted to employees that entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically\nover a one- to five-year period. PSUs are stock awards where the number of shares ultimately received by the employee depends on\nthe company’s performance against specified targets and typically vest over a three-year period. Over the performance period, the\nnumber of shares that will be issued is adjusted based upon the probability of achievement of performance targets. The ultimate\nnumber of shares issued and the related compensation cost recognized as expense will be based on a comparison of the final\nperformance metrics to the specified targets.

The\ninterest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transactions where the company is the lessee.

The company’s variable lease payments\ngenerally relate to payments tied to various indexes, non-lease components and payments above a contractual minimum fixed amount.\n\nOperating leases are included in operating right-of-use assets—net, current operating lease liabilities and operating lease liabilities in\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.

A significant portion of the company’s lease\nportfolio is real estate, which are mainly accounted for as operating leases, and are primarily used for corporate offices and data\ncenters. The average term of the real estate leases is approximately five years. The company also has equipment leases, such as IT\nequipment and vehicles, which have lease terms that range from two to five years. For certain of these operating and finance leases,\nthe company applies a portfolio approach to account for the lease assets and lease liabilities.\n\nAccounting for Leases as a Lessor\n\nThe company typically enters into leases as an alternative means of realizing value from equipment that it would otherwise sell. Assets\nunder lease include new and used IBM equipment and certain OEM products. IBM equipment generally consists of IBM Z, Power\nSystems and Storage Systems products.\n\nLease payments due to IBM are typically fixed and paid in equal installments over the lease term. The majority of the company’s leases\ndo not contain variable payments that are dependent on an index or a rate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or\na rate (e.g., property taxes), that are paid directly by the company and are reimbursed by the client, are recorded as revenue, along\nwith the related cost, in the period in which collection of these payments is probable. Payments that are made directly by the client to\na third party, including certain property taxes and insurance, are not considered part of variable payments and therefore are not\nrecorded by the company. The company has made a policy election to exclude from consideration in contracts all collections from sales\nand other similar taxes.\n\nThe company’s payment terms for leases are typically unconditional. Therefore, in an instance when the client requests to terminate\nthe lease prior to the end of the lease term, the client would typically be required to pay the remaining lease payments in full. At the\nend of the lease term, the company allows the client to either return the equipment, purchase the equipment at the then-current fair\nmarket value or at a pre-stated purchase price or renew the lease based on mutually agreed upon terms.\n\nWhen lease arrangements include multiple performance obligations, the company allocates the consideration in the contract between\nthe lease components and the non-lease components on a relative standalone selling price basis.\n\nSales-Type and Direct Financing Leases\nFor a sales-type or direct financing lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from inventory and a net investment in the\nlease is recorded.

SEGMENTS  \nIn the first quarter of 2020, the company realigned offerings and the related management system to reflect divestitures completed in  the second half of 2019 and tighter integration of certain industry-related consulting services. Accordingly, the company updated its  Cloud & Cognitive Software segment, Global Business Services segment and the Other–divested businesses category in the first quarter  of 2020 and recast the related historical information for consistency with the go-forward performance. Total recast revenue for full- year 2019 and 2018 was approximately   $\\S0.3$   billion and   $\\S0.4$   billion, respectively. There was no change to the Global Technology  Services, Systems or Global Financing segments, and there was no impact to IBM’s consolidated results.  "}

Here's a summary of the contents:\n\n1. **Cash Equivalents**:\n   - **Time deposits and certificates of deposit**: Level 2 assets. $7,668 million in 2020; $4,392 million in 2019.\n   - **Money market funds**: Level 1 assets. $148 million in 2020; $427 million in 2019.\n   - **U.S. government securities**: Level 2 assets. $500 million in 2020; none in 2019.\n   - **Total cash equivalents**: $8,316 million in 2020; $4,819 million in 2019.\n\n2. **Equity Investments**:\n   - Level 1 assets. $2 million in 2020; $0 in 2019.\n\n3. **Debt Securities**:\n   - **Current debt securities**: Level 2 assets. $600 million in 2020; $696 million in 2019.\n   - **Noncurrent debt securities**: Level 2 assets. $7 million in 2020; $65 million in 2019.\n\n4. **Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments**:\n   - **Interest rate contracts**: Level 2. Assets $100 million in 2020, $56 million in 2019. Liabilities were not applicable in both years.\n   - **Foreign exchange contracts**: Level 2. Assets $111 million in 2020; $175 million in 2019. Liabilities $580 million in 2020; $635 million in 2019.\n\n5. **Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments**:\n   - **Foreign exchange contracts**: Level 2 assets. $13 million in 2020; $10 million in 2019. Liabilities $47 million in 2020; $33 million in 2019.\n   - **Equity contracts**: Level 1, 2 assets. $12 million in 2020; $1 million in 2019. Liabilities $12 million in 2020; $4 million in 2019.\n\n6. **Totals**:\n   - Total assets were $9,161 million in 2020 and $5,823 million in 2019.\n   - Total liabilities were $627 million in 2020 and $673 million in 2019.\n\nThe fair value hierarchy levels refer to the methodology used to value the assets and liabilities: Level 1 involves quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 involves observable inputs other than quoted prices,\n(2)  Available-for-sale debt securities with carrying values that approximate fair value. \n\n \n(3)  Included within investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n \n(4)  Primarily includes time deposits and U.S. treasury bills that are reported within marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n \n(5)  Primarily includes government and corporate debt securities that are reported within investments and sundry assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \n\n \n(8)  The gross balances of derivative liabilities contained within other accrued expenses and liabilities, and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet  at December 31, 2020 were  $\\S587$   million and   $\\S40$   million, respectively, and at December 31, 2019 were   $\\mathbb{S}\\bar{\\mathbf{\\Omega}}67$   million and   $\\S506$   million, respectively.  N/A – Not applicable  \nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value  \nShort-Term Receivables and Payables  \nNotes and other accounts receivable and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value.  Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt and including short- term finance lease liabilities) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the  financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt  which would be classified as Level 2.  \nLoans and Long-Term Receivables  \nFair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit  ratings for the same remaining maturities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated  fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial  instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  \nLong-Term Debt  \nFair value of publicly traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an  active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available,  an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining  maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was   $\\S54{,}355$   million and   $^{\\S54,102}$   million, and the  estimated fair value was  $^{\\S61,598}$   million and  $^{\\S58,431}$   million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. If measured at fair value  in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  "}

In anticipation of these foreign\ncurrency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward\ncontracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum remaining length\nof time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years. At\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty\nand cost transactions was $8.0 billion and $9.7 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average remaining\nmaturity of these instruments was approximately 0.7 years and 0.8 years, respectively.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company\nrecorded net losses of $192 million and net gains of $145 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI.

To manage this risk, the company employs\n\ncross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional\ncurrency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2020, the maximum length of\ntime remaining over which the company has hedged its exposure was approximately seven years. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was $1.5\nbillion and $8.2 billion, respectively. The primary driver of the $6.7 billion decrease in cross-currency swaps is part of the company’s\nrisk management strategy to use the previously hedged foreign currency denominated debt as a hedge of net investment in foreign\nsubsidiaries.\n\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, in connection with cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings, the company\nrecorded net losses of $236 million and net losses of $185 million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that\n$23 million (before taxes) of deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at December 31, 2020 will be reclassified to net income within\nthe next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying exposure.\n\nSubsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management\nThe company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to\n\nconvert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses foreign exchange forward contracts to economically\nhedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The\nterms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than one year. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of\nthe underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income\nStatement. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign\ncurrency exposure was $6.8 billion and $7.1 billion, respectively.\n\nEquity Risk Management\n\nThe company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock primarily related to\ncertain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG&A\nexpense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives,\nincluding equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The\nderivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock, and are\nrecorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At December 31,\n2020 and 20149, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $1.3\nbillion at both periods.\n\nCumulative Basis Adjustments for Fair Value Hedges\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following amounts were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to cumulative basis\nadjustments for fair value hedges:\n\n($ in millions)\nAt December 31: 2020 2019\nShort-term debt:\nCarrying amount of the hedged item $(1,302) $ -\nCumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount—assets/ (liabilities) (2) -\nLong-term debt:\nCarrying amount of the hedged item (2,097) (3,411)\nCumulative hedging adjustments included in the carrying amount—assets/(liabilities)* (424) (440)\n\n* Includes ($353) million and ($404) million of hedging adjustments on discontinued hedging relationships at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n", "vlm_text": "Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions  \nThe company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for  royalties and goods and services among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign  currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward  contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. The maximum remaining length  of time over which the company has hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is approximately four years. At  December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty  and cost transactions was  $\\S8.0$   billion and  $\\S9.7$   billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average remaining  maturity of these instruments was approximately 0.7 years and 0.8 years, respectively.  \nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company  recorded net losses of  $\\S192$   million and net gains of  $\\S145$   million (before taxes), respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that   $\\S285$   million (before taxes) of deferred net losses on derivatives in AOCI at December 31, 2020 will be reclassified to net income within  the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.  \nForeign Currency Denominated Borrowings  \nThe company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company employs  cross-currency swaps to convert fixed-rate foreign currency denominated debt to fixed-rate debt denominated in the functional  currency of the borrowing entity. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At December 31, 2020, the maximum length of  time remaining over which the company has hedged its exposure was approximately seven years. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,  the total notional amount of cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt was   $\\S1.5$  billion and  $\\S8.2$   billion, respectively.

Cash flows from the company’s expected benefit obligation payments are matched to the yield\ncurve to derive the discount rates.\n\nIn other non-U.S. countries where the markets for high-quality long-term bonds are not as well developed, a\nportfolio of long-term government bonds is used as a base, and a credit spread is added to simulate corporate\nbond yields at these maturities in the jurisdiction of each plan. This is the benchmark for developing the\nrespective discount rates.\n\nExpected Represents the expected long-term returns on plan assets based on the calculated market-related value of\nLong-Term plan assets and considers long-term expectations for future returns and the investment policies and strategies\nReturns on discussed on pages 134 to 135. These rates of return are developed and tested for reasonableness against\nPlan Assets historical returns by the company.\n\nThe use of expected returns may result in pension income that is greater or less than the actual return of those\nplan assets in a given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate\nthe actual long-term returns, and therefore result in a pattern of income or loss recognition that more closely\nmatches the pattern of the services provided by the employees.\n\nThe difference between actual and expected returns is recognized as a component of net loss or gain in AOCI,\nwhich is amortized as a component of net periodic (income)/cost over the service lives or life expectancy of the\nplan participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed certain thresholds provided by\naccounting standards. The market-related value of plan assets recognizes changes in the fair value of plan\nassets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic\n(income)/cost.\n\nThe projected long-term rate of return on plan assets for 2021 is 3.75 percent for U.S. and 2.86 percent for\nnon-U.S. DB Plans.\n\nRate of Compensation rate increases are determined based on the company’s long-term plans for such increases.\nCompensation | These rate increases are not applicable to the U.S. DB pension plans as benefit accruals ceased December 31,\nIncreasesand | 2007.\n\nMortality\n\nAssumptions Mortality assumptions are based on life expectancy and death rates for different types of participants and are\n\nperiodically updated based on actual experience.\n\nInterest Benefits for certain participants in the PPP are calculated using a cash balance formula. An assumption\n\nCrediting Rate | underlying this formula is an interest crediting rate, which impacts both net periodic (income)/cost and the\nPBO. This provides the basis for projecting the expected interest rate that plan participants will earn on the\nbenefits that they are expected to receive in the following year and is based on the average from August to\nOctober of the one-year U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yield plus one percent.\n\nHealthcare For nonpension postretirement benefit plans, the company reviews external data and its own historical trends\nCost Trend for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates. The healthcare cost trend rate has an\nRate insignificant effect on plan costs or the benefit obligation due to the terms of the plan which limit the\n\ncompany’s obligation to the participants.\n\nThe company’s U.S. healthcare cost trend rate assumption for 2021 is 6.25 percent. The company assumes\nthat trend rate will decrease to 5.0 percent over the next six years.\n\nPlan Assets\nRetirement-related benefit plan assets are recognized and measured at fair value. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuations,\nthese fair value measurements may not necessarily reflect the amounts the company could realize in current market transactions.\n\nInvestment Policies and Strategies\n\nThe investment objectives of the Qualified PPP portfolio are designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future\nobligations. The precise amount for which these obligations will be settled depends on future events, including the retirement dates\nand life expectancy of the plans’ participants. The obligations are estimated using actuarial assumptions, based on the current\neconomic environment and other pertinent factors described above. The Qualified PPP portfolio’s investment strategy balances the\nrequirement to generate returns, using potentially higher yielding assets such as equity securities, with the need to control risk in the\nportfolio with less volatile assets, such as fixed-income securities. Risks include, among others, inflation, volatility in equity values and\nchanges in interest rates that could cause the plan to become underfunded, thereby increasing its dependence on contributions from\nthe company.

It is organized into five main items, each with a corresponding description explaining their significance and basis for calculation:\n\n1. **Discount Rate**: This section discusses how changes in discount rate assumptions affect net periodic income or cost and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). It explains the use of high-quality corporate bonds for determining discount rates in the U.S. and other countries, while noting specific adjustments for countries with less developed bond markets.\n\n2. **Expected Long-Term Returns on Plan Assets**: This part describes the assumptions for expected long-term returns on plan assets, emphasizing their basis on historical returns and future expectations. It mentions the impact of the expected returns on net periodic (income)/cost and how deviations from actual returns are managed. Specific projected rates for 2021 are given for U.S. and non-U.S. plans.\n\n3. **Rate of Compensation Increases and Mortality Assumptions**: Here, the table outlines how compensation rate increases are determined based on long-term company plans and clarifies that these do not apply to U.S. DB pension plans post-2007. Mortality assumptions are periodically updated based on life expectancy and death rates.\n\n4. **Interest Crediting Rate**: This section details how benefits for certain plan participants are calculated using an interest crediting rate, affecting net periodic income/cost and PBO. It explains the basis for projecting expected interest rates using U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity yields.\n\n5. **Healthcare Cost Trend Rate**: This part explains how the healthcare cost trend rate for nonpension postretirement benefits is decided, incorporating external data and historical trends. It specifies that a healthcare trend rate assumption has little impact on plan costs due to plan limitations. The projected U.S. healthcare cost trend rate for 2021 and expectations for its future decrease are provided.\n\nOverall, the table explains the financial assumptions underlying the company's handling of pension and postretirement benefits, including their impact and rationale.\nPlan Assets  \nRetirement-related benefit plan assets are recognized and measured at fair value.

If available, they are valued using the closing price\nreported on the major market on which the individual securities are traded.\n\nCash includes money market accounts that are valued at their cost plus interest on a daily basis, which approximates fair value. Short-\nterm investments represent securities with original maturities of one year or less. These assets are classified as Level 1 or Level 2.\n\nReal estate valuations require significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the\nlong-term nature of such assets. These assets are initially valued at cost and are reviewed periodically utilizing available and relevant\nmarket data, including appraisals, to determine if the carrying value of these assets should be adjusted. These assets are classified as\nLevel 3.\n\nExchange-traded derivatives are valued at the closing price reported on the exchange on which the individual securities are traded,\nwhile forward contracts are valued using a mid-close price. Over-the-counter derivatives are typically valued using pricing models. The\nmodels require a variety of inputs, including, for example, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility and foreign exchange rates.\nThese assets are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 depending on availability of quoted market prices.\n", "vlm_text": "The table presents the financial activities and balances related to Corporate Bonds and Mortgage and Asset-Backed Securities for the year 2019.
