As an example, we are focused on building closer direct relationships with customers. When it comes to market cycles, these  relationships provide improved insight into customer demand and allow us to more accurately and efficiently manage factory  loadings and inventory levels, which lead to more stable lead times and higher product availability. Finally, we focus our  resources on analog and embedded processing products and industrial and automotive markets. Generally, our products serve     a large and diverse customer base, which reduces our dependence on the performance of any single product, market or  customer. In addition, they typically have long shelf lives and low risk of obsolescence. Industrial and automotive markets    also benefit from long product life cycles, with revenue often lasting 10 years or more, which help to smooth the impact of  cyclicality.

In the United States, we use a settlement approach whereby a portfolio of bonds  is selected from the universe of actively traded high-quality U.S. corporate bonds.

In this manner, a  present value is developed. The discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produces the same present value.

{"layout": 962, "type": "text", "text": "x   Our primary objective is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. To achieve this objective,  the company’s strategy is comprised of having a great business model, a disciplined approach to  capital allocation and a focus on efficiency.  x   The company’s business model is designed around four sustainable competitive advantages that in  combination put us in a unique class of companies. These advantages include (i) a strong foundation of  manufacturing and technology, (ii) a broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products,   (iii) the reach of our market channels and (iv) diversity and longevity of our products, markets and  customer positions. In 2020, the company continued to strengthen and leverage these advantages.  x   The company’s strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end  markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems  and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, the company places additional strategic  emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we  believe represent the best growth opportunities. In 2020, the company continued the disciplined  allocation of R&D spending to strengthen its product portfolio, building on the existing foundation for  near- and long-term results.  o   TI’s broad analog and embedded processing product portfolio includes tens of thousands of  products, with more products added each year, offering strong differentiation and longevity. In  2020, greater than 90 percent of TI’s revenue came from Analog and Embedded Processing  semiconductors.  o   We believe the industrial and automotive markets represent the best growth opportunity for the  industry for the foreseeable future because of the increasing semiconductor content in these  markets. In 2020, approximately 57 percent of TI’s revenue came from industrial and automotive  markets.  x   TI’s revenue continues to come from a diverse base of thousands of applications. This is an intentional  strategy that prevents dependence on a single market, customer or product.  x   In 2020, the company made progress in building closer, direct relationships with its customers to  further strengthen and extend its reach of market channels. To enable this transition, the company has  made multi-year investments in its sales and applications team, TI.com, business processes, logistics  and distribution channel changes. In 2020, the company accelerated these efforts, with the percent of  direct business growing from   $37\\%$   in 2019 to   $48\\%$   in 2020, including ending the year with  $63\\%$   of  revenue direct in December 2020. TI’s reach of market channels provides access to more customers  and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more TI products into each design,  and also provides better insight and knowledge of customers’ needs and design trends.  x   TI’s in-house capability to manufacture high volumes of Analog semiconductors on 300-millimeter  wafers remains a competitive advantage due to the inherent cost advantage associated with 300- millimeter technology versus prior generation. This cost advantage is the result of more chips being  produced per wafer, thereby improving margins and cash generation. In 2020, the company began  construction of its third 300-millimeter wafer fabrication facility, located in Richardson, Texas.  x   In total, the committee determined that TI’s strategic position was strengthened by management’s  decisions and actions in 2020.

Delaware law  and SEC rules provide a meeting framework that promotes informed and deliberate engagement among a company’s  stockholders. Action by written consent ignores that framework. When stockholders are asked to take action at a  meeting, those soliciting votes are obligated to provide materials that inform the stockholder of the actions to be  considered and the consequences of any outcomes. That obligation is not required of written consent solicitations, with  the result that stockholders could be requested to take action without all necessary information and without appropriate  time to deliberate. Written consent further disenfranchises stockholders by eliminating the requirement that all  stockholders participate in key corporate decisions. Because only some stockholders need be solicited for their  consent, others lose the opportunity to engage on the requested action.     x   Stockholders already have several methods through which they can influence company practices without acting  by written consent.  Primarily, our annual stockholder meeting provides an opportunity for stockholders to provide  direct feedback by voting on director nominees, executive compensation, auditor selection and other matters that come  before the meeting, or to ask questions of management. If stockholders make the board or management aware of  events warranting stockholder action between annual meetings, the by-laws permit the Chairman, CEO, or Secretary to  call a special meeting of stockholders. Stockholders may also bring specific items of business before the company and  other stockholders by submitting proposals for inclusion in the company’s proxy materials to be voted on at the  meeting, or to be voted on at the meeting without being included in company proxy materials.
