The developing world faces   a significant shortfall in investment in infrastructure, leading some countries toaccept   financing from countries with little regard for quality, life cycle costs, environmental and   social impacts, debt sustainability, and long-term effects on diplomatic and commercial   relationships.

The Blue Dot Network (BDN)   will give companies confidence a certified project meets those standards. This creates a number of natural incentives for private sector companies to join the initiative. EB, with   USAID, strengthens countries capacities to evaluate projects and coordinates U.S.   assistance and private-sector-led infrastructure investment through the Infrastructure   Transaction and Assistance Network (ITAN) and its associated Transaction Advisory Fund   (TAF), which promotes transparency and levels the playing field for U.S. businesses.
