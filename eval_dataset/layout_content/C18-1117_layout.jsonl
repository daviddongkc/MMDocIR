In the ﬁeld of theoretical (diachronic) linguistics, much attention has been devoted to expressing regularities of linguistic change. For instance, laws of phonological change have been formulated (e.g., Grimm’s law or the great vowel shift) to account for changes in the linguistic sound system. When it comes to lexical semantics, linguists have studied the evolution of word meaning over time, describing so-called lexical  semantic shifts  or  semantic change , which Bloomﬁeld (1933) deﬁnes as “innovations which change the lexical meaning rather than the grammatical function of a form.” ", "page_idx": 1, "bbox": [72, 358.7650451660156, 525, 453.20556640625], "page_size": [595.2760009765625, 841.8900146484375]}

Bloomﬁeld (1933) originally proposed nine classes of semantic shifts, six of which are complimentary pairs along a di- mension. For instance, the pair ‘narrowing’ – ‘broadening’ describes the observation that word meaning often changes to become either more speciﬁc or more general, e.g. Old English  mete  ‘food’ becomes English  meat  ‘edible ﬂesh,’ or that the more general English word  dog  is derived from Middle English dogge  which described a dog of a particular breed.

Linguistic pro- cesses that cause semantic shifts generally involve the interaction between words of the vocabulary and their meanings. This may be illustrated by the process of ellipsis, whereby the meaning of one word is transferred to a word with which it frequently co-occurs, or by the need for discrimination of synonyms caused by lexical borrowings from other languages. Semantic shifts may be also be caused by changes in the attitudes of speakers or in the general environment of the speakers. Thus, semantic shifts are natu- rally separated into two important classes: linguistic drifts (slow and regular changes in core meaning of words) and cultural shifts (culturally determined changes in associations of a given word). Researchers studying semantic shifts from a computational point of view have shown the existence of this division empirically (Hamilton et al., 2016c). In the traditional classiﬁcation of Stern (1931), the semantic shift category of  substitution  describes a change that has a non-linguistic cause, namely that of technologi- cal progress. This may be exempliﬁed by the word  car  which shifted its meaning from non-motorized vehicles after the introduction of the automobile.

A key assumption in much of this work is that changes in a word’s collocational patterns reﬂect changes in word meaning (Hilpert, 2008), thus providing a usage-based account of semantics (Gries, 1999). For instance, Kerremans et al. (2010) study the very recent neologism  detweet , showing the development of two separate usages/meanings for this word (‘to delete from twitter,’ vs ‘to avoid tweeting’) based on large amounts of web-crawled data. The usage-based view of lexical semantics aligns well with the assumptions underlying the distri- butional semantic approach (Firth, 1957) often employed in NLP . Here, the time spans studied are often considerably shorter (decades, rather than centuries) and we ﬁnd that these distributional methods seem well suited for monitoring the gradual process of meaning change.

Thus, if one were able to more directly model word meaning, such an approach should be superior to frequency-proxied methods. A number of recent publications have showed that  distributional word representations  (Turney et al., 2010; Baroni et al., 2014) provide an efﬁcient way to solve these tasks. They represent meaning with sparse or dense (em- bedding) vectors, produced from word co-occurrence counts. Although conceptually the source of the data for these models is still word frequencies, they ‘compress’ this information into continuous lexical representations which are both efﬁcient and convenient to work with. Indeed, Kulkarni et al. (2015) explicitly demonstrated that distributional models outperform the frequency-based methods in detecting semantic shifts. They managed to trace semantic shifts more precisely and with greater explanatory power.

The reason is that most modern word embedding algorithms are inherently stochastic and the resulting embedding sets are invariant under rotation. Thus, even when trained on the same data, separate learning runs will produce entirely different numerical vectors (though with roughly the same pairwise similarities between vectors for particular words). This is expressed even stronger for models trained on different corpora. It means that even if word meaning is completely stable, the direct cosine similarity between its vectors from different time periods can still be quite low, simply because the random initializations of the two models were different. To alleviate this, Kulkarni et al. (2015) suggested that before calculating similarities, one should ﬁrst  align  the models to ﬁt them in one vector space, using linear transformations preserving general vector space structure. Af- ter that, cosine similarities across models become meaningful and can be used as indicators of semantic shifts.

{"layout": 74, "type": "text", "text": "•  Carefully designed and robust  gold standard test sets  of semantic shifts (of different kinds) should be created. This is a difﬁcult task in itself, but the experience from synchronic word embeddings evaluation (Hill et al., 2015) and other NLP areas proves that it is possible. •  There is a need for rigorous  formal mathematical models of diachronic embeddings . Arguably, this will follow the vein of research in joint learning across several time spans, started by Bamler and Mandt (2017) and Yao et al. (2018), but other directions are also open. •  Most current studies stop after stating the simple fact that a semantic shift has occurred. However, more detailed analysis of the nature of the shift is needed. This includes: 1.  Sub-classiﬁcation of types of semantic shifts  (broadening, narrowing, etc). This problem was to some degree addressed by Mitra et al. (2014), but much more work is certainly required to empirically test classiﬁcation schemes proposed in much of the theoretical work described in Section 2. 2.  Identifying the source of a shift  (for example, linguistic or extra-linguistic causes). This cau- sation detection is closely linked to the division between linguistic drifts and cultural shifts, as proposed in Hamilton et al. (2016c). 3.  Quantifying the weight of senses  acquired over time. Many words are polysemous, and the relative importance of senses is ﬂexible (Frermann and Lapata, 2016). The issue of handling senses is central for detecting semantic shifts, but most of the algorithms described in this sur- vey are not sense-aware. To address this, methods from sense embeddings research (Bartunov et al., 2016) might be employed. 4.  Identifying groups of words that shift together  in correlated ways. Some work in this direction was started in Dubossarsky et al. (2016), who showed that verbs change more than nouns, and nouns change more than adjectives. This is also naturally related to proving the (non-)existence of the ‘laws of semantic change’ (see Section 4). •  Last but not least, we believe that the community around diachronic word embeddings research severely lacks relevant forums, like  topical workshops  or  shared tasks . Diachronic text evaluation tasks like the one at  SemEval-2015  (Popescu and Strapparava, 2015) are important but not enough, since they focus on identifying the time period when a text was authored, not the process of shifting meanings of a word. Organizing such events can promote the ﬁeld and help address many of the challenges described above.
