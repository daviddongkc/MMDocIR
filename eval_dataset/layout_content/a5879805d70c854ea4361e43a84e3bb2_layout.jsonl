The statements drawn from TD Bank’s Code of Conduct and Ethics were neither deliberately  nor unintentionally false or misleading either and Plaintiffs have not adduced any evidence of  unethical, illegal or predatory practices which supposedly render this reputation al roadmap  obsolete;  \n\n 62.  In particular, the Plaintiffs have failed to prove any supposed Pressure Selling Program and  have instead gratuitously made up this term based on analogies to the cross-selling scandal  involving Wells Fargo. During his deposition, Craig McFadzean admitted he had no knowledge  of the origin of the term. The disingenuous and inappropriate use of this colourful definition in  the Application is not a lawful substitute for evidence; \n\n 63.  Moreover, the Plaintiffs’ concurrent reliance on the hearsay allegations included in the CBC  Reports is equally unavailing. These reports only in turn refer to vague, un verifiable,  unsubstantiated and subjective opinions of a few supposed yet unidentified tellers and  managers; \n\n 64.  The CBC Reports fail to identify any employees who were supposedly fired or threatened as  well as any meaningful evidence of actual unrealistic incentive targets and policies. They do  not provide any crucial context necessary to assess any of the breaches allegedly committed.  They do not contain or refer to any actual witness statements or reports derived from the  alleged clandestine investigation of five Vancouver branches. The reports also fail to identify  any minimal verification s of the supposed employee affirmations which it appears were given  repeated airtime merely because they could be utilized as fodder for predatory and sensational  journalism; \n\n 65.

This is also true in respect of the Plaintiffs’ further allegation that TD Bank’s reported Canadian  retail revenue increases were misleading since they omitted to identify that they purportedly  were attributable to mis-selling programs and practices; \n\n 69.  Material it y is an essential and express condition or component of any statutory  misrepresentation. Even if a single misrepresentation had been factually established, which is  vehemently denied, it could not trigger any statutory securities relief, absent an additional  finding of material it y; \n\n 70.  It is also trite law that material it y involves a case-by-case application of a legal standard to a  specific and contextual factual matrix;  \n\n 71.  The burden to establish material it y rests squarely with the Plaintiffs and cannot be presumed  save when common sense inferences are warranted, which is clearly not the case here;  \n\n 72.  The Plaintiffs’ failure to meet this burden is glaring for a number of fundamental reasons  including the fact that they rely at the outset, on the wrong standard – the reasonable investor  test – to determine material it y; \n\n 73.  The QSA's approach to material it y is not grounded on a reasonable investor test but rather on  a narrower market impact test; \n\n 74.  While the distinction between disclosures of material fact and changes is paramount, both are  specifically subject to an objective market impact test as appears from the unequivocal wording  of Sections 5 and 5.3 of the QSA. The same is true for all other statutory securities schemes  adopted in Canada;  \n\n 75.  Plaintiffs’ allegation pertaining to material it y, set forth at paragraph 96 of the Application, is not  only grammatically in congruent but is also predicated on a purported expert report (Exhibit P- 24), which repeatedly invokes and relies on the reasonable investor test to arrive at erroneous  conclusions of market impact;  \n\n 76.  The statutory definition of material it y does not rest on a plurality of possible factors which could  have been considered by the reasonable investor but rather on whether the particular  misrepresentations alleged could objectively have had a significant effect on the market price  or value of the shares in question; \n\n 77.  The market impact test is defined in strictly economic terms and limits actionable  misrepresentations to those which impact the objective interest of all investors in a financial  return. It represents a legislative choice to prudently balance consumer protection imperatives  and the promotion of sound economic policy;  \n\n 78.  Remarkably, the Plaintiffs are fully aware that TD Bank's financial statements were never  restated following the purported CBC Reports’ corrective disclosures and that no sanctions,  criminal or regulatory were ever asserted let alone levied against the Bank or its directors and  officers in relation to the CBC Reports;    \n\n ", "page_idx": 8, "bbox": [70, 61.06721496582031, 555, 682.68115234375], "page_size": [612.0, 792.0]}

These facts alone suffice to preclude any finding of material it y and thus any  misrepresentations, including the alleged omitted disclosure of supposed mis-selling and its  enhancement of domestic non-interest retail revenues; \n\n 80.  Purported instances of mis-selling which are insufficient to precipitate or compel a restatement  of revenues cannot be seriously qualified as significantly impactful to the capital markets and  are thus immaterial;  \n\n 81.  Moreover, given TD Bank's market capitalization and its 81,000-plus employees’ engagement  in Canadian retail activities in 1,165 branches with 15 million customers, it is inconceivable that  isolated concerns would have had any significant effect on the market price or value of TD  Bank stock during the Class Period; \n\n 82.  Only systemic mis-selling practices could potentially have had a significant impact on the  markets. As discussed earlier, the inadmissible CBC Reports communicated as Exhibits P-10  and P-11 do not establish any actual evidence and in any event did not refer to any widespread  or systemic business practice violations; \n\n 83.  It is the Plaintiffs alone who have without any factual basis alleged widespread and systemic  mis-selling. Even their expert report (Exhibit P-24) has instead recognized this absence of  systemic evidence by relying entirely on an assumption of the truthfulness of Plaintiffs’  allegations; \n\n 84.  The FCAC was established in 2001 by the Government of Canada as an independent agency,  responsible for monitoring and enforcing compliance with consumer protection legislation,  regulations and industry commitments by federally regulated financial entities. The Plaintiffs  and their expert were or ought to have been fully aware prior to filing suit that the FCAC had  launched an investigation into the domestic retail sales practices of Canada’s six leading  banks, following the above mentioned CBC Reports, and had concluded that there was no  evidence of any systemic or widespread mis-selling practices at TD Bank and these other  banks;  \n\n 85.  The FCAC did so following the review of 4500 complaints, 100,000 pages of sales incentive,  compliance and governance banking documentation and 600 interviews with bank personnel  including board chairs and directors, senior management, middle management and frontline  employees ;  \n\n 86.  The Courts have long ago confirmed that class actions are not commissions of inquiry and  should not be utilized to attempt to overturn the findings of industry regulators merely to please  unharmed and opportunistic Plaintiffs; \n\n 87.
