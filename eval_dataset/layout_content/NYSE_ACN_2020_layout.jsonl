In addition, the European Commission has expanded upon the OECD guidelines with  anti-tax avoidance directives to be applied by its member states.

{"layout": 280, "type": "text", "text": "• Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct  inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S.  government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including  allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation.  These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information  technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our  government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply  with applicable IT security requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of  law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government  concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated  estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already  been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates  for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system,  may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result  of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced  some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences,  which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations. \n\n • If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become  subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative  sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and  suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of  internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities. \n\n • U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and disclosure obligations. Disclosure is required if  certain company personnel have knowledge of “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud,  overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or  debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact  contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters also could lead to audits or investigations and other civil,  criminal or administrative sanctions.  Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with  commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more  extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its  accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.  Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate.  For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment  terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.  Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and  executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these  projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments,  including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could  result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of  incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient  funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our  investments.  Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among  key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues  can affect the number and terms of new government contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed,  decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in  areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules  or laws is assessed.  Our ability to work for the U.S. government is impacted by the fact that we are an Irish company. We elected to enter into  a proxy agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense that enhances the ability of our U.S. federal government  contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the U.S. government. The proxy agreement regulates the management  and operation of, and limits the control we can exercise over, this subsidiary. In addition, legislative and executive  proposals remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future, which, if enacted, could place additional  limitations on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contracts in the United States or  could include requirements that would otherwise affect our results of operations. Various U.S. federal and state  legislative proposals have been introduced and/or enacted in recent years that deny government contracts to certain  U.S. companies that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the United States. While Accenture was not a U.S.  company that reincorporated outside the United States, it is possible that these contract bans and other legislative  proposals could be applied in a way that negatively affects Accenture.
