The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery,  and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States  or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court  denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to  have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and  enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against  Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague,  under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that  the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was  procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates  international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered  Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries  resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador  owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the  Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is  fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a  separate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of  the United States Trade Representative in July 2020. Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is  illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced.

One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on  the merits, and one of the county lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. The lawsuits assert various causes of  action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence,  impairment of public trust, and violations of consumer protection statutes, based upon the company’s production of oil and  gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products.  The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability (both  compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement and  disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits, that, while we believe remote, could have a  material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Further such proceedings are likely  to be filed by other parties. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from  constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against  such proceedings.
