The goal is to develop a science-based system  to help consumers better understand the environmental impact of cosmetics,  from sourcing ingredients to a product’s manufacturing, transport and use, as  well as the bio de grad ability of its formula. \nIn parallel, LVMH and its Perfumes & Cosmetics Maisons use in-house tools  and indicators such as EPI (Environmental Performance Index) scores for  product packaging and EFI (Environmental Formulation Index) scores for  ingredients. They facilitate and accelerate sustainable design by taking into  account factors such as the amount of recycled content in packaging and the  proportion of natural ingredients in formulas. \nThe image is an advertisement for Parfums Kenzo.

The flowers were sewn  by some one hundred women in four workshops supported by Dessine  L’Espoir (Designing Hope), a humanitarian organization that helps vulnerable  populations in several southern African countries, notably in South Africa  and Eswatini. The nonprofit has been running HIV awareness campaigns  since 2003 and supports people who are HIV-positive with healthcare and  food, also providing education and training for the youngest. The flower  brooches were sold throughout the event and the proceeds were donated  to Dessine l’Espoir. \nThe image shows two interior views of Le Bon Marché, a famous department store in Paris. On the left, there is an art installation that features a large, stylized sunburst made of yellow elements with the text \"RAYONS DE SOLEIL SUR LA RIVE GAUCHE,\" which translates to \"Sunrays on the Left Bank.\" This is installed above an escalator area. On the right, another art installation features an array of colorful hanging flowers or petals, creating a vibrant and whimsical canopy effect within the store's atrium. Both installations emphasize a bright and inviting shopping environment."}
