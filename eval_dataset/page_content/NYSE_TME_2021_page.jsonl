If we are unable to identify comprehensive and accurate copyright owner information for the music or long-form audio\ncontent offered on our platform, such as identifying which composers, publishers or collective copyright organizations own, administer, license or\nsublicense music or long-form audio works, or if we are unable to determine which music or long-form audio works correspond to specific recordings, it\nmay be difficult for us to (i) identify the appropriate copyright owners to whom to pay royalties or from whom to obtain a license or (ii) ascertain\nwhether the scope of a license we have obtained covers specific music or long-form audio works. This also may make it difficult to comply with the\nobligations of any agreements with those rights holders.\n\nIf we do not obtain necessary and commercially viable licenses from copyright owners, whether due to the inability to identify or verify the\nappropriate copyright owners or for any other reason, we may be found to have infringed on the copyright of others, potentially resulting in claims for\nmonetary damages, government fines and penalties, or a reduction of content available to users on our platform, which would adversely affect our ability\nto retain and expand our user base, attract paying users for our paid music and long-form audio services and generate revenue from our content library.\nAny such inability may also involve us in expensive and protracted copyright disputes.\n\nIf music copyright owners withdraw all or a portion of their music works from the MCSC to the extent the MCSC had not obtained authorization\nto license from the relevant copyright owners, we may have to enter into direct licensing agreements with these copyright owners, which may be\ntime-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to reach an agreement with some copyright owners, or may have to pay higher rates than we\ncurrently pay.\n\nBased on the framework agreement we previously entered into with the MCSC, we obtained licenses from the MCSC with respect to musical\ncomposition and lyrics for a substantial portion of our music content library.

If online music, live streaming or long-form audio as forms of entertainment lose their popularity due to changing social trends and user preferences, or if such industries in China fail to grow as quickly as expected, our business, financial condition and results of operation may be materially and adversely affected. \nWe operate in a competitive industry. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share to our competitors. \nWe operate in a competitive industry. We face competition for users and their time and spending primarily from the online music services provided by other online music services providers in China. We also face competition from online offerings of other forms of content, including long- form audio, karaoke services, live streaming, radio services, literature, games and video provided by other social entertainment services providers. In particular, we are increasingly facing noticeable competition from offerings of other emerging forms of content which have been growing in popularity rapidly in recent years, such as live streaming and user-generated short videos. \nWe compete with our competitors based on a number of factors, such as the diversity and quality of content, product features, social interaction features, quality of user experience, brand awareness and reputation, and our ability to continuously attract, incentivize and retain live streaming performers and their agencies. Some of our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to technological innovations or changes in user demands and preferences, acquire more attractive and diverse content, and act more effectively in the development, promotion and sale of products than we can. Also, they may enter into more favorable relationships with content providers and provide their users with content that competes with our offerings. If any of our competitors achieves greater market acceptance or is able to provide more attractive content offerings than we do, our user traffic and market share may decrease, which may result in a loss of users and a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As a result of the merger of CMC’s operations and Tencent’s\nformer music businesses in 2016, Ocean Culture and Ocean Technology also became our PRC consolidated entities.\n\nThe Claimant alleged that Mr. Xie defrauded and threatened him into signing a series of agreements in late 2013 to relinquish his substantial\ninvestment interests in multiple entities, including CMC, Ocean Culture and Ocean Technology (together, the “Ocean Music Entities”), and transferring\nhis equity interests in the Ocean Music Entities to Mr. Xie, CMC and certain other Respondents at below-market value. The Claimant seeks an award\nfrom CIETAC ruling, among other things, that (i) such agreements, pursuant to which the Claimant allegedly transferred his interests in the Ocean\nMusic Entities to Mr. Xie, CMC and other Respondents, be declared invalid; (ii) Mr. Xie, CMC and other applicable Respondents return to the Claimant\nall of his initial equity interests in the Ocean Music Entities; and (iii) Mr. Xie pays damages in the amount of RMB100 million (US$15.7 million). In\nMarch 2021, the Claimant amended his claims so that, among other things, to the extent that the Claimant’s equity interests in the Ocean Music Entities\ncannot be returned to the Claimant as a result of the merger of CMC’s operations and Tencent’s former music businesses, each of Mr. Xie and we shall\npay the Claimant damages in an amount equal to the fair market value of 4% of our share capital as of the date of enforcement of the final arbitration\ndecision, minus the amount the Claimant has already received, plus accrued interests. In April 2021, CIETAC entered an award for the Arbitration. The\naward dismissed substantially all of the Claimant’s claims, including those against CMC, except that Mr. Xie shall pay damages in an amount of\nRMB661 million (US$103.7 million) to the Claimant. Mr. Xie subsequently applied in court to set aside the CIETAC’s award, and the court case has\nbeen filed. As of the date of this annual report, no court hearing had been held in relation to this case. There can be no assurance that the final award for\nthe Arbitration will be so recognized by the court.

With the expansion of our business, we may be required to upgrade our technology and infrastructure to keep up with the increasing traffic on our platform. We cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure and telecommunications networks in China will be able to support the demands associated with the continued growth in internet usage. If we were unable to increase our online content and service delivering capacity accordingly, we may not be able to continuously grow our internet traffic and the adoption of our products and services may be hindered, which could adversely impact our business and our share price. \nIn addition, we generally have no control over the costs of the services provided by telecommunications service providers. If the prices we pay for telecommunications and internet services rise significantly, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. If internet access fees or other charges to internet users increase, our user traffic may decline and our business may be harmed. \nChanges in China’s economic, political and social conditions as well as government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospect. \nSubstantially all of our operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospect, financial condition and results of operations may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally, and by continued economic growth in China as a whole. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the amount of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the Chinese government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the Chinese government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The Chinese government also exercises significant control over China’s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. \nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the Chinese government or in the laws and regulations in China could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect our business and operating results, lead to a reduction in demand for our services and adversely affect our competitive position. The Chinese government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the Chinese government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China. Any prolonged slowdown in the Chinese economy may reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. "}

While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedges may be limited and we may not be able to adequately hedge our exposure or at all. In addition, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert Renminbi into foreign currency. \nForeign exchange controls may limit our ability to utilize our revenues effectively and affect the value of your investment. \nThe PRC government imposes foreign exchange controls on the convertibility of the Renminbi, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of China. We receive substantially all of our revenues in Renminbi. Under our current corporate structure, our Cayman Islands holding company primarily relies on dividend payments from our PRC subsidiaries to fund any cash and financing requirements we may have. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval of SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. Specifically, under the existing exchange restrictions, without prior approval of SAFE, cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries in China may be used to pay dividends to our company. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where Renminbi is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, we need to obtain SAFE approval or registration to use cash generated from the operations of our PRC subsidiaries and VIE to pay off their respective debt in a currency other than Renminbi owed to entities outside China, or to make other capital expenditure payments outside China in a currency other than Renminbi. The PRC government may at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our shareholders and holders of the ADSs.

If the relevant PRC authorities determine that we shall make supplemental social insurance and housing fund contributions or that we are subject to fines and legal sanctions in relation to our failure to make social insurance and housing fund contributions in full for our employees, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. \nWe may be classified as a “PRC resident enterprise” for PRC enterprise income tax purposes, which could result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-PRC shareholders and ADS holders and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. \nUnder the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the PRC and its implementation rules, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with a “de facto management body” within the PRC is considered a “resident enterprise” and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income at the rate of  $25\\%$  . The implementation rules define the term “de facto management body” as the body that exercises full and substantial control over and overall management of the business, personnel, accounts and properties of an enterprise. In April 2009, the State Administration of Taxation issued a circular, known as SAT Circular 82, which provides certain specific criteria for determining whether the “de facto management body” of a PRC-controlled enterprise that is incorporated offshore is located in China. Although this circular only applies to offshore enterprises controlled by PRC enterprises or PRC enterprise groups, not those controlled by PRC individuals or foreigners like us, the criteria set forth in the circular may reflect the State Administration of Taxation’s general position on how the “de facto management body” test should be applied in determining the tax resident status of all offshore enterprises. According to SAT Circular 82, an offshore incorporated enterprise controlled by a PRC enterprise or a PRC enterprise group will be regarded as a PRC tax resident by virtue of having its “de facto management body” in China and will be subject to PRC enterprise income tax on its global income only if all of the following conditions are met: (i) the primary location of the day-to-day operational management is in the PRC; (ii) decisions relating to the enterprise’s financial and human resource matters are made or are subject to approval by organizations or personnel in the PRC; (iii) the enterprise’s primary assets, accounting books and records, "}

A determination that we have not timely filed financial statements in compliance with the SEC requirements could ultimately lead to the delisting of our ADSs from the NYSE or the termination of the registration of our ordinary shares under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or both, which would substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our ADSs in the United States. \nRisks Related to the ADSs or our Ordinary Shares \nThe trading price of the ADSs is likely to be volatile, which could result in substantial losses to investors. \nThe trading price of the ADSs is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate widely due to multiple factors, some of which are beyond our control. This may happen because of broad market and industry factors, including the performance and fluctuation of the market prices of other companies with business operations located mainly in China that have listed their securities in the United States. In addition to market and industry factors, the price and trading volume for the ADSs may be highly volatile for factors, including the following: \n•  variations in our revenues, operating costs and expenses, earnings and cash flow; •  our controlling shareholder’s business performance and the trading price of its stock; •  announcements of new investments, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures by us or our competitors; •  announcements of new products and services by us or our competitors; •  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; •  detrimental adverse publicity about us, our shareholders, affiliates, directors, officers or employees, our content offerings, our business model, our services or our industry; •  announcements of new regulations, rules or policies relevant for our business; •  additions or departures of key personnel; "}

Under PRC laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions with respect to paying dividends or otherwise transferring any of their net assets offshore to Tencent Music Entertainment Group. In particular, under the current effective PRC laws and regulations, dividends may be paid only out of distributable profits. Distributable profits are the net profit as determined under PRC GAAP, less any recovery of accumulated losses and appropriations to statutory and other reserves required to be made. Each of our PRC subsidiaries is required to set aside at least  $10\\%$   of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches  $50\\%$   of its registered capital. As a result, our PRC subsidiaries may not have sufficient distributable profits to pay dividends to us in the near future. \nFurthermore, if certain procedural requirements are satisfied, the payment of current account items, including profit distributions and trade and service related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from State Administration of Foreign Exchange (the “SAFE”) or its local branches. However, where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses, such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies, approval from or registration with competent government authorities or its authorized banks is required. The PRC government may take measures at its discretion from time to time to restrict access to foreign currencies for current account or capital account transactions. If the foreign exchange control system prevents us from obtaining sufficient foreign currencies to satisfy our foreign currency demands, we may not be able to pay dividends in foreign currencies to our offshore intermediary holding companies or ultimate parent company, and therefore, our shareholders or investors in our ADSs. Further, we cannot assure you that new regulations or policies will not be promulgated in the future, which may further restrict the remittance of RMB into or out of the PRC. We cannot assure you, in light of the restrictions in place, or any amendment to be made from time to time, that our current or future PRC subsidiaries will be able to satisfy their respective payment obligations that are denominated in foreign currencies, including the remittance of dividends outside of the PRC.

QQ Music acts as a platform for initial digital music releases and promotes interactions between music lovers and artists.\n\n2. **Kugou**: Recognized as a pioneer in the music entertainment industry in China, Kugou offers:\n   - **Kugou Music**: A leading online music service with various entertainment features, catering to a broad audience, including users in lower-tier cities.\n   - **Kugou Live**: A platform for streaming live music performances and variety shows, providing an interactive experience.\n\n3. **Kuwo**: This brand offers music entertainment services with a focus on users in Northern China and includes:\n   - **Kuwo Music**: Focused on selected genres and segments, like DJ mixes and children's songs, to suit diverse tastes.\n   - **Kuwo Live**: Similar to Kugou Live, it provides streams of music performances and variety shows.\n\n4. **WeSing**: The largest mobile karaoke social community, offering a platform to share singing performances and interact socially with others interested in music.\n\n5. **Lazy Audio**: A platform dedicated to long-form audio content, including audiobooks and other forms of entertainment like radio dramas.\nFrom a content library perspective,  QQ Music ,  Kugou Music  and  Kuwo Music  are substantially integrated as they share access to all the tracks that we license from music labels. While  QQ Music ,  Kugou Music  and  Kuwo   Music  are focused on different user segments with a low user overlap among themselves, we have a higher degree of user overlap between our online music services and social entertainment services as a result of the complementary nature of our products that attracts users from our online music services to our social entertainment services. We also adopt a holistic approach to operating our online music services and social entertainment services. \nWe have devoted substantial resources in building a vibrant ecosystem where users across our applications and content offerings can come together and celebrate their versatile entertainment experience on TME’s platform. For example, we have introduced our cross-platform, live streaming events to improve user engagement. In June 2021,  Kugou Live  and  WeSing  jointly hosted their first cross-platform competition, giving live stream performers broader exposure to both platforms and an effective way to tap into a new audience base, successfully increasing the vibrancy of both platforms. In September 2021,  Kugou Live ,  QQ Music  and  WeSing  jointly held another cross-platform competition, which set up an even larger stage for live stream performers to showcase their talents to a wider audience while improving user engagement on each single platform. In addition, by hosting Tencent Music Live Ceremony Live Streaming Gala in January 2022, we invited talented live stream "}

Alternatively, users may also register with and access our live streaming services using their mobile phone numbers, without  Weixin/WeChat  or  QQ  accounts. \nOur live streaming content features a broad range of performance categories such as singing, instrument playing and DJ performances by both professional artists and other performers. \nOur live streaming platforms cultivate an engaging and interactive environment for both the live streaming performers and the audience to create, discover, socialize and have fun together, mainly featuring the following: \n  Music-centric content . Most of our live streaming users also use our online music or online karaoke services. Our data analytics and AI technology enable us to provide recommendations of relevant live streaming content based on what our users are listening to or singing on our platform. For example, when a live streaming performer on  Kugou Live  performs a song, a message bubble pops up instantaneously on Kugou Music  notifying users listing to the same song. This allows users to seamlessly access this performer’s live streaming sessions on Kugou Live . \n  Social functions . Our social functions make everyone a part of the show. Performers and users interact in various formats, such as voice and text chatting, video chatting, rating a performer’s performance and sending virtual gifts. We also rank popularity of performers by value of virtual gifts. This validates and rewards good performances and lets the user base know what others enjoy, driving user engagement and loyalty. At any time during a live streaming session, users may choose to follow a performer to receive notifications of future performances. \n  Sing-offs . Live streaming performers can engage in a variety of real time singing and performance contests against each other to boost their popularity and rankings. Users can vote for and send virtual gifts to their favorite performers. \n  Song requests . Users can request to have a favorite song performed in exchange for a virtual gift. \n  Music events and talent shows . To further diversify our live streaming content offerings, we offer live stream concerts performed by professional artists as well as music events, music variety shows and fan meetings on our live streaming platforms to allow our users to support and interact with their favorite artists through various ways including online audience voting. \n  New forms of interaction . We bolster social and young attributes on  WeSing  by adding new forms of content such as mini live-streaming reality shows and new features such as universal duet that encourage users to interact. Virtual idols are another area where reality is increasingly merged with fantasy.  Shanbao , our self-created Chinese Ancient Style virtual idol, was successfully adopted in a wide range of cross-field use cases recently, including collaborations with popular games, emoji and soundmoji packages, conference hosting, offline performances and more, showcasing the viability of virtual IP monetization. \nWe encourage our live streaming performers to sing and engage in other music performance on our platform. Our live streaming platform becomes a large stage for performers to cultivate their fan base and easily access attractive revenue opportunities, enabling them to develop their artist image and pursue their goals of becoming popular artists. \nLive streaming performers include aspiring performers and ordinary people who want to share their music. We also have professional artists perform on our platform to further diversify our content offering and drive user retention. \nWe seek to establish and maintain stable, mutually beneficial relationships with live streaming performers. In particular, as part of our content strategies, we nurture promising live streaming performers and help them grow their fan base and make a living from their performances.

In April 2020, we successfully launched Kuwo Changting, our dedicated long-form audio mobile app, and have\nbeen quickly rolling out audio channels and content offerings within QQ Music and Kugou Music. As part of our long-form audio content strategy, in\nMarch 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% equity interest of Shenzhen Lanren, which operates Lazy Audio, a well-established audio platform in\nChina. In April 2021, we integrated Kuwo Changting with Lazy Audio, and re-imaged the brand Lazy Audio (formerly branded as Lanren Changting\nduring the relevant periods). Lazy Audio is designed to cater to avid audio users by providing an immersive and interactive audio experience through\ncomics, surround sound and bullet chats. Since 2021, we have substantially enriched our licensed titles and accelerated our pace in adding podcasts for\ncontent diversification. For example, as NBA China’s official strategic partner, we have cultivated an NBA podcast ecosystem, attracting a broad range\nof sports fans looking for new and creative ways to enjoy sports content. Our heroic fantasy radio drama, Sword Snow Stride, has also become a self-\nproduced content blockbuster.\n\nAs we grow our long-form audio offerings, we have adopted a two-pronged product strategy designed to unlock significant value from both music\nand standalone long-form audio applications. This approach allows us to leverage our massive existing music user base to drive penetration of our long-\nform audio content offerings.\n\nOther Music Services\n\nWe offer other services to drive user traffic, deepen user engagement and increase monetization. Such services primarily include (i) sales of music-\nrelated merchandise, including Kugou headset, smart speakers, WeSing karaoke microphones and Hi-Fi systems, (ii) services that help smart device and\nautomobile makers build and operate their branded music services on their devices and vehicles, and (iii) online music event ticketing services.\n\nIn order to provide users a consistent and cohesive listening experience, we started to forge Internet of Things (IoT) partnerships with leading\nmanufacturers of cars, smart speakers and smart watches in 2019, which will provide further channels for user acquisition. As a new music content\nconsumption channel, IoT enhances our ability to effectively roll out and promote new music content to a wider audience in a broader set of use cases in\nusers’ daily lives, making our services more accessible and more convenient to our users. We also expanded our coverage of a broader set of music\nusage scenarios, integrating with smart speakers, in-car audio systems and TV and making inroad in the public performance market.

Our advanced algorithms improve the accuracy and relevance of our search results. In addition, we have\ndeveloped various user functions including machine-generated playlists and intelligent recommendations of related music content to\ndeliver a quality and fun music discovery experience. We have been continually improving our efficiency in content curation and accuracy\nof smart recommendation by utilizing deep learning and data mining, which has resulted in a substantial increase in average daily streams\nand user engagements for our services. On our music application recommendation pages, we added live streaming feeds, long-form audio\nand content in other formats, providing more choices to satisfy the entertainment consumption demand of our users. This self-reinforcing\nand virtual process has led to a sequential increase in the proportion of streaming volume driven by recommendation.

After giving effect to the waiver from Spotify and Tencent to receive such share dividend, we distributed to our then existing shareholders (other than Min River Investment Limited and Spotify AB) a share dividend of a total of 88,726,036 of our ordinary shares. Subsequently, in consideration for the above-mentioned waiver from Tencent, a certain number of the ordinary shares of Spotify that we acquired in the foregoing transactions were transferred to a wholly owned subsidiary of Tencent for a nominal consideration of US\\$1, which was accounted for as a distribution to Tencent and recognized in equity. \nWe are a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. We rely principally on dividends from our PRC subsidiaries for our cash requirements, including any payment of dividends to our shareholders. PRC regulations may restrict the ability of our PRC subsidiaries to pay dividends to us. See “Item 3. Key Information—3.D.

Because\nthe treatment of our contractual arrangements with the VIEs is not entirely clear, because we hold a substantial amount of cash, and because our PFIC\nstatus for any taxable year will depend on the composition of our income and assets and the value of our assets from time to time (which may be\ndetermined, in part, by reference to the market price of the ADSs, which could be volatile), there can be no assurance that we will not be a PFIC for any\ntaxable year.\n\nIf we were a PFIC for any taxable year and any of our subsidiaries, VIEs or other companies in which we own or are treated as owning equity\ninterests were also a PFIC (any such entity, a “Lower-tier PFIC”), U.S. Holders would be deemed to own a proportionate amount (by value) of the\nshares of each Lower-tier PFIC and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax according to the rules described in the subsequent paragraph on\n(i) certain distributions by a Lower-tier PFIC and (ii) dispositions of shares of Lower-tier PFICs, in each case as if the U.S. Holders held such shares\ndirectly, even though the U.S. Holders did not receive the proceeds of those distributions or dispositions.\n\nIn general, if we were a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder holds ADSs or Class A ordinary shares, gain recognized by such\nU.S. Holder on a sale or other disposition (including certain pledges) of its ADSs or Class A ordinary shares would be allocated ratably over that U.S.\nHolder’s holding period. The amounts allocated to the taxable year of the sale or disposition and to any year before we became a PFIC would be taxed\nas ordinary income. The amount allocated to each other taxable year would be subject to tax at the highest rate in effect for individuals or corporations,\nas appropriate, for that taxable year, and an interest charge would be imposed on the resulting tax liability for each such year. Furthermore, to the extent\nthat distributions received by a U.S. Holder in any year on its ADSs or Class A ordinary shares exceed 125% of the average of the annual distributions\non the ADSs or Class A ordinary shares received during the preceding three years or the U.S. Holder’s holding period, whichever is shorter, such\ndistributions would be subject to taxation in the same manner.

However, a U.S. Holder may be able to elect to treat the gain as foreign-source income under the Treaty and claim foreign tax credit in respect of any PRC tax on dispositions. The Foreign Tax Credit Regulations generally preclude a U.S. Holder from claiming a foreign tax credit with respect to PRC income taxes on gains from dispositions of ADSs or Class A ordinary shares if the U.S. Holder does not elect to apply the benefits of the Treaty. However, in that case it is possible that any PRC taxes on disposition gains may either be deductible or reduce the amount realized on the disposition. The rules governing foreign tax credits and deductibility of foreign taxes are complex. U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding the consequences of the imposition of any PRC tax on disposition gains, including the Treaty’s resourcing rule, any reporting requirements with respect to a Treaty-based return position and the creditability or deductibility of the PRC tax in their particular circumstances (including any applicable limitations). \nPassive Foreign Investment Company Rules \nIn general, a non-U.S. corporation is a PFIC for any taxable year in which (i)  $75\\%$   or more of its gross income consists of passive income or (ii)  $50\\%$   or more of the average quarterly value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.

Our registered office in the Cayman Islands is located at the office of Maples Corporate Services Limited, PO Box 309, Ugland\nHouse, Grand Cayman, KY1-1104, Cayman Islands. The Company is controlled by Tencent Holdings Limited (“Tencent”), a company\nincorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability and the shares of Tencent are listed on the Main Board of The Stock Exchange of Hong\nKong Limited. The Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since December 12,\n2018. Each ADS of the Company represents two ordinary shares.\n\nThe Company, its subsidiaries, its controlled structured entities (“Variable interest entities”, or “VIE”) and their subsidiaries (“Subsidiaries of\nVIEs”) are collectively referred to as the “Group”. The Group is principally engaged in operating online music entertainment platforms to provide\nmusic streaming, online karaoke and live streaming services in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The Company does not conduct any\nsubstantive operations of its own but conducts its primary business operations through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, VIEs and subsidiaries of\nVIEs in the PRC.\n\nIn July 2016, Tencent acquired control of the Company through a series of transactions, pursuant to which Tencent injected substantially all of its\nonline music business in the mainland China (“Tencent Music Business”) into the Company in exchange for certain number of shares issued by\nthe Company (“Merger”).

Hence, the Group has only one operating segment. In addition, the Group does not\ndistinguish between markets or segments for the purpose of internal reporting.
