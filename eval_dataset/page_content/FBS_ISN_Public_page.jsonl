The regimes promote  implementation of Catch-all and Intangible Technology Transfer (ITT) controls to prevent  transfers of uncontrolled emerging technology items to support the development or  enhancement of military capabilities of U.S. strategic rivals. We also work with the  regimes to broaden their impact beyond the participating governments, for example, by  conducting regular outreach with non-members, industries and academia. ISN will  continue to lead U.S. engagement with partners to coordinate their national export  controls through multilateral export control regimes to stem proliferation of chemical,  biological, nuclear, missile, and advanced conventional weapons goods and  technologies. Through technical and policy consultations with regime members, ISN will  promote transparency and responsibility in transfers of these and related dual-use items  to support regional and international security and stability.  \n•   Bureau Objective 4.3 Risk Considerations:    Failure to ensure the    continued effectiveness and viability of the multilateral export control regimes would  undermine U.S. and international efforts to ensure countries can regulate their own  \nApproved: February 2, 2022  "}
