Similarly, shutdown or blockage of pipelines moving offshore gas can result in curtailment or shut-in of offshore crude production. Because we do not own these third-party pipelines, production platforms, refineries, caverns or facilities, their continuing operation is not within our control.

As with the corporate income tax rate reduction, FERC also has announced that it would take the MLP income tax allowance elimination into account in the next five-year review of indexed rates in 2020. Both of these factors were considered as part of the order on the five-year review that was issued on December 17, 2020, although FERC declined in that order to incorporate the effect of the income tax allowance elimination in setting the new indexing adjustment.

For our FERC-regulated rates charged through our interstate crude oil and liquids pipelines, the rates are based on either a negotiated or market-based rate and are not set through cost-of-service ratemaking subject to FERC’s approval, which are below the cost-of-service rates established by FERC.

Identifying and executing acquisitions is a key part of our strategy. However, if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or if we incur a substantial amount of debt in connection with the acquisitions, our future growth will be limited, and the acquisitions we do make may reduce, rather than increase, our available cash. Our ability to obtain financing or access capital markets may also directly impact our ability to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions.

The discounted cash flow fair value estimate is based on known and knowable information at the measurement date. The significant assumptions that were used to develop the estimate of fair value under the discounted cash flow method include management's best estimates of the expected future cash flows, including prices and volumes, the weighted average cost of capital and the long-term growth rate. If the discount rate was increased by  $1\\%$  , the concluded fair value would decrease by  $\\S5$   million and would remain in excess of carrying value. If the long-term growth rate was decreased by  $1\\%$  , the concluded fair value would decrease by   $\\S4$   million and would remain in excess of carrying value. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that actual amounts will not vary significantly from estimated amounts.

If the assets are not recoverable, we determine the amount of the impairment recognized in the financial statements by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
