This objective supports JSP Objective 4.2,  and the goals outlined in the Department of State’s Enterprise Data   Strategy. It   is not   enough to simply require evidence collection and support sound data management  processes. It is imperative to ensure these efforts result in useful analytic products and  data that can inform foreign assistance decision making. Objective 4.3 builds  sequentially from the improved data quality and availability achieved through  Objectives 4.1 and 4.2 by putting data to use in decision making processes. Sub- objective 4.3.1 leverages insights gained from implementation of the Evidence Act,  including the Learning Agenda and Capacity Assessment, to identify challenges and     best practices for using data and evidence across the department. These lessons and  recommendations will feed into the development of practical guidance and tools for  staff to integrate data, evidence, and learning at different points in foreign assistance  planning and implementation including budget formulation and execution, operational  planning, and strategy processes (sub-objective 4.3.2).
