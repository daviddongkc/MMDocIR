This\nmutation is found in approximately\n13% of patients with non-small cell\nung cancer, which is the most common\norm of lung cancer. The KRAS®2°\nprotein was long considered an\n“undruggable” target. Amgen scientists\nwere the first to identify a previously\nhidden crevice on the surface of the\nKRAS®'¢ protein. Our scientists then\nengineered a molecule—sotorasib—\nhat could attach to the protein.\n\nWe have moved sotorasib forward with\n\nunprecedented speed, filing it for approval\n\nin the U.S. and the European Union just\n28 months after the first patient was\ndosed in a Phase 1 clinical tria—making\nit among the fastest drug development\nprograms in history. What’s especially\nremarkable is that during the last 10 of\nhese 28 months, everyone involved with\nhis program—Amgen staff, clinical trial\ninvestigators, and, of course, patients—\nhad to deal with the complications\npresented by the pandemic.\n\nnthe U.S., sotorasib has received\nPriority Review designation from the\nFDA and is being evaluated under the\nagency’s Real Time Oncology Review\nprogram, which aims to create a\nmore efficient review process so that\nimportant new treatments are made\n\navailable to patients as early as possible.\nAdditionally, as of March 1, we have\nfiled sotorasib for approval as a non-\nsmall cell lung cancer treatment in\nAustralia, Brazil, Canada, and the UK.\n\nWe are also studying sotorasib in\ncombination with other cancer therapies\nand in other solid tumor types.

Unlike existing\nreatments, tezepelumab targets a\nprotein that sits at the top of multiple\ninflammatory cascades and is critical in\nhe initiation and persistence of airway\nnflammation associated with severe\nasthma. The prevalence of severe\nasthma is expected to grow over time as\n\n°\n\nmillions of people around the world move\nfrom rural to urban areas, where the\nair quality is typically poorer. We expect\nto submit tezepelumab for regulatory\napproval in the U.S. and Europe in\nthe first half of this year.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd.or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against CoviD-19),the integration of Otezla?

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this communication and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as aresult of newinformation,futureevents orotherwise. \nNo forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally,clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products,sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with ourproducts, including our devices, after they are onthe market. Our businessmaybe impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims.In addition,our business maybe impactedbythe adoption of new tax legislation orexposure to additional taxliabilities. If wefail tomeet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and theU.S.government,we could become subject to significant sanctions.Further,while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology,the protection offered by our patents and patent applications maybe challenged,invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development.An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat,suchasCoViD-19,and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development,productsales,business and results of operations.Were lyon collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products.Inaddition,we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products.Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product willbe successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us.The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired,may not be successful.Abreakdown,cyber attack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our systems andourdata.Our stock price is volatile and maybe affected by a numberofevents.Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business.Our business performance could affect orlimitthe ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. "}

(including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is committed to\nunlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and\ndelivering innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like advanced human genetics to unravel the\ncomplexities of disease and understand the fundamentals of human biology.\n\nAmgen focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to strive for solutions that improve health\noutcomes and dramatically improve people’s lives. A biotechnology pioneer, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s\nleading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline\nof medicines with breakaway potential.\n\nAmgen was incorporated in California in 1980 and became a Delaware corporation in 1987. We have a presence in\napproximately 100 countries worldwide. Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics.\n\nSignificant Developments\n\nFollowing is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported\nsince the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n\nA novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing coronavirus\ndisease 19, or COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020.\nSince the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021, we have seen some impact of the pandemic to our operations. We\ncontinue to monitor and respond as the pandemic evolves to ensure the continued development, manufacture and distribution of\nour medicines. For further discussion, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations—Overview, Selected Financial Information and Results of Operations. For a discussion of the risks presented by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic to our results, see Risk Factors in Item 1A. Also see the remainder of Item 1.

Data from 59 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were\nalso featured in an oral presentation at a September 2020 medical conference. In the patients with advanced NSCLC\nwho were treated with the 960 mg daily dose, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 35.3%. Across all dose\nlevels, the confirmed ORR was 32.2%, with median duration of response of 10.9 months and median progression-free\nsurvival (PFS) of 6.3 months; 10 of 19 responders were still in response as of the data cutoff.\n\n* In October 2020, we announced top-line phase 2 results in 126 patients with KRAS G/2C-mutant advanced NSCLC.\nSotorasib demonstrated an ORR (primary endpoint) consistent with previously reported phase | data in patients taking\nthe 960 mg daily dose. Other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, were promising, and more than half\nof the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date. The results of this phase\n2 study are potentially registrational, and a phase 3 confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel is currently\nrecruiting patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC.\n", "vlm_text": "PARTI \nItem 1.

{"page": 25, "image_path": "doc_images/NASDAQ_AMGN_2020_25.jpg", "ocr_text": "In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)\nare reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs\nsuch as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and\nPBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain\ngovernment programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under\nthe federal 340B Drug Pricing Program.\n\nBoth private and government payers use formularies to manage access and utilization of drugs. A drug’s inclusion and\nfavorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is\navailable, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and\ncontainment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to\npatients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance\nobligations, limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through\nco-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get\naccess to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion,\nwhich effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of\nsuch measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales.\nFurthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and\ninsurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater\nmarket power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in\nfavor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL,\nOtezla®, Repatha® and Aimovig\", PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from\nmanufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position.\n\nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers from both of the\nmajor U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including\nallowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting international reference pricing (IRP) schemes, which would\nset the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; establishing caps on price increases based on inflation\nmetrics; increasing transparency on drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of\nsuch policies include the previous Administration’s November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute most favored\nnation (MFN) IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of these rules are being\nchallenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented. The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear\nat this time.\n\nIn many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs\nand biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments\nand payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include\nmandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic\nsubstitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology\nassessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and\nreimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many\ncountries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit\nutilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and\nbiologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative\ntherapies and/or allow access to new technologies.\n\n11\n", "vlm_text": "In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get accesstoadrug,higher-tier formula ry placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formula ry exclusion which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay  $100\\%$  of the cost of a drug.The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL Otezla?, Repatha? and Aimovig?, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position. \nIn addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers from both of the major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting international reference pricing (IRP) schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics; increasing transparency on drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of such policies include the previous Administration's November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute most favored nation (MFN) IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of these rules are being challenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented. The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear atthistime. \nIn many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. "}

Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and\nfailure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long—approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to\nmarket. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy\nfor use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk—benefit profile. We continue to work toward\nreducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology, clinical trials and real-world\nevidence.\n\nAfter laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with\nthe FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program.\n\n* In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a\nsmall number of human subjects.\n\n* In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a\npatient population larger than phase | but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study.\n\n* In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates,\ncompared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study.\n\nThe FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend\nor terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk—benefit assessment with regard to the\npatients enrolled in the trial.

We are not permitted to market or\npromote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application.\n\nApproval of Biosimilars. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate,\nabbreviated pathway.

The relevance of demonstrating\n“similarity” is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials\ntypically required of originators, because risk—benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future\ninnovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators’ products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from\ngaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator’s data in their application to the FDA for 12\nyears after initial FDA approval of the originator product.

{"page": 29, "image_path": "doc_images/NASDAQ_AMGN_2020_29.jpg", "ocr_text": "Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and\nprocesses used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving\napproval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory\nreview may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific\nregulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to\nreinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval.\n\nRegulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or\nmore regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own\nregulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products\nmeet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates\nwill be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well.\n\nRegulation outside the United States\n\nIn European Union (EU) countries as well as in Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and\napproval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States.\n\nIn the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU\nmember state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for\nmarketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one\nmember state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and\napproved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states\nfrom which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of\nsingle national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from\nbiotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its\nscientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the\nEMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the\nEuropean Commission (EC) for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally\nfollows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country\nreimbursement approval.\n\nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway,\nan applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference\nproduct has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the\nbiosimilar is “highly similar” in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the\nEuropean Economic Area.\n\nAs a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, the EMA in March 2019 relocated to Amsterdam. The\nUnited Kingdom officially left the EU in January 2020, and in December 2020, a new trade deal was agreed that starts to clarify\nhow U.K. medicines will be independently supervised and where continued collaborations and recognitions can be expected.\nAmgen continues to monitor future negotiations to ensure no interruption in the supervision, regulation or supply of medicines\nin the United Kingdom and Europe.\n\nOther countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data\nrequirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory\nauthorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug\nproduct upon importation and other domestic requirements.\n\nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data\nfor bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug\ndevelopment and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in\nthe United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, the regulatory timelines can be\nless predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product\nupon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that\nwould allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have\npathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are\nalready present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).\n\n15\n", "vlm_text": "Regulation of Manufacturing Standards.

In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP's opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursementapproval. \nIn the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. \nAs a result of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the EU, the EMA in March 2019 relocated to Amsterdam. The United Kingdom officially left the EU in January 2020, and in December 2020, a new trade deal was agreed that starts to clarify how U.K. medicines will be independently supervised and where continued collaborations and recognitions can be expected. Amgen continues to monitor future negotiations to ensure no interruption in the supervision, regulation or supply of medicines in the UnitedKingdom and Europe. \nOther countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. \nIn Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea).

Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement, but in each year are at least  $90\\%$  .The agreement expires in 2022.The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by theotherparty. \nFor financial information concerning our significant collaborative arrangements, see Part IV—Note 8, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nHuman Capital Resources \nAmgen's approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to serve patients. Our industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, require talent that is highly educated and/or has significant industry experience. Additionally, for certain key functions, we require specific scientific expertise to oversee and conduct R&D activities and the complex manufacturing requirements for bio pharmaceutical products. \nAs of December 31, 2020, Amgen had approximately 24,300 staff members, and we have had relatively low global turnover rates. We consider our staff relations to be good; supported by our regular staff engagement assessments, with surveys on a wide range of topics (including engagement in the COVID-19 environment, diversity, inclusion and belonging and ethics). We discuss theresults of these surveys with our Board of Directors. \nCompensation,Benefits and Development \nOur approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash,equity and benefit programs that are competitivewith those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract,motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Company'sshareholders. \nOur base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company.

See Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Our business\nhas been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. Since late 2018,\nCongressional focus on drug pricing has increased, placing our industry under greater Congressional scrutiny. For example, in\nearly 2019, the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical\nmanufacturers, including Amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies’ drug pricing practices.\nSubsequently, in the fall of 2020, the House Oversight and Reform Committee released staff reports and held hearings with\nexecutives from six biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, about their companies’ drug pricing practices. Also,\nbetween 2019 and 2020, a number of other Congressional committees held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on\ndrug-pricing and payment policy. For example, in 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other\nthings, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and/or D faster than the\nrate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and require higher/additional manufacturer\ndiscounts in Medicare Part D. Additionally, in late 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives,\nwhich would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the\nmaximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index), includes a penalty for failing to reach\nagreement with the government, and requires that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. We expect H.R.\n3, or some similar proposed legislation, to be debated by Congress this year. Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have\nbeen introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part,\ncould also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription\nmedications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing. Further, in\nmid-2020, the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of biopharmaceuticals\nfor patients, including a MFN policy for Medicare Parts B and D, under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement\npayment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for\ncertain Part B and Part D medicines. In September 2020, in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released a\nfinal rule to allow states (or other nonfederal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation\nof certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada. Currently, the rule is being challenged by litigation, however, should\nsuch litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation, this rule could allow\nthe importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen’s products (including Otezla®), that could have a material adverse\neffect on Amgen’s business. Further, in November 2020, also in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released\nan interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach. If implemented, the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate\nfor 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia®, XGEVA®, KYPROLIS®, Neulasta®, Nplate”,\nEPOGEN® and Aranesp\") equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) nations. Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation\nof this MFN rule based on, among other things, procedural defects. Late in 2020, in the case filed by the Biotechnology\nIndustry Organization and others, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction\npreventing the rule from taking effect nationwide, pending the government’s completion of required administrative procedures.\nThe case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23, 2021.\nAnother case, filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the U.S. District Court for the\nDistrict of Maryland, was also stayed. Notwithstanding these stays, the MFN rule’s approach to drug pricing and other similar\napproaches, remain of interest. Further, despite the change in Administration, we expect continued significant focus on\nhealthcare and similar drug pricing proposals, including proposals similar to the MFN rule, for the foreseeable future.\n\nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy\nresulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. For example, the previous Administration released a drug\npricing blueprint in 2018 which introduced an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating\npower of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly\naffect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such policy ideas included, but were not limited to, moving coverage\nand reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B\ndrugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare.\n\n35\n", "vlm_text": "A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments.SeeItem 1.Business—Reimbursement.

Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part could also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing. Further, in mid-2020,the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of bio pharmaceuticals forpatients,including aMF N policy for Medicare Parts Band D,under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement payment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for certain Part B and Part D medicines. In September 2020, in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released a final rule to allow states (or other nonfederal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada. Currently, the rule is being challenged by litigation, however, should such litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation, this rule could allow the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen's products (including Otezla), that could have a material adverse effect on Amgen's business. Further, in November 2020, also in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach. If implemented, the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia?, XGEVA?, KYPROLIS?, Neulasta?, Nplate?,  $\\operatorname{EPOGEN}^{\\mathbb{R}}$   and Aranesp?) equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD) nations. Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation of this MFN rule based on, among other things, procedural defects. Late in 2020, in the case filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization and others, the U.s. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction preventing the rule from taking effect nationwide, pending the government's completion of required administrative procedures. The case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23, 2021. Another case, filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the U.s. District Court for the District of Maryland, was also stayed. Notwithstanding these stays, the MFN rule's approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches, remain of interest. Further, despite the change in Administration, we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals, including proposals similar to the MFN rule, for the foreseeable future. \nOur business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. For example, the previous Administration released a drug pricing blueprint in 2018 which introduced an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such policy ideas included, but were not limited to, moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare.

Our products have\nalso experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that\ncompete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory\napproval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the\nrate of increased competition for our products could accelerate.\n\nIn the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific\nguidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries\nand some Canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician\nprescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU\ncountries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of\ncompetitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of\nbiosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing.\n\nIn the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item\n1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant\ninto the U.S. market was Sandoz’s Zarxio® (filgrastim-sndz), a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in 2015. Since then, the\nFDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, EPOGEN® and ENBREL, and a growing\nnumber of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Four biosimilar\nversions of Neulasta® are now marketed in the United States, and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® to receive\napproval in 2021 and beyond. Impact to our Neulasta® sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item\n1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. An approved biosimilar version of\nEPOGEN* has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of\nthe approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to\ncompete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing\nor a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have\nchallenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For example, we\nrecently successfully defended our ENBREL patents against a litigation challenge. For examples of and information related to\nour biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to\nprevail in current and future intellectual property litigation.\n\nThe U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable\nwith their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain\ninterchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our\nreference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance\nthat provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin\nproducts. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for\ncertain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products.\n\nIn addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten\nthe data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new\nproducts receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-\nCanada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering\nwhether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12-\nyear exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that\numbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period,\nthis could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and\nregulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and\ncommercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that\nmay be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new\nlaws requiring more disclosure in the FDA’s Orange and Purple Books.\n\n42\n", "vlm_text": "We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond.

While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing. \nIn the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market was Sandoz's Zarxio\\* (filgrastim-sndz), a biosimilar version of  $\\mathbf{\\mathrm{NEUIPGED}^{\\mathcal{R}}}$  ,in 2015.Since then,the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta?,  $\\operatorname{EPOGEL}^{\\operatorname{\\mathbb{R}}}$  and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Four biosimilar versions of Neulasta? are now marketed in the United States, and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta? to receive approval in 2021 and beyond. Impact to our Neulasta? sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN? has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For example, we recently successfully defended our ENBREL patents against a litigation challenge. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. \nThe U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products. \nIn addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law's provisions regarding which new products received at a exclusivity.Inlate2Ol9,the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product's original 12- year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity\"). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchange ability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements,implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA's Orange and Purple Books.

The sanctions could include the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’\nrefusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical\ntrials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties\nand/or criminal prosecutions.\n\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming\nand costly.

In the\nUnited States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late\nDecember 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA’s\nactivities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates\nand our product approvals.\n\nRegulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we\nselect for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using\nsurrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a\ntherapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD),\nor to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by\nPFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant\nimprovement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in\noverall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be\nevaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such\nas death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other\nmeasures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically\nsignificant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory\nstudy or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining\napproval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha® reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient\npopulation, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent CV events met certain of\nits primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha” to\nreduce the risk of certain CV events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the\ntreatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the\nefficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing\ntreatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or\nat all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from\nobtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from\nmaintaining our current product labels.\n\n46\n", "vlm_text": "Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication.

Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.

There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities. \nAcquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management's attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges.

Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including\nair and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters,\nsecurity threats and/or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThere have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the\nUnited States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States.

While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in\nthe U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand\nOaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or\nregulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business.\n\nOur operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The\neconomic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended\nduration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost\ncontainment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and\nreimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may\ndelay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients’\nability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay\nor deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and\ncould continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales,\nbusiness and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and\nsuppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements\nwith us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial\ncondition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become\ninsolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant\nworsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us.\n\nWe maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital\nmarkets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained\nor recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by\ninterest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in\nother-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges\nwith respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments.\n\n53\n", "vlm_text": "In addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers.

Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters, security threats and/or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. \nThere have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled “Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.\" Additionally, one legislative proposal would prohibit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.s. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. \nGENERAL RISK FACTORS \nGlobal economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. \nOur operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales. business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors',customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us. \nWe maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. "}

A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology\ncompanies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway\npotential. In 2020, we celebrated our 40\" anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the\npotential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases.\n\nOur principal products—those with the most significant annual commercial sales—are ENBREL, Prolia®, Neulasta®,\nOtezla®, XGEVA®, Aranesp\", KYPROLIS® and Repatha®. We also market a number of other products, including Nplate”,\nVectibix®, MVASI®, Parsabiv®, EPOGEN®, KANJINTI®, BLINCYTO®, Aimovig®, EVENITY®, AMGEVITA™, Sensipar®/\nMimpara”, NEUPOGEN®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor® and AVSOLA®. For additional information about our products, see Part I,\nItem 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products.\n\nOur strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry.\nWe focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and\nneuroscience, and we conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and\nCV/metabolic diseases. In 2020, we advanced our innovative pipeline, successfully integrated Otezla\", acquired in November\n2019, into our inflammation portfolio, advanced our international expansion and continued to provide uninterrupted supply of\nour medicines globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and\ndisciplined approach to capital allocation, and advancing our environmental, social and governance efforts.\n\nDuring the year, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars\nand generics, total product sales increased 9%, driven by volume growth primarily from Otezla®, partially offset by lower net\nselling prices. Product sales increased 9% and 10% in the United States and rest of the world, respectively. Total operating\nexpenses increased 19%, driven by expenses related to Otezla®.\n\nWe continued to advance our pipeline, including sotorasib and tezepelumab—two molecules with respect to which we\nhave achieved positive registration enabling data from our clinical trial activities. We also continued to advance our biosimilar\nprogram with the launch of AVSOLA® and the approval of RIABNI™ in the United States. Our biosimilars are expected to\nlaunch in new markets throughout 2021. Lastly, we broadened our international reach, particularly in the Asia Pacific region\nwith our investment in and strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China, as well as the\nestablishment of our wholly owned affiliate in Japan.\n\nCash flows from operating activities totaled $10.5 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to\nshareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2020, we increased our quarterly cash dividend\nby 10% to $1.60 per share of common stock. In December 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share of common\nstock for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2021. We also repurchased 15.2\nmillion shares of our common stock throughout 2020, at an aggregate cost of $3.5 billion. During the year, we had proceeds\nfrom the issuance of debt of $8.9 billion and repayments of debt of $6.5 billion. In addition, we exchanged some of our higher\ninterest rate debt for newly issued debt with a lower interest rate and a later maturity date.\n\nAmgen’s approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating and\nretaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization\nof innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance,\npromote accountability and adherence to Company values, and in alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.\nFurther, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients.

Nevertheless, given the increased intensity exiting 2020 and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we\nexpect there could be intermittent disruptions in physician—patient interactions going forward, and thus we continue to expect\nquarter-to-quarter variability. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem introduce variability into product sales trends. For example,\nchanges in U.S. employment could lead to changes to the insured population, with growth in Medicaid enrollees and uninsured\nindividuals having a negative impact on revenues.

Increases are attributed to stock-based compensation expenses and issuances of common stock related to equity award programs.\n\n3. **Accumulated Deficit**:\n   - This column details the company's net losses or profits over time, starting at $(5,072) million in 2017 and ending at $(21,408) million in 2020.

Historically, such amounts have represented less than  $1\\%$  of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales. \nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than  $1\\%$  ofgrossproduct sales. Changes in estimatesfor prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial. \nOurpayment terms vary by types andlocations of customers and theproducts or services offered.Paymentterms differby jurisdiction and customer,but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to120days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers. \nIndirect taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities and that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues. \nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. "}

The pool of shares available under the Amended 2o09 Plan is reduced by one share for each stock option granted and by 1.9 shares for other types of awards granted, including RSUs and performance units (full-value awards). In general, if any shares subject to an award granted under the Amended 2oo9 Plan expire or become forfeited, terminated or canceled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to such awards are added backintothe authorized pool on the same basis that theywereremoved.In addition,under the Amended 2 oo 9 Plan,shares withheld to pay for minimum statutory tax obligations with respect to full-value awards are added back into the authorized pool on the basis of 1.9 shares. As of December 31, 2020, the Amended 2009 Plan provides for future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately 23 million shares of our common stock.

Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig™ in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization\ncosts with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-\ndevelopment rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig®. Novartis pays Amgen\ndouble-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the Novartis exclusive territories and funds a portion of global R&D\nexpenses.

Collaborations \nA collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity. Such arrangements involve two or more parties that are both (i) active participants in the activity and (ii) exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. \nFrom time to time, we enter into collaborative arrangements for the R&D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. These collaborations generally provide for nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration arrangements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each arrangement is unique in nature. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, for additional discussion of revenues recognized for these types of arrangements. Operating expenses for costs incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their respective expense line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Our significant arrangements are discussed below. \nBeiGene,Ltd. \nOn January 2, 2020, we acquired a  $20.5\\%$  stake in BeiGene, Ltd.

Upon  regulatory  approval,  BeiGene  will  assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside of China, Amgen will also pay BeiGene royalties. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net costs recovered from BeiGene for oncology product candidates were \\$225 million and were recorded as an offset to R&D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGe ne by approximately  $\\S2.4$  billion. This investment is accounted for by using the equity method of accounting, which requires us to identify and allocate amounts to the items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years. \nDuring the year ended December 31,2020, we recognized an increase in the carrying value of our investment by purchasing additional shares to maintain our ownership interest for an aggregate cost of  $\\S569$  million and recognized  $\\S34$  million for the impact of other BeiGene ownership transactions.

Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on\nmarket data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s\nassumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on the\nbest information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is divided into three levels based on the source of\ninputs as follows:\n\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company\nhas the ability to access\n\nLevel 2 — Valuations for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly—other than Level | inputs\n\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement\n\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities. To the extent that\nthe valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value\nrequires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used for measuring fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value\nhierarchy.
