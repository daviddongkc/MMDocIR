Losses are deductible following a  Finnish Supreme Court decision in 2019. According to its guidance on taxation of  virtual currencies, cryptoassets created through hard forks are not taxed at the time of  creation but at the time of transfer. Thus, a forked cryptocurrency asset is valued at zero  until it is transferred (sold or exchanged). The Finnish Tax Authority has not issued  specific guidance for the taxation of airdrops. Depending on whether airdrops are  considered most similar to a mined asset, a staked or forked asset, or a gift, such assets  may be taxed as income either from a hobby or from capital gain, or not taxed, as the  receipt of gifts are not taxed in Finland.
