(“the Parent”) and its\nsubsidiaries (“the Group”), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 January 2022, and the\nconsolidated statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement\nof changes in equity, consolidated statement of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements for the\nyear then ended (“2021”).\n\nIn our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the\nconsolidated equity and consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 January 2022, and its consolidated\nresults and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting\nStandards as adopted by the European Union (EU-IFRSs) and the other provisions of the regulatory financial reporting\nframework applicable to the Group in Spain.\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the audit regulations in force in Spain.

The conflict has prevented the ordinary course of operations throughout the region.  \nIn this regard, on 5 March 2022, the Group announced that under the current circumstances it could  not guarantee the continuity of the operations and commercial conditions in the Russian Federation and  temporarily suspended its activity there (this applies to physical stores and the online channel alike).  It  had halted its operations in Ukraine on 24 February 2022.  \nIn both markets, all the stores (502 in Russia and 84 in Ukraine) are operated under lease, so the value  of the Group’s net assets in the two markets at 2021 year-end was not material from the perspective of  the consolidated financial statements for that year. As these circumstances occurred subsequent to the  close of the financial statements, no provision was allocated in this connection, pursuant to IAS 10.  \nIn the current environment, it is difficult to gauge the possible implications of this situation for the  Inditex Group, based on the multiple potential developments in the short and medium term. Group’s  Management continues to track the unfolding conflict and its potential repercussions closely. The  Group’s businesses in the Russian Federation and Ukraine respectively account for some   $8.5\\%$  and   $1.5\\%$   of its EBIT.    \nInformation on the outlook for the Group  \nInditex continues to see strong growth opportunities.

In 2021 we managed to achieve or even top all of the targets we had set for ourselves.  Most notably,  $9\\varOmega\\%$   of the energy we consumed came from renewable sources, above the target set and  putting us on track to deliver our goal of   $\\bumpeq00\\%$   in 2022. Furthermore,   $47\\%$   of our articles carried our  Join Life label, outperforming our target of   $40\\%$  . The biggest development on the sustainability front  was our decision to bring our target for net zero emission operations – the sustainability goal that  encompasses and drives all others – forward by a whole decade, to 2040.   \nInditex has become an engine for the sustainable transformation of its suppliers. We have worked with  them to become bolder in our ambitions for their transformation. We have moved the target for having  all the cotton and viscose sourced from more sustainable sources forward to 2023, by [the end of] which  we are also planning to reduce the water consumed in our supply chain by   $25\\%$  .   \nAs for plastics, we have pledged to use only polyester from more sustainable sources by 2025 and  agreed with the Ellen McArthur Foundation to halve our virgin plastic footprint by 2025 from a 2019  baseline. Along the way we have eliminated all plastic shopping bags from our stores and started to  charge for paper bags in a number of countries in order to encourage their reduction and reuse. All the  proceeds from their sale are being put back into environmental projects.   \nAll our sustainability initiatives are governed by two basic premises: firstly, it is an effort that requires  constant fine-tuning; secondly, it is an effort that must be people-driven. Against that backdrop, we  have reiterated and reinforced our commitment to the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human  Rights. We are also convinced that progress on digitalisation will fuel our sustainability strategy, framed  by our commitment to the United Nations Global Compact, its Guiding Principles and its Sustainable  Development Goals. In keeping with our transparency pledge, over the coming pages we seek to provide  a transparent and detailed account of the progress we have made in all these areas, ensuring the  integrity of the data reported and upholding, in our concluding sections, the principles of the Integrated  Reporting framework.  \nIn tandem with our end-to-end sustainability approach, we remain true to our community investment  strategy. In 2021 that work benefitted more than 2.2 million people through 725 projects and initiatives  carried out together with 427 organisations and charities, to which we committed €63.5 million.   \nLastly, I would like to end this letter by extending my heartfelt thanks to everyone here at Inditex. Today  our team numbers 100,000 more than it did 17 years ago. For my part, it has been the highest honour  imaginable to lead this team of unrivalled individuals and watch you grow. Thank you so much for  everything you do day after day and for the personal and professional relationships we have built. I will  always carry you all in my heart.   \nMany thanks. "}

In addition, through\nour partnerships with Médecins Sans\nFrontiéres, Medicus Mundi and Every\nMother Counts, we have contributed to\nimproving the health and well-being of more\nthan 6 million vulnerable people around\n\nthe world.\n\nops 8\nDECENT WORK AND\nECONOMIC GROWTH\n\nAt Inditex we encourage the creation of stimulating,\nstable and safe working environments in which\n\nall the people who make up our value chain have\nequal opportunities and where their professional\ndevelopment is boosted. In this regard, the\ninitiatives aimed at our people are of great\nimportance, but also our Workers at the Centre\n2019-2022 strategy, aimed at supply chain workers,\nthrough which in 2021 we reached 1,366,420\nworkers. We collaborate with various organisations\n‘to achieve this goal, including IndustriALL Global\nUnion, UNI Global Union or the International\n\nLabour Organization. As part of our investment in\nthe community, we promote the employment of\npeople at risk or in a situation of social exclusion\n‘through initiatives such as for&from, SALTA or the\nemployment programme with Caritas.\n\nrose\n\n2S\n\nco\n\nSDG12\nRESPONSIBLE CONSUMPTION\nAND PRODUCTION\n\nSustainability, as an integrated aspect of our\nbusiness model, implies promoting responsible\n‘consumption and production practices. We\n‘conduct numerous social and environmental\nactions that take into account the entire life cycle\nof our products. Thus, in 2021 we continued to\npromote the production of articles labelled under\n‘our Join Life standard, which identifies articles\nmade of the most sustainable raw materials and\nthe most environmentally friendly production\nprocesses - reaching 47% of items placed on\n\nthe market under this standard. As part of our\n‘community investment, we are developing\nprojects such as Moda Re- and partnerships\nsuch as the one initiated in 2020 with UNHCR,\nwith the aim of extending the life cycle of text\nproducts and reducing the generation of waste.\n\nSUSTAINABLE\n\nSDG13\nCLIMATE\nACTION\n\nWe are strongly committed to fighting\nagainst climate change. In line with\n\n‘our unwavering commitment, we have\nbrought forward our Net Zero Emissions\ngoal to 2040 (previously 2050). We have\nalso been involved in multiple initiatives\nfocused on the fight against climate\nchange, such as Race to Zero, within\nthe framework of the United Nations\nFramework Convention on Climate\n‘Change (UNFCCC); the We Mean\nBusiness Coalition; or the Business Call\nfor a UN Treaty on Plastic Pollution.\nAlso notable is our participation in 2021\nin the review of the objectives of the\nFashion Industry Charter for Climate\nAction (FICCA).\n\n-190-\n\ng\n\nSDG5\n\nGENDER EQUALITY\n\nGender equality and women\n‘empowerment are at the very essence\nof Inditex, where women account for\n76% of the workforce. In this regard,\n‘we nurture diverse and inclusive\n‘working environments that guarantee\nfair access to opportunities for\nprofessional development, with wage\nparity between men and women.\nFurthermore, within the framework of\nthe Workers at the Centre 2019-2022\nstrategy, we implement numerous\ninitiatives to protect and empower\nwomen in our supply chain, Promoting\n‘womenis empowerment is also a key\npillar of our community investment\nprogramme, through partnerships with\n‘organisations such as Every Mother\nCounts, Waterorg and Medicus Mundi\n\nSDG17\nPARTNERSHIPS\nFOR THE GOALS\n\nAt Inditex we believe partnerships\narea fundamental tool for achieving\nthe Sustainable Development.\n\nGoals and generating 2 lasting\nimpact on communities and the\nindustry. That is why our initiatives\n‘always involve a significant\n‘component of collaboration, be it\nwith organisations like the United\nNations Global Compact, the\nIntemational Labour Organization,\nIndustriALL Global Union, Médecins\n‘Sans Frontiéres, or through industry\npartnerships as in the Fashion\n\nPact, Make Fashion Circular,\n\n‘or ACT (Action, Collaboration,\nTransformation).\n\npe\nhtt\n\nOTHER NOTABLE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nThis year we joined Alianza Pais Pobreza Infantil Cero (Country\nPartnership for Zero Child Poverty), an initiative by the Spanish\nGovernment's High Commissioner against Child Poverty. In addition to this\ninitiative, we have continued our work in projects with different non-profit\n‘organisations such as Entreculturas. As a result of this alliance, more than\n1.3 million vulnerable people in 27 countries have had access to more and\nbetter opportunities to transform their lives and their environment.\n\nThis year we have worked very closely with a number of entities such as\nthe Spanish Federation of Food Banks (Spain), La Mie de Pain (France)\n‘ Entreculturas (Paraguay) on 9 projects focused on the eradication of\nhunger as part of our community investment programme.\n\nAt Inditex we promote the professional development of our employees\nthrough training and intemal promotion. In 2021, 50% of the Groups\nvacancies were filled internally. We have also continued our efforts\nwith NGOs that promote access to primary and secondary education,\nsuch as Entreculturas, as well as university education in collaboration\nwith entities such as Tsinghua University, University of Dhaka or\nUniversidade da Coruiia, among others.\n\nIn 2021 we committed to a 25% reduction in water consumption\nin our supply chain by 2025. We also continue to collaborate with\n‘organisations such as Water.org to improve access to drinking water\nand sanitation in several countries. As a result, more than 2.3 milion\npeople in Bangladesh, India and Cambodia have improved their access\n‘to water and sanitation.\n\nThis year we have ramped up our ambition and set the goal of\n‘consuming 100% renewable energy in our facilities by 2022. In 2021,\nwe have achieved 91% of energy consumption in our facilities from\nrenewable sources, avoiding the emission of 493,723 tonnes of\n‘greenhouse gases.\n\nOver the course of 2021, we commenced a number of innovation\nprojects in various areas of our value chain, Boston Consulting Group\nincluded us in their ranking of Most innovative Companies 2021.\n\nJn2021 we broadened our collaboration with UNHCR to help refugees.\nFurthermore, we have promoted numerous community investment\nprogrammes to reduce inequalities, investing a total of 19.9 milion euros\nin 2021 to initiatives linked to SDG 10.\n\nThroughout 2021 we have developed 18 projects, in collaboration with\n‘organisations such as Teatro Real and Museo Nacional de Arte Reina\nSofia (Spain), Fundago de Serralves (Portugal) or US Green Building\nCouncil (United States) that contribute to this objective.\n\nThis year Inditex joined the Board of the ZDHC (Zero Discharge of\nHazardous Chemicals), with whom we have been working for some\ntime and whose objective is to achieve zero discharge of hazardous\nchemicals in the textile industry. Consistent with this goal, we invest in\nprogrammes aimed at protecting aquatic life.\n\nIn 2021 we joined the LEAF coalition, which focuses on protecting tropical\nforests. We also continued our commitment to preserve ecosystems\nthrough a number of projects and by consuming raw materials from\nmore sustainable sources, which account already for a 42% of the total.\n\nInditex has a robust corporate governance and compliance system\naimed at showing our firm commitment to good governance and social\nand environmental sustainability, and conveying that corporate ethical\nculture to all our stakeholders.\n\n", "vlm_text": "\n\nThe image is a graphical representation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Accordingly,  incident management uses a parametrised traffic light system incorporating automatisms to swiftly identify  and resolve incidents based on their criticality. It also affords us the capacity to anticipate incidents in certain  assets; in other words, predictive maintenance.  "}

The Company is among the European leaders  in promoting diversity, according to the Financial Times ranking, which evaluates the performance of more than  850 companies across 16 countries, chosen from among more than 15,000 companies throughout Europe.  Inditex also further cemented its place in 2021 among the 100 leading companies in the promotion of diversity and  inclusion at the global level, as ranked by Refinitiv. This index transparently and objectively measures the data from  around 11,000 worldwide companies, representing more than  $80\\%$   of global market capitalisation, using 24 metrics  across four key pillars: Diversity, Inclusion, People Development and News and Controversies.  At Inditex, we believe the power of creating a diverse and inclusive culture lies in our people. In a  markedly international company, the D&I project was devised from a global perspective, and is  implemented in all our markets, which are a source of diversity and multiculturalism.  In this context, in order to reinforce our own employees as the conveyors of our values of inclusion and respect,  since 2018 we have appointed Diversity Champions among our staff in the various subsidiaries. Their mission  \nis to act as ambassadors of diversity and inclusion in their countries and workplaces to contribute with ideas  and projects that enrich our inclusive culture. At present, there are more than 40 Champions. Further  cementing their collaborative efforts, the community of Champions in Europe was awarded the Holistic  Diversity Management certificate by the ENAR Foundation, awarded for the first time to a European company.  \nIn 2021 our subsidiaries in Greece, Portugal, Poland and Bulgaria, as well as the office of our subsidiary  in Belgium, signed up to the Diversity Charter, a European Commission equality initiative that has been  adhered to by other eight subsidiaries in Europe (France, Germany, Croatia, Romania, Slovenia, Italy,  the Netherlands and Sweden).

This programme,  launched in 2021, is conducted in conjunction with local organisations such as Prodis and COGAMI that work  to foster the inclusion in the workplace of people with different talents.  The programme is based on adapting  the job position and functions to the abilities of the participants, providing on-site support from NGOs and  tutors from Inditex and implementing inclusion activities with participants and tutors. Through the INCLUYE  initiative, 20 people with intellectual disabilities have joined Zara’s Logistics Platforms in Arteixo (A Coruña),  Zaragoza and Meco (Madrid).  \nFurthermore, we should also highlight our for&from project, which consists of the creation of a network  of social franchises from our different concepts, managed by non-profit organisations and staffed by  people with disabilities. This initiative currently has 15 stores generating more than 200 jobs for people  with various kinds of disability. All profits generated by for&from stores are reinvested in social projects  run by the partner organisations.  \n5.1.1.3.3.   Inclusion of the LGTB  $^+$   community  \nTo stop discrimination against people belonging to the LGTB  $^+$   community in the workplace, in 2018 we  signed up to the UN LGTBI Standards of Conduct, based on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and  Human Rights, and including contributions from hundreds of companies from a range of sectors.  \nSince 2016 we have been a member of Open for Business, a coalition of leading global companies that  advocate for the rights and inclusion of the LGTB  $^+$   community. From this forum we endeavour to show  that more inclusive societies are better for businesses. We also contend that enterprises that promote  the inclusion of the LGTB  $^+$   community are more dynamic, productive and innovative.  \nIn Spain, Inditex joined REDI (Red Empresarial de Diversidad e Inclusión LGTB+, Business Network for   $\\mathsf{L G T B+}$   Diversity and Inclusion) in 2018. This network fosters an inclusive environment in organisations  and seeks to eradicate stereotypes. The aim is to value employees’ talents regardless of their gender  identity, gender expression and sexual orientation.  \nOnce again in 2021 various Inditex subsidiaries in Europe and North America took part in the   $\\mathsf{L G T B+}$    Pride celebrations in June and July, through a range of actions that included courses in LGTB  $^+$  inclusion  in Germany, all stores’ involvement in an inclusive competition to develop the Love&Pride initiative in  Italy, or collaboration with the solidarity festival Solidays in France.  \nThis year a number of projects have been launched to help transgender and non-binary people access  employment. In Spain, the SALTA project involved initiatives to include trans people in our store and  logistics teams thanks to the collaboration with entities like Fundación 26 Diciembre. And in the United  States we launched the IN Pride project aimed at creating job opportunities at our stores in conjunction  with two New York organisations: The Door and The Ali Forney Center.   \nIn addition, our US subsidiary has been named one of the ‘Best Places to Work’ for LGTB  $^+$  people in the  Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index 2022, recognising those companies  that implemented the best LGTB  $^+$   inclusion practices in 2021. Zara USA obtained the top score (100  out of 100 points) in the support and empowerment of our LGTB  $^+$   people and in promoting inclusive  workplaces for all.  "}

Throughout this year we have continued with the virtual training  programmes we launched last year. In 2021, we launched HR Virtual Training, a specialisation  itinerary designed to keep Human Resources staff abreast of the latest trends in people  management. In the first module, known as Core, 10 talks were given to 2,814 recipients in 40  countries. The second part, a specialisation track, tackles topics such as leadership,  management, well-being and big data, and was followed by 350 people.   \n5.1.2.4. Connection and engagement with our people  \nThe fourth pillar of our talent management strategy is to provide an enriching work environment with  attractive conditions that help us retain talent, connect with our people and enhance their engagement.  In this regard, INET, our internal communication application, performs an essential role in how we  connect with our staff.   \nPresent both in app and online format in all our markets with employees, it recorded more than 21  million accesses in 2021 (more than 19 million in 2020). Furthermore, we have fully revamped its  design this year, offering our users a more intuitive and simplified browsing experience. INET enables  us to digitalise all communication in the markets where we are present with our people, continually  incorporating new features and staying permanently connected.  "}

Accordingly, we strive to ensure that the remuneration standard is adapted to\nthe local reality of each market, establishing remuneration according to the reference practices of each\nof these markets in local currency.\n\nThe remuneration policy at Inditex guarantees non-discrimination by reason of sex, age, culture,\nreligion or ethnicity or any other circumstance. In this regard, the team of professionals at Inditex are\nremunerated according to their professional skills, experience, dedication and responsibility\nundertaken. Inditex's remuneration comprises a fixed component and a variable component.\n\nExperience, personal contribution to the work, and responsibility within the organisation determine the\nfixed remuneration. Variable remuneration depends fully on predefined, quantifiable and measurable\nindicators, all linked to the Company’s results. Based on this criterion, variable remuneration does not\ndepend on a discretionary assessment of a person’s individual performance, but is based solely on\nobjective parameters. The purpose is to guarantee non-discrimination. In this regard, variable\nremuneration is one of the key components of Inditex’s remuneration policy and applies to employees\nin all areas of the Company’s activity. We encourage decision-making and initiative at all levels, and we\nreward people in proportion to the responsibility assumed.\n\nIn stores, our most widely used variable remuneration system is that of the monthly sales commission\nscheme. This is a way to reward the engagement of store employees in such key issues as sales results,\nfeedback on products and store coordination and organisation.

Accordingly, we strive to ensure that the remuneration standard is adapted to  the local reality of each market, establishing remuneration according to the reference practices of each  of these markets in local currency.  \nThe remuneration policy at Inditex guarantees non-discrimination by reason of sex, age, culture,  religion or ethnicity or any other circumstance. In this regard, the team of professionals at Inditex are  remunerated according to their professional skills, experience, dedication and responsibility  undertaken. Inditex's remuneration comprises a fixed component and a variable component.  \nExperience, personal contribution to the work, and responsibility within the organisation determine the  fixed remuneration. Variable remuneration depends fully on predefined, quantifiable and measurable  indicators, all linked to the Company’s results. Based on this criterion, variable remuneration does not  depend on a discretionary assessment of a person’s individual performance, but is based solely on  objective parameters. The purpose is to guarantee non-discrimination. In this regard, variable  remuneration is one of the key components of Inditex’s remuneration policy and applies to employees  in all areas of the Company’s activity. We encourage decision-making and initiative at all levels, and we  reward people in proportion to the responsibility assumed.   \nIn stores, our most widely used variable remuneration system is that of the monthly sales commission  scheme. This is a way to reward the engagement of store employees in such key issues as sales results,  feedback on products and store coordination and organisation. Over the last few years, we have started  implementing a new system of in-store variable remuneration with a special focus on transparency and  simplicity and taking into account the changing environment.   \nMoreover, true to our values of transparency and results orientation, in 2020 we aligned the Group's  sustainability objectives with those of the office staff in terms of remuneration. Accordingly, the  achievement of our sustainability goals is a component of our office employees’ variable remuneration.  This underpins our commitment to our people in this regard, highlighting the fact that our variables are  fully linked to business results. In addition, during 2021, the level of achievement with structural  variables has improved, thus enhancing the recognition of extraordinary results in our employees’  remuneration.  \nGender pay gap  \nTo analyse differences in salaries by gender, the pay gap is the clearest indicator in methodological  terms. The gender pay gap is calculated based upon the median salary in each market (considering total  salary: fixed   $^+$   variable, consisting of commission and bonus), weighted according to each area of  activity of the Group (store, central services, logistics and factories). This median is in turn weighted  according to each market's weighting over the aggregate number of Inditex employees.

With the support of organisation such as Textile Exchange, Euratex,\nWrap, Circle Economy, Fashion for Good, ReFashion or Apparel Impact Institute, among others, the\nproject is aimed at establishing systems that harness the value and resources in existing textiles to\ncreate new products. This reduces the amount of textile waste going to landfill annually, therefore\nhelping reduce the environmental impacts of the industry and the need for virgin materials.\n\nn June 2021, the European arm of Accelerating Circularity was launched, with Inditex as a founding\npartner and member of its Steering Committee along with other representatives of fibre manufacturers,\nextile waste and supply chain experts, as well as brands and retailers. We are also members of this\ntiative’s Brand and Retailer Working Group in the United States. From our position, we work with the\nvalue chain actors such as collectors, sorters and mechanical and chemical recyclers of various\nechnologies to identify the requirements for producing recycled fibre using post-consumer textiles.\nThe short-term objective is to scale up pilot production of collections incorporating recycled fibres from\ntextile waste produced in Europe.\n\nin\n\nGlobal Fashion Agenda: Call to Action\n\nIn 2021, we continued to work with the non-profit organisation Global Fashion Agenda, which runs the\nGlobal Fashion Summit (formerly Copenhagen Fashion Summit) and calls upon fashion brands and\nretailers to implement actions to boost circularity.\n\nOf the projects in which we collaborate, we highlight our involvement in the Circular Fashion Partnership\nwith GFA, BGMEA and Reverse Resources.\n\nCircular Fashion Partnership\n\nInditex is one of the founding partners of this cross-sectoral project, led by Global Fashion Agenda with\nReverse Resources and BGMEA (a Bangladeshi employer association) as project partners. The aim is to\ndevelop the textile recycling industry in Bangladesh, using secondary raw materials from post-\nproduction fashion to make new products.\n\nThis project facilitates collaboration between textile manufacturers, recyclers and fashion brands\noperating in Bangladesh. The workflow is structured into two stages. The first focuses on traceability\nand recovering waste flows.

With the support of organisation such as Textile Exchange, Euratex,  Wrap, Circle Economy, Fashion for Good, ReFashion or Apparel Impact Institute, among others, the  project is aimed at establishing systems that harness the value and resources in existing textiles to  create new products. This reduces the amount of textile waste going to landfill annually, therefore  helping reduce the environmental impacts of the industry and the need for virgin materials.  \nIn June 2021, the European arm of Accelerating Circularity was launched, with Inditex as a founding  partner and member of its Steering Committee along with other representatives of fibre manufacturers,  textile waste and supply chain experts, as well as brands and retailers. We are also members of this  initiative’s Brand and Retailer Working Group in the United States. From our position, we work with the  value chain actors such as collectors, sorters and mechanical and chemical recyclers of various  technologies to identify the requirements for producing recycled fibre using post-consumer textiles.  The short-term objective is to scale up pilot production of collections incorporating recycled fibres from  textile waste produced in Europe.  \nGlobal Fashion Agenda: Call to Action  \nIn 2021, we continued to work with the non-profit organisation Global Fashion Agenda, which runs the  Global Fashion Summit (formerly Copenhagen Fashion Summit) and calls upon fashion brands and  retailers to implement actions to boost circularity.  \nOf the projects in which we collaborate, we highlight our involvement in the Circular Fashion Partnership  with GFA, BGMEA and Reverse Resources.  \nCircular Fashion Partnership  \nInditex is one of the founding partners of this cross-sectoral project, led by Global Fashion Agenda with  Reverse Resources and BGMEA (a Bangladeshi employer association) as project partners. The aim is to  develop the textile recycling industry in Bangladesh, using secondary raw materials from post- production fashion to make new products.  \nThis project facilitates collaboration between textile manufacturers, recyclers and fashion brands  operating in Bangladesh. The workflow is structured into two stages. The first focuses on traceability  and recovering waste flows. Manufacturers in Bangladesh work together with the partner brands and  are supported by Reverse Resources to establish the sorting of cutting waste at their premises. Waste  flows are combined with a recycling solution that provides an ‘integrated solution’ with traceability for  all the parties involved. In the second stage, once the waste flows have been redirected to recycling  solutions, the project’s participants assess the opportunity of making these flows circulate back into  production. The price of the material must be moderate (it must not exceed that of virgin material), fully  traceable and of the highest possible quality.  "}

The materials, technologies and processes that successfully come through this  pilot phase will continue to the next stages with the aim of testing their results in the commercial phase  and the industry in general. In 2021, we collaborated with more than 145 startups and took part in  more than 30 pilot tests to improve production processes, aspects of recyclability and recycling,  traceability and new materials, among others.

Thus, we inform our entire supply chain of the health and safety  requirements that all our articles must meet from the earliest stages of design before production begins.  \nAt Inditex we have gone one step further by creating advanced   standards that convey fundamental knowledge to ensure that the product   meets all health and safety requirements. \nClear to Wear (CtW) \nOur Clear to Wear (CtW) health standard regulates substances and parameters legally restricted for use  and restricts the use of some substances not included in current legislation that could potentially be a  health hazard. Likewise, it includes the European REACH regulation (Registration, Evaluation,  Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). Compliance with this EU regulation is mandatory for our  suppliers. Accordingly, Clear to Wear is consistent with the most exacting product health legislation. In  this regard, we work in partnership with scientific and technological advisers, research centres and  academic institutions.  \nThis standard is mandatory for all our apparel, footwear and accessories, including trimmings and  fabrics used in their manufacture.

We share this  experience through our involvement in initiatives such as Zero Discharge of Hazardous Chemicals  (ZDHC), of which we are Board members, Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) or AFIRM Group. We also  collaborate with a number of prestigious technological centres and universities.  \nMoreover, participating in Greenpeace's Clean Factory Approach encourages us to work in a  collaborative environment by sharing our experience with the rest of the industry and enhancing our  own knowledge through the experience of other retailers.  \n $\\odot$  More information in section 4.4.2. Partnerships of this Report.  \nInternal training   \nWith regard to raising awareness among our design and buying teams, we have strengthened product  health and safety areas across all our brands for the purposes of:   \n   Providing ongoing training to buying and design teams on all product health and safety related  issues.      Providing technical assistance on-site to buying and design teams.      Cutting the time required to detect potential breaches and providing solutions best suited to the  specific type of product.   \nIn 2021, 13 training sessions were provided to 296 attendees from internal design and buying teams  and the department of product health and safety itself. This training is conducted in partnership with  academic institutions and scientific and technological experts.  "}

Traceability management system\n\nInditex’s traceability management system is based on:\n\ne Requiring each supplier to know and share with us all the data of their own supply chain in the\nraceability management system. Factories registered in the system must pass the relevant filters\n‘o be approved and authorised. The management system itself includes social, environmental and\nproduct safety information for each of the facilities.\n\ne Requiring that our suppliers inform us, at all times, of the factories involved in our production (from\nraw materials to finishing processes). For every order received, suppliers must designate the\nparticipating factories, detailing units and processes. Each supplier is responsible for the factories\nhey use and must work with Inditex to ensure compliance with our sustainability standards, with\n\nany factories that fail to comply being excluded from the manufacture of our products. They must\n\ndigitalise the information using an in-house developed Traceability Management System, which has\nevolved to facilitate its use by stakeholders (both internal teams and suppliers), as well as to\n\nbroaden the scope of the information compiled, with a particular emphasis on raw materials\ntraceability.\n\nIn 2021, we began implementing our new i-Trust management system, which is an enhancement of\nthe previous version. The main goal is to enable suppliers to reflect the reality of their own supply chain\nin a flexible, usable and simple way. The system's scope will cover all possible variations of the supply\nchain set-up.\n\nWe have also developed a proof-of-concept in connection with a new traceability system based on\nblockchain methodology: i-Dots.

Traceability management system  \nInditex’s traceability management system is based on:  \n   Requiring each supplier to know and share with us all the data of their own supply chain in the  traceability management system. Factories registered in the system must pass the relevant filters  to be approved and authorised. The management system itself includes social, environmental and  product safety information for each of the facilities.     Requiring that our suppliers inform us, at all times, of the factories involved in our production (from  raw materials to finishing processes). For every order received, suppliers must designate the  participating factories, detailing units and processes. Each supplier is responsible for the factories  they use and must work with Inditex to ensure compliance with our sustainability standards, with  any factories that fail to comply being excluded from the manufacture of our products. They must  digitalise the information using an in-house developed Traceability Management System, which has  evolved to facilitate its use by stakeholders (both internal teams and suppliers), as well as to  broaden the scope of the information compiled, with a particular emphasis on raw materials  traceability.  \nIn 2021, we began implementing our new i-Trust management system, which is an enhancement of  the previous version. The main goal is to enable suppliers to reflect the reality of their own supply chain  in a flexible, usable and simple way. The system's scope will cover all possible variations of the supply  chain set-up.  \nWe have also developed a proof-of-concept in connection with a new traceability system based on  blockchain methodology: i-Dots. This new system covers a first use case for improving order traceability  information in a simplified way.  \n5.5.1.1.2. Traceability assessment  \nTo confirm in-situ that the Group's production takes place in properly declared and authorised factories,  the information entered by suppliers in the traceability management system is verified through  traceability audits, which follow three steps:  \n   Analyse the traceability management system information to identify the productions to be  checked.      Unannounced visit to the reported factory’s facilities to verify the production processes it can  perform, as well as production in progress and completed production.     Compare the findings from the visit with the information entered in the traceability tool, to verify  both the processes and the units completed by the factory.  \nTo select productions for verification, we perform a risk analysis, based on the information provided by  the suppliers in the management system and the data gathered by the clusters. In the event of any  indication of the existence of deviations in the traceability of the production, the clusters’ traceability  teams carry out additional investigations.  "}

It includes the following columns:\n\n1. **Suppliers with purchase in 2021**: Number of suppliers from each region who made a purchase in 2021.\n2. **Rejected due to a breach of the Code of Conduct**: Number of suppliers rejected for this reason.\n3. **Rejected for commercial reasons**: Number of suppliers rejected for these reasons.\n4. **Active suppliers at 31/01/2022**: Number of active suppliers as of this date.\n\n**Summary of Data:**\n\n- **Africa**: \n  - Suppliers with purchase: 194 \n  - Rejected (Code of Conduct): 0 \n  - Rejected (Commercial): 5 \n  - Active suppliers: 189\n\n- **Americas**: \n  - Suppliers with purchase: 12 \n  - Rejected (Code of Conduct): 0 \n  - Rejected (Commercial): 0 \n  - Active suppliers: 12\n\n- **Asia**: \n  - Suppliers with purchase: 978 \n  - Rejected (Code of Conduct): 7 \n  - Rejected (Commercial): 4 \n  - Active suppliers: 967\n\n- **Europe outside the EU**: \n  - Suppliers with purchase: 223 \n  - Rejected (Code of Conduct): 7 \n  - Rejected (Commercial): 0 \n  - Active suppliers: 216\n\n- **European Union**: \n  - Suppliers with purchase: 383 \n  - Rejected (Code of Conduct): 2 \n  - Rejected (Commercial): 0 \n  - Active suppliers: 381\n\n**Totals**:\n- Suppliers with purchase: 1,790\n- Rejected (Code of Conduct): 16\n- Rejected (Commercial): 9\n- Active suppliers: 1,765\nBlocking a supplier is a last resort, and that is why our support to suppliers and factories is not limited  merely to performing CAPs, but we also take various actions to prevent non-compliances in the first  place. At Inditex we believe in collaboration and ongoing dialogue with our suppliers as the basis of a  relationship of mutual trust for the benefit of both parties. In this way, we offer them support and  cooperation to improve their own supply chains, from the environmental point of view as well as to  promote human and labour rights for their workers.  \nDue to the particularities of each region, clusters play a key role in this task of providing support and  advice to suppliers. Comprised of local professionals with extensive experience in the field of  sustainability, as well as varied skills and abilities, these multidisciplinary teams are equipped to identify  the specific needs of each supply chain and to help suppliers meet global challenges.  \nFurthermore, ACT member brands have signed up to a series of commitments on purchasing practices  that also involve supplier relations, including a responsible exit. As a result, in the event that we decide  to stop working with a supplier for justified reasons, the relationship is terminated in a committed way,  with prior monitoring and follow-up work to minimise any potential impact.

Through this Priority Impact Area we  aim to obtain a holistic vision and work on identifying the needs of the workers in this part of our supply  chain through the corresponding due diligence processes that allow us to ensure that their fundamental  rights are respected.  \nThe primary strategic lines of this Priority Impact Area are as follows:  \nPromoting the well-being of workers in the supply chain of raw materials  \nThe workers who produce raw materials, such as cotton growers and farmers, present certain particularities  compared to those who work in factories. To address their specific needs, we partner with local and  international organisations and the communities themselves to promote sustainability.  \nSpecifically, in 2017 we entered into an enduring public-private partnership with the ILO which ensures that  the fundamental rights of cotton farmers in communities in India, China, Pakistan and Mali are upheld.

As\na result, the following key areas for collaboration were established:\ndecarbonising freight transport, improving value chain resilience, reducing\ncarbon capture risk, enhancing natural carbon sinks and boosting materials\ncircularity, along with two cross-cutting topics, namely data availability and the\nsocial dimensions of climate and sustainability solutions.\n\nThere was also significant engagement by the MIT community through the\nConsortium, harnessing MCSC financing in MIT’s Undergraduate Research\nOpportunities Program (UROP). In November 2021, the first annual MCSC\nsymposium was held at MIT and online, using a hybrid formula. This was a\nchance to involve the MIT community, MCSC member companies and other\nenterprises in the Consortium’s work.

In 2021,  a special employment centre was created to manufacture surgical masks, supported by Inditex which  donated five automated production lines worth 1.5 million euros, with a monthly production capacity of  13 million units. In addition, the facilities, located in Bergondo (A Coruña), were fully refurbished by the  Group to adapt to the requirements for producing surgical masks.  \nZara Tribute  \nZara Tribute is an initiative launched by Zara in 2021 to promote and channel support for community  activities through the design, launch and sale of capsule collections from the brand. Every season, these  capsule collections share a common thread and specific theme linked to community investment.  Furthermore, the proceeds from the sale of these limited editions are donated to the organisations  involved in the initiative.  \nIn its first season, Zara presented the Tribute Collection, commemorating and celebrating the great  talents of the fashion world in the 1990s, with a particular focus on top models and the pioneering work  of photographer Peter Lindbergh. The project is sponsored by the Peter Lindbergh Foundation and  curated by Fabien Baron.

This Plan is reviewed and, where applicable, updated annually in order to  adapt it to the Map, which determines the training needs in connection with criminal Compliance.  \nConsequently, the Plan determines and identifies the beneficiaries of the training, namely Inditex  employees who perform their jobs in areas with associated risks qualified as “high” in the Matrix, that  is: (i) those who are responsible for the management of controls associated with a risk event; (ii) those  who are involved in product purchase or contract third party supplies or services; (iii) those who,  although not responsible for the management of a given control, take part in the control configuration  process; and (iv) Group directors and authorised representatives.   \nIn addition, within the framework of the Inditex Group’s current compliance training plan, we highlight  the following training actions implemented in 2021:   \nNew hires   \nAll new Inditex Group hires receive from People teams initial information on the Code of Conduct and  Responsible Practices and the Ethics Line, which they undertake to observe upon signing their  employment contract. The contract includes a clause on adherence to this Code, or the relevant  certification.   "}

Given how important it  is for the Group’s goals that the technological systems function properly, it maintains, through the  Information Security department and with the support of the Information Security Committee, a  permanent control focused on guaranteeing the rationalisation and coherence of these systems, as well  as their security and stability, a prerequisite for the uninterrupted performance of its operations.  \nThe Group is guided by the Information Security Policy as a reference framework to maintain the  confidentiality, availability and integrity of information and the elements that process it.   \nThe Policy sets out the following general principles on which the achievement of the aforementioned  objectives must be based:   \n(i)   information is classified according to its value, importance and criticality for the business;  (ii)   the use of systems is limited to lawful and exclusively professional purposes;   (iii)   functions are segregated in order to avoid risks;   (iv)   when necessary or appropriate, information retention periods are established;   (v)   procedures are in place to control access to information by third parties;  (vi)   the security of information in the systems;   (vii)   a continuity management process is implemented to ensure the recovery of critical  information for the Group in the event of a disaster; and   (viii)   the Group's information and communications systems are in keeping with the requirements  of the legislation in force and with applicable internal regulations.   \nIt also defines the responsibilities and the scope of competence attributed to the various departments  and corresponding bodies within the Organisation.

Eligible revenue is that associated with real estate leases for each of the companies  belonging to the Group and reporting such revenue.  \nCapEx KPI  \nInditex Group projects as a whole are used to calculate the CapEx KPI.  \nIn this regard, the projects that might be considered for the CapEx KPI are taken into account to  calculate the KPI denominator, as indicated in Article 8 of the Regulation.   \nFor the numerator, the eligibility of the nature of the projects is examined, so that the numerator shall  comprise the aggregation of those projects that prove eligible. Eligible investments are those associated  mainly with activities linked to the construction, renovation and maintenance of buildings and efficiency  equipment in which the Group’s stores and logistic centres are located pursuant to sustainability and  efficiency criteria.  \nOpEx KPI  \nTo calculate the OpEx KPI, and in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation, the accounts associated  with research and development expenses, building renovation measures, short-term leases and  maintenance or repairs that ensure the proper functioning of the assets are identified. The aggregation of  these accounts is the denominator of this key performance indicator.  \nTo obtain the numerator, the details of the Cost Centre (hereinafter, CC) are extracted and the nature of  the expenditure is analysed, thereby ascertaining whether it is associated with an eligible activity  pursuant to the Regulation. Eligible expenses are those associated with: i) leases, ii) installation,  maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment.  \nThe Company has established the necessary control measures to guarantee the integrity of the information  throughout the process of preparing the indicators, as well as ensuring homogeneity of accounting criteria  used, and avoiding double counting or any duplication in the assignment of activities in the different  indicators.

Likewise, in line with best corporate governance practices, and pursuant to the  provisions of section 6.1 of the Diversity and Director Selection Policy, the Committee engaged an  external advisor, Heidrick&Struggles, to carry out the analysis of the suitability of the proposed  candidates out of a selection of profiles included in a list of potential directors.   \nBased on the foregoing, it can be inferred that the motions on the re-election and appointment of  directors were consistent with the analysis on the needs of the board and the Company itself, and that  the Nomination Committee has established that directors with a wide knowledge of business sit on the  board, together with others with background in other industries, and that in general, board membership  is diverse in terms of experiences and career – both domestic and international – age and gender.  \nBased on all the foregoing, the Nomination Committee considered that the re-election and appointment  process carried out by the Company in 2021 is aligned with the terms and goals set in the Diversity of  Board of Directors Membership and Director Selection Policy, observing its overarching principles, as  such process has been based on a prior analysis of the needs of the company and the Board of Directors,  and has contributed to encouraging a diverse membership on the board and its committees, in  particular gender diversity, seeking to ensure an appropriate board membership and contributing to  talent attraction.

Therefore, on the effective termination date of the Executive Chairman, i.e. 31 March 2022, 1  year and 2 months will have elapsed out of a total accrual period of 3 years. Since the metrics  associated with this cycle (PBT, TTTT, total TSR, relative TSR and sustainability index) are  measured as at the end of the cycle, it is not possible to determine a precise level of achievement.  Therefore, the Board of Directors has decided to consider as the level of achievement for the  purposes of the early settlement a “target” level of achievement in view of the good results of  Inditex in 2021. Therefore, the target incentive, pro-rated for the time elapsed from the  commencement of the cycle until the termination date, would amount to €421 thousand and  24,418 shares.   \n   Settlement of the annual variable remuneration for financial year 2022.  \nThe Board of Directors has deemed that the transfer of duties from the Executive Chairman to the  (non-executive) Chair of the Board of Directors and to the CEO has been successfully completed.

The CEO has  undertaken to hold for a term of at least 3 years the net shares that he may receive as a result of  any element of variable remuneration, until he holds a number of shares equivalent to at least 2  years of his fixed remuneration.
