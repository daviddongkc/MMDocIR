The system creates  a pool of candidates who may be eligible to immigrate to Canada permanently.  The system was  implemented “in an effort to solve the backlogs and skills mismatches that challenged the existing  selection system. The Express Entry system sought to speed up the processing of applications,  improve the ability of the selection system to address labor-market needs, reduce the inventory  (backlog) of applications, and enable selection of the best applicants.” 9  A person must be eligible  for one of the immigration programs to get into the pool. A person gets points based on the  information in their profile, including skills and work experience.
