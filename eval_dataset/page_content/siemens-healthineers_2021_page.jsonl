We\nwill also expand the local diagnostics portfolio in the area of\nimmunoassays and in clinical chemistry to become a leading\nmarket player in the burgeoning diagnostics segment. Digital\nhealthcare and technology-enabled services are a key differ-\nentiator and stated priority of the Chinese healthcare system.\n\nIn the Access to Care vector, we will be focusing on the approx.\nthree billion people worldwide who still do not have access to\nadequate healthcare today. The main obstacles here are a lack\nof infrastructure, financial affordability of treatment, and a lack\nof health awareness. As non-communicable diseases are set to\nbecome more prevalent in the coming years, affordable medical\ntechnology will need to cover a broader base than before. We\nwill double down on our efforts to provide good access to global\nhealthcare in the future, establish local networks actively, and\ndevelop on-site solutions. We will initially target selected coun-\ntries with dedicated resources. These local teams will identify\ncountry-specific success factors and pursue relevant business\nopportunities. To ensure scaling is a success, we will construct\na global network for the ongoing exchange of information. This\nnetwork will consolidate country-specific findings at a global\nlevel, leverage synergies, and develop appropriate local busi-\nness solutions that will be scaled at global level.\n\nResearch and development\n\nOur research and development activities (hereinafter “R&D”)\nare aimed at providing our customers with innovative and sus-\ntainable solutions while safeguarding and improving our com-\npetitiveness. We therefore focus our R&D activities on selected\ntechnologies and innovations. In particular, we have further\nexpanded our R&D activities in the area of digitalization and\nartificial intelligence (hereinafter “Al”). This development is re-\nflected in the expansion of our product and solution portfolio\nin this area: We now have 67 Al-based products and applica-\ntions on the market, as well as 15 in the innovation pipeline at\nvarious stages of productization, which are designed to further\nincrease our customers’ productivity and enable more precise\nand patient-specific clinical decisions.\n\nIn addition to launching new products, such as in our modal-\nities business, that rely strongly on the application of new Al\ntechnologies, Siemens Healthineers is also strengthening its\nofferings in the area of digital Al-based products and solutions.\nThe major additions are extensions of our Al-Rad Companion,\nour Al-Pathway Companion and Syngo Carbon products and\nsolutions. For fiscal year 2022, for example, we plan Al-Rad\nCompanion extensions for Mammography. In addition, we\nbrought to market an Al-Pathway Companion application for\nlung cancer. Our Al applications are supported by our teamplay\ndigital health platform. This platform connects data, systems,\napplications, people, and entire institutions, securely and from\ndifferent sources, and was awarded the European Privacy Seal\nfor data protection. Today, already more than 6,500 institutions\nacross the world are using teamplay. It connects more than\n32,000 systems and gives respective healthcare institutions\naccess to millions of patient records.\n\n06\n\nAlongside Al, sensing technology is another core technology\nand innovation field. Here we have developed a new innova-\ntive technology in computed tomography: the photon-counting\ncomputed tomography scanner. It comes with a novel system\nconcept and a new direct-converting detector. It adds new clin-\nical information to every image and improves image sharpness\nand contrast.\n\nIn the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (hereinafter “MRI\"),\nwe launched the MAGNETOM Free. platform which is designed\nto improve global access to care, simplify infrastructure require-\nments, to automate scan operation with myExam Companion,\nand all of that with the first 80 cm patient bore. MAGNETOM\nFree.Max also comes with Al-powered reconstruction engines\nenabling MRI acquisition and processing with sharper image\nquality. For MRI and other imaging systems, Syngo Virtual\nCockpit, our software solution for remote operation of equip-\nment, enables our customers to optimize the utilization of their\nscanner fleet and achieve a higher quality standard.\n\nIn our Diagnostics portfolio we continue to leverage Al-based\ntechnology. The Atellica COVID-19 Severity Algorithm, for ex-\nample, uses Al to help predict the likelihood of progression to\nsevere disease and life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction\namong hospitalized patients diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2\nvirus. Additionally, using Al, the Atellica Solution can help im-\nprove workflow by enabling the evaluation of up to 7,500 fea-\ntures of a sample or a sample carrier. Also, thousands of remotely\nconnected Atellica Solution instruments can transmit real-time,\nAl-powered data for continuous product and individual customer\nnetwork improvements.\n\nIn the Point of Care (hereinafter “POC”) field we launched the\nCLINITEST® Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test in fiscal year 2021 and\nwill continue to leverage new opportunities for rapid testing at\nthe point of care in the new fiscal.

We  will also expand the local diagnostics portfolio in the area of  immunoassays and in clinical chemistry to become a leading  market player in the burgeoning diagnostics segment. Digital  healthcare and technology-enabled services are a key differ- entiator and stated priority of the Chinese healthcare system. \nIn the Access to Care vector, we will be focusing on the approx.  three billion people worldwide who still do not have access to  adequate healthcare today. The main obstacles here are a lack  of infrastructure, financial affordability of treatment, and a lack  of health awareness. As non-communicable diseases are set to  become more prevalent in the coming years, affordable medical  technology will need to cover a broader base than before. We  will double down on our efforts to provide good access to global  healthcare in the future, establish local networks actively, and  develop on-site solutions. We will initially target selected coun- tries with dedicated resources. These local teams will identify  country-specific success factors and pursue relevant business  opportunities. To ensure scaling is a success, we will construct  a global network for the ongoing exchange of information. This  network will consolidate country-specific findings at a global  level, leverage synergies, and develop appropriate local busi- ness solutions that will be scaled at global level. \nResearch and development \nOur research and development activities (hereinafter  $\\!\\leftrightsquigarrow\\!\\mathsf{R}\\&D^{\\prime\\prime}\\right\\}$  )  are aimed at providing our customers with innovative and sus- tainable solutions while safeguarding and improving our com- petitiveness. We therefore focus our R&D activities on selected  technologies and innovations. In particular, we have further  expanded our R&D activities in the area of digitalization and  artificial intelligence (hereinafter  $\\ \"\\mathsf{A l}\"$  ). This development is re- flected in the expansion of our product and solution portfolio  in this area: We now have 67 AI-based products and applica- tions on the market, as well as 15 in the innovation pipeline at  various stages of productization, which are designed to further  increase our customers’ productivity and enable more precise  and patient-specific clinical decisions. \nIn addition to launching new products, such as in our modal- ities business, that rely strongly on the application of new AI  technologies, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers is also strengthening its  offerings in the area of digital AI-based products and solutions.  The major additions are extensions of our AI-Rad Companion,  our AI-Pathway Companion and Syngo Carbon products and  solutions. For fiscal year 2022, for example, we plan AI-Rad  Companion extensions for Mammography. In addition, we  brought to market an AI-Pathway Companion application for  lung cancer. Our AI applications are supported by our teamplay  digital health platform. This platform connects data, systems,  applications, people, and entire institutions, securely and from  different sources, and was awarded the European Privacy Seal  for data protection. Today, already more than 6,500 institutions  across the world are using teamplay. It connects more than  32,000 systems and gives respective healthcare institutions  access to millions of patient records. \nAlongside AI, sensing technology is another core technology  and innovation field. Here we have developed a new innova- tive technology in computed tomography: the photon-counting  computed tomography scanner. It comes with a novel system  concept and a new direct-converting detector. It adds new clin- ical information to every image and improves image sharpness  and contrast. \nIn the field of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (hereinafter   $\"{\\sf M R I}\"$  ),  we launched the MAGNETOM Free. platform which is designed  to improve global access to care, simplify infrastructure require- ments, to automate scan operation with myExam Companion,  and all of that with the first   $80~\\mathsf{c m}$   patient bore. ­ MAGNETOM  Free.Max also comes with AI-powered reconstruction engines  enabling MRI acquisition and processing with sharper image  quality. For MRI and other imaging systems, Syngo ­ Virtual  Cockpit, our software solution for remote operation of equip- ment, enables our customers to optimize the utilization of their  scanner fleet and achieve a higher quality standard. \nIn our Diagnostics portfolio we continue to leverage AI-based  technology. The Atellica COVID-19 Severity Algorithm, for ex- ample, uses AI to help predict the likelihood of progression to  severe disease and life-threatening multiorgan dysfunction  among hospitalized patients diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2  virus. Additionally, using AI, the Atellica Solution can help im- prove workflow by enabling the evaluation of up to 7,500 fea- tures of a sample or a sample carrier. Also, thousands of remotely  connected Atellica Solution instruments can transmit real-time,  AI-powered data for continuous product and individual customer  network improvements. \nIn the Point of Care (hereinafter  $\"\\mathsf{P O C}\"$  ) field we launched the  CLINITEST® Rapid COVID-19 Antigen Test in fiscal year 2021 and  will continue to leverage new opportunities for rapid testing at  the point of care in the new fiscal. POC will also expand into  new markets with the Atellica® VTLi Patient-side Immunoassay  Analyzer to reduce emergency department overcrowding with  the first highly sensitive test for cardiac troponin (hs-cTnI assay)  that provided accurate lab-comparable results in 8 minutes at  the patient’s side.

This trend poses major\nchallenges for global healthcare systems, both in developed and\nin emerging and developing economies. At the same time, how-\never, it offers opportunities for players in the healthcare industry\nbecause demand for cost-efficient healthcare solutions contin-\nues to intensify. The second trend is economic development in\nemerging countries, which is improving access to healthcare for\nmany people.

The third trend is the increase in chronic diseases as a\nconsequence of an aging population, and of environmental and\nlifestyle-related changes. This trend results in far more patients\nwith multiple morbidities, putting further pressure on health-\ncare systems and leading to higher costs; it also increases the\nneed for new, more timely ways to detect and treat disease. The\nfourth global trend with a significant impact on our business de-\nvelopment is the transformation of healthcare providers, which\nstems from a combination of societal and market forces driving\nhealthcare providers to operate and organize their businesses\ndifferently. Increasing cost pressure on the healthcare sector\nis prompting the introduction of new remuneration models\nfor healthcare services, such as value-based, rather than fee-\nfor-service, reimbursement. Digitalization and Al are likely to\nbecome key enablers for healthcare providers as the latter in-\ncreasingly focus on enhancing the overall patient experience,\nwith better outcomes and a general reduction in the cost of\ncare. This trend is driven partly by society’s increasing resistance\nto healthcare costs, the growing professionalization of paying\nentities, burdens from chronic disease, rapid scientific progress\nand staff shortages. In response to these factors, healthcare\nproviders are consolidating into networked structures, resulting\nin larger, often international, clinic and laboratory chains that\nincreasingly act like large corporations. Applying this industrial\nlogic to the healthcare market can lead to systematic improve-\nments in quality, while at the same time reducing costs.\n\nDriven by the need of healthcare systems worldwide to deliver\nbetter outcomes at lower costs, regulators around the world\nare increasingly seeking to introduce new remuneration models\n\n08\n\nfor healthcare services, leading to a shift in healthcare reim-\nbursement systems away from a pay-per-procedure towards\nan outcome-based model. Most developed countries are cur-\nrently considering or undergoing regulatory changes within\ntheir healthcare systems.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, too, impacted regulatory environments\nand practices, presenting governments and healthcare provid-\ners with unprecedented challenges. Regulatory authorities have\nutilized targeted methods to get diagnostic products to market\nfaster. Governments have also been quick to establish reim-\nbursement systems for testing. This includes changes in existing\nreimbursement structures as well as accelerated regulatory and\nemergency approval pathways. This had a positive influence on\nthe availability of diagnostic tests and access to reimbursement,\nfor example, for digital solutions such as telehealth in countries\nincluding China, the U.S. and Germany. This has underscored\nand increased the importance and value of such technologies\nduring the pandemic. However, these changes in health policy\nand reimbursement may be only temporary and could poten-\ntially be reversed or modified in the mid-term.\n\nIn the coming years, two of our most important markets, the\nU.S. and China, will face additional uncertainty when it comes\nto health policy and financing. With the new U.S. administra-\ntion heavily focused on the COVID-19 crisis, the regulatory en-\nvironment for healthcare has remained largely unchanged. At\nthe moment, topics such as the expansion of Medicare health\nservices and other associated questions are addressed in bills\nbefore Congress, and these could have an impact on our mar-\nket in the U.S. The impact of COVID-19 on government and\nprivate-sector finances has increased pressure on both device\nutilization and reimbursement systems.

The overall demand for radiation therapy will be driven  by a projected increase in new cancer incidences from about  19 million (in 2020) to 30 million annually by 2040. Faster  growth of new incidences in low- and middle-income coun- tries, which lack adequate infrastructure and human capital to  address this growing cancer burden, is accelerating demand  for radiation therapy as a cost-effective, high-quality cancer  care modality. Technological advancements with optimized  and automated clinical tools to improve accuracy in radio- therapy and radiosurgery continue to drive global demand for  new devices with digital solutions and applications to treat a  broader range of cases, reduce treatment time, and increase  patient throughput. The shortage of trained clinical personnel  in emerging markets, combined with a focus on operational  efficiencies and cost reduction in developed markets, are dri­ ving demand for more automated products and services that  can be integrated into clinical workflows to make treatments  more rapid and cost-effective. The radiotherapy and radiosur- gery markets are highly consolidated and served mainly by  Siemens ­ Healthineers, Elekta AB and Accuray Inc. \nUpgrades and innovations in clinical procedures are among the  major factors determining growth in the Advanced Therapies  market. Minimally invasive procedures as well as the growing  complexity of procedures that require sophisticated technolog- ical devices and advanced imaging are key market drivers. In  particular, technological innovations in imaging, robotics, med- ical devices and IT mean that minimally invasive procedures are  leading to lower risks of complications, faster recovery times,  less post-operative pain, shorter hospital stays and lower costs.  The global Advanced Therapies market can be described as  consolidated, with three top players: ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers,  Philips Healthcare and GE Healthcare. "}

As a result, the loans were effectively  converted into synthetic euro-denominated loans and actual  interest expenses decreased due to positive forward elements  of the forward exchange contracts. In total, the actual current  volume-weighted average interest rate of the transferred loans  decreased to approximately   $0.1\\,\\%$  . The loan maturing in fiscal  year 2046 carried a contractual interest rate of  $3.4\\,\\%$  . The loans  maturing in fiscal year 2022 are with variable interest rates. \nAs of September 30, 2021, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers continued to  participate in the cash pooling of the ­ Siemens Group, which  included the short-term investment of excess liquidity and the  borrowing of short-term funds within the ­ Siemens Group.  $\\mathsf{E x}$  cluded thereof are currently the entities that were acquired as  part of the acquisition of Varian. ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers intends  to set up its own cash pooling in the medium term in order to  (partially) replace the participation in the cash pooling of the  Siemens Group. \nIn addition, local bank facilities are in place to cover funding  needs of some ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers entities which have no  access to direct funding within ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers. \nAs in the previous year, the ­ Siemens Group granted two credit  facilities to ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers.

Our risk management is therefore an integral part of\nthe planning and implementation of our business strategies.\nThe risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. In\naccordance with our organizational and accountability struc-\nture, each of the respective managements of businesses, re-\ngions and functions is obliged to implement a comprehensive\nrisk management system. This is tailored to their specific area\nand its responsibilities, while at the same time being consistent\nwith the overall policy.\n\nCompany-wide risk management\n\nprocess and organization\n\n(Enterprise Risk Management Process)\n\nWe make use of a coordinated set of risk management and con-\ntrol systems. These should support us in the early recognition\nof developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our\nbusiness. The most important of these systems include our\ncompany-wide procedures for strategic planning and manage-\nment reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us\nin assessing potential risks well in advance of major business\ndecisions. Management reporting is intended to enable us to\nmonitor such risks more closely as our business progresses.\nOur internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and ef-\nfectiveness of our risk management. Accordingly, if deficits\nare detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate measures to\neliminate them. This coordination of processes and procedures\nis intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the\nSupervisory Board are fully informed about significant risks in\na timely manner.\n\nRisk management at Siemens Healthineers builds on a compre-\nhensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk\nManagement (ERM) approach. This approach is integrated into\nthe organization and addresses both risks and opportunities. It\nis based on the globally accepted COSO (Committee of Spon-\nsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework\n“Enterprise Risk Management — Integrating with Strategy and\nPerformance” (2017) as well as the ISO (International Organiza-\ntion for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018), and is adapted\nto Siemens Healthineers’ requirements.\n\n24\n\nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of,\nand response to, risks and opportunities that could materially\naffect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial\nand compliance objectives. The time horizon covered by ERM\nis typically three years. Our ERM is based on a net approach,\naddressing risks and opportunities that remain after the existing\ncontrol measures have been taken. If risks have already been\nconsidered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the financial state-\nments (for example as a provision or risk contingency), they\nare be incorporated, along with their financial impact, in the\nentity's business objectives. As a consequence, only additional\nrisks arising from the same subject (for example deviations from\nbusiness objectives, different impact perspectives) should be\nconsidered for the ERM. In order to provide a comprehensive\nview of our business activities, risks and opportunities are\nidentified in a structured procedure. This combines elements\nof both top-down and bottom-up approaches. While reporting\ngenerally follows a quarterly cycle, this regular reporting process\nis complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to\nescalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and op-\nportunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, con-\nsidering different perspectives, including business objectives,\nreputation and regulatory matters.

Hence it is essential to manage risks and opportunities appro- priately. Our risk management is therefore an integral part of  the planning and implementation of our business strategies.  The risk management policy is set by the Managing Board. In  accordance with our organizational and accountability struc- ture, each of the respective managements of businesses, re- gions and functions is obliged to implement a comprehensive  risk management system. This is tailored to their specific area  and its responsibilities, while at the same time being consistent  with the overall policy. \nCompany-wide risk management   process and organization   (Enterprise Risk Management Process) \nWe make use of a coordinated set of risk management and con- trol systems. These should support us in the early recognition  of developments that could jeopardize the continuity of our  business. The most important of these systems include our  company-wide procedures for strategic planning and manage- ment reporting. Strategic planning is intended to support us  in assessing potential risks well in advance of major business  decisions. Management reporting is intended to enable us to  monitor such risks more closely as our business progresses.  Our internal auditors regularly review the adequacy and ef- fectiveness of our risk management. Accordingly, if deficits  are detected, it is possible to adopt appropriate meas­ ures to  eliminate them. This coordination of processes and procedures  is intended to help ensure that the Managing Board and the  Super­ visory Board are fully informed about significant risks in  a timely manner. \nRisk management at ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers builds on a compre- hensive, interactive and management-oriented Enterprise Risk  Management (ERM) approach. This approach is integrated into  the organization and addresses both risks and opportunities. It  is based on the globally accepted COSO (Committee of Spon- soring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) framework  “Enterprise Risk Management – Integrating with Strategy and  Performance” (2017) as well as the ISO (International Organiza- tion for Standardization) Standard 31000 (2018), and is adapted  to ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers’ requirements. \nOur ERM process aims for early identification and evaluation of,  and response to, risks and opportunities that could materially  affect the achievement of our strategic, operational, financial  and compliance objectives. The time horizon covered by ERM  is typically three years. Our ERM is based on a net approach,  addressing risks and opportunities that remain after the existing  control meas­ ures have been taken. If risks have already been  considered in plans, budgets, forecasts or the financial state- ments (for example as a provision or risk contingency), they  are be incorporated, along with their financial impact, in the  entity’s business objectives. As a consequence, only additional  risks arising from the same subject (for example deviations from  business objectives, different impact perspectives) should be  considered for the ERM. In order to provide a comprehensive  view of our business activities, risks and opportunities are  identified in a structured procedure. This combines elements  of both top-down and bottom-up approaches. While reporting  generally follows a quarterly cycle, this regular reporting process  is complemented by an ad hoc reporting process that aims to  escalate critical issues in a timely manner. Relevant risks and op- portunities are prioritized in terms of impact and likelihood, con- sidering different perspectives, including business objectives,  reputation and regulatory matters. The bottom-up identifica- tion and prioritization process is supplemented by workshops  with the respective managements of the ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  businesses and regional levels. This top-down element ensures  that potential new risks and opportunities are discussed at the  management level and are included in the subsequent reporting  process, if found to be relevant. Reported risks and opportu- nities are analyzed for their potential cumulative effects and  are aggregated within and for each of the organizational levels  mentioned above. \nResponsibilities are assigned for all relevant risks and opportu- nities. The hierarchical level of responsibility depends on the  significance of the risk or opportunity. In a first step, assuming  responsibility involves choosing one of our general response  strategies. The general response strategies with respect to risks  are to avoid, transfer, reduce, retain or watch the relevant risk.  The general response strategy for opportunities is to pursue the  opportunity concerned. In a second step, responsibilities involve  developing, initiating and monitoring appropriate response  meas­ ures according to the chosen response strategy, within an  appropriate time frame. To allow for effective risk management,  these response meas­ ures must be specifically tailored to rele- vant circumstances. Accordingly, we have developed a variety  of response meas­ ures. "}

The highly\nvolatile situation and its consequences, as well as the varying\nregulations around the world, may expose us to the risk of\nvarious negative impacts on our company. Some of the po-\ntential key impacts include harm to our employees’ health and\nsafety, and the closure of offices and production facilities due\nto COVID-19 cases. Moreover vaccination and testing standards\nbeing established in some countries might result for example\nin the loss of employees. We could experience negative busi-\nness impacts in the form of disruptions of our supply chain,\ndelays in our time to market for certain products or product\nlifecycles, or changes in installation and service capacities.\nOther potential key impacts include revenue shortfalls for\nexample due to investment shifts, shifts in public funding or\nfinancial difficulties of customers. Investment shifts could par-\nticularly affect demand for medical imaging equipment insofar\nas they are not used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\nFurthermore, unforeseen expenses could adversely impact\nour financial position. In order to ensure business operations\nand reduce impacts of the pandemic on our business, we initi-\nated a broad spectrum of situational measures. These include\namong others protecting our workforce (through for example\nCOVID-19 testing, remote working and vaccinations), regular\ncrisis management team meetings led by the managing board\nand dedicated task forces, coordinating local response plans,\nand ensuring close coordination with suppliers. We continue to\nobserve the situation, including changes in pandemic-related\nrestrictions, on an ongoing basis in order to quickly identify\nnew developments, evaluate potential impacts, assess risks and\nmake adjustments where necessary.\n\nProduct development and introduction\n\nWe develop, produce and sell a comprehensive portfolio of\nproducts, solutions and services (including accessories and\nsoftware products) to a wide range of healthcare providers.\nWith many of our products, solutions and services we are an\nindustry-wide technology leader. Our operating results depend\nto a significant extent on our technological leadership, as well\nas our ability to anticipate changes in our markets and to adapt\nus the costs of producing our products to those changes. Our\nproducts, solutions, services and their enhancements often\nhave long development and government approval cycles. As a\nresult, this requires us to maintain early and accurate anticipa-\ntion of relevant changes in the marketplace, in technology and\nin customer demands. Introducing new products and technol-\nogies requires a significant commitment to R&D, which in turn\nrequires expenditure of considerable financial resources that\nmay not always result in success. Our results of operations could\nbe negatively impacted if we invest in technologies that do not\noperate as expected or cannot be integrated as planned, or that\ndo not find the expected market acceptance. The same applies\nif our products, solutions or services are not introduced to the\nmarket at the targeted margins in a timely manner particularly\ncompared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. Fur-\nthermore, errors in the design of our products or operational\ndisruptions in our value chain could result in quality problems\n\n27\n\nor potential product, labor safety, regulatory or environmental\nrisks. The correction of errors could lead to unforeseen costs,\nat the same time result in guarantee or warranty claims, and,\nmoreover, adversely impact our reputation. Our patents and\nother intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors\nfrom independently developing or selling products and services\nthat resemble or replicate our own. If we are unable to protect\nor effectively enforce our intellectual property rights against\nthe competition, we might lose our technical leadership posi-\ntion and market share which could result in negative financial\nimpact, loss of reputation or customers. To counter these risks,\nwe continuously initiate and implement measures for quality\nimprovement, project risk management and claim prevention\nthat contribute to the mitigation of existing risks. In addition,\nwe closely monitor market developments in order to identify\nand react on new demands early on.

The highly  volatile situation and its consequences, as well as the varying  regulations around the world, may expose us to the risk of  various negative impacts on our company. Some of the po- tential key impacts include harm to our employees’ health and  safety, and the closure of offices and production facilities due  to COVID-19 cases. Moreover vaccination and testing standards  being established in some countries might result for example  in the loss of employees. We could experience negative busi - ness impacts in the form of disruptions of our supply chain,  delays in our time to market for certain products or product  lifecycles, or changes in installation and service capacities.  Other potential key impacts include revenue shortfalls for  example due to investment shifts, shifts in public funding or  financial difficulties of customers. Investment shifts could par- ticularly affect demand for medical imaging equipment insofar  as they are not used in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.  Furthermore, unforeseen expenses could adversely impact  our financial position. In order to ensure business operations  and reduce impacts of the pandemic on our business, we initi- ated a broad spectrum of situational meas­ ures. These include  among others protecting our workforce (through for example  COVID-19 testing, remote working and vaccinations), regular  crisis management team meetings led by the managing board  and dedicated task forces, coordinating local response plans,  and ensuring close coordination with suppliers. We continue to  observe the situation, including changes in pandemic-related  restrictions, on an ongoing basis in order to quickly identify  new developments, evaluate potential impacts, assess risks and  make adjustments where necessary. \nProduct development and introduction \nWe develop, produce and sell a comprehensive portfolio of  products, solutions and services (including accessories and  software products) to a wide range of healthcare providers.  With many of our products, solutions and services we are an  industry-wide technology leader. Our operating results depend  to a significant extent on our technological leadership, as well  as our ability to anticipate changes in our markets and to adapt  us the costs of producing our products to those changes. Our  products, solutions, services and their enhancements often  have long development and government approval cycles. As a  result, this requires us to maintain early and accurate anticipa- tion of relevant changes in the marketplace, in technology and  in customer demands. Introducing new products and technol- ogies requires a significant commitment to R&D, which in turn  requires expenditure of considerable financial resources that  may not always result in success. Our results of operations could  be negatively impacted if we invest in technologies that do not  operate as expected or cannot be integrated as planned, or that  do not find the expected market acceptance. The same applies  if our products, solutions or services are not introduced to the  market at the targeted margins in a timely manner particularly  compared to our competitors, or even become obsolete. Fur- thermore, errors in the design of our products or operational  disruptions in our value chain could result in quality problems  or potential product, labor safety, regulatory or environmental  risks. The correction of errors could lead to unforeseen costs,  at the same time result in guarantee or warranty claims, and,  moreover, adversely impact our reputation. Our patents and  other intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors  from independently developing or selling products and services  that resemble or replicate our own. If we are unable to protect  or effectively enforce our intellectual property rights against  the competition, we might lose our technical leadership posi- tion and market share which could result in negative financial  impact, loss of reputation or customers. To counter these risks,  we continuously initiate and implement meas­ ures for quality  improvement, project risk management and claim prevention  that contribute to the mitigation of existing risks. In addition,  we closely monitor market developments in order to identify  and react on new demands early on. We constantly apply for  new patents and actively manage our intellectual property port- folio to safeguard our leading technological position. \n\nSupply Chain Management (SCM) \nWe purchase parts, components, services and materials from  third parties, contract manufacturers and service providers all  over the world. Therefore, we may be exposed to the risk of  delays and interruptions in the supply chain as a consequence  of global economic and geopolitical dynamics, extreme events  (including pandemics), cyber incidents or suppliers’ financial  difficulties, particularly if we are unable to establish alternative  sources of supply or means of transportation in a timely man- ner or at all. In addition, we rely upon the supplies of certain  raw materials. Worldwide demand, availability and pricing of  these raw materials have been volatile recently, and we expect  that they will continue to fluctuate in the future. Changes in  customer demand and market fluctuations for critical parts and  components such as semiconductors might lead to difficulties  in meeting our quality requirements while also purchasing  in sufficient quantities at competitive market prices. Delays,  restrictions, shortages or unavailability of supplies could lead  to unanticipated price increases and could constrain our pro- duction of affected products which could in turn reduce our  profit margins or otherwise adversely affect our performance.  If we are not able to offset increased prices for certain materi- als and components, reduce reliance on them, or find suitable  alternatives, this could result in additional costs and affect our  customer relationships. Some of the components included in  our products are obtained from a limited group of suppliers or  from a sole-source supplier. We are also dependent on our own  production and distribution sites. If a supplier’s operations are  disrupted, we lose a critical supplier, or if one of them no longer  meets performance or quality specifications, we may be re- quired to obtain and qualify one or more replacement suppliers.  Such an event may then also require us to redesign or modify  our products to incorporate new parts and  /  or further require  us to obtain clearance, qualification, certification or other ap- plicable regulatory approvals of these products. Events such as  these could significantly increase costs for the affected product  and cause material delays in delivery of our products, which  could have an adverse effect on our financial positions and re- sults of operations. To counter these risks, we work closely with  reliable and competent suppliers to ensure consistent supplies  and minimize disruptions to our supply chain. When develop- ing new products, we address these risks at an early stage of  the product life cycle. Besides that, we conduct supplier health  screenings and audits to proactively establish relevant meas­ ures. In addition, we retain certain safety stocks and qualify sec- ond-source suppliers for essential components. We also manage  procurement and pricing through meas­ ures such as long-term  contracts and hedging as well as bundling of demands across  units within our company and the ­ Siemens Group. Moreover,  we actively monitor price developments to be able to react early  to market changes. "}

Unless indi-\ncated otherwise, the opportunities described below relate to\nall of our segments.\n\nGrowth fields\n\nInnovation, digital offerings and new business models are core\nfor our company in shaping the future of the healthcare indus-\ntry. We invest significantly in research and development in order\nto develop innovative products, solutions and services for our\ncustomers, including in the area of digitalization. In doing so,\nwe aim to safeguard our competitiveness at the same time. Our\ngoal is to enable healthcare providers to create added value by\nexpanding precision medicine, transforming care delivery and\nimproving patient experience by leveraging digital technolo-\ngies. We expect to be able to meet future demands arising from\nfundamental trends. These trends include demographic change\nand global population growth as well as the increasing burden\nof chronic diseases. We continuously strive to grow and expand\nour business in established markets, open up new markets for\nexisting portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in\norder to gain a higher market share and improved profitability.\nIn addition, we aim to further develop our product portfolio\nand also grow into adjacent fields, especially in high-growth\ncustomer segments. This is achieved through various meas-\nures, such as targeted product development (for example entry\nlevel systems), the expansion of our consulting competencies to\nstrengthen our position as a trusted partner, the assessment of\nnew market entry strategies as well as M&A activities. We also\ntackle opportunities to contribute the know-how and technol-\nogy of our company and its employees in adjacent areas for the\nbenefit of patients and healthcare providers and thus generate\nadditional business growth. Moreover, we see the opportunity\nto generate additional sales volume and profit from new and\ninnovative digital products, services and solutions, including\ncybersecurity for our customers, preventive maintenance and\ndata analytics. Furthermore, additional business opportuni-\nties could also arise from long-term value partnerships with\nhealthcare providers, supporting our customers in setting up\ncenters of excellence and jointly co-creating on solutions. Fur-\nther business opportunities could also arise from the devel-\nopments around the COVID-19 pandemic such as systems and\ntest related to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 as\nwell as increased investments in healthcare including technol-\nogy-enabled healthcare solutions. In addition, the provision of\nfunds by aid organizations such as the World Health Organiza-\ntion (WHO) or the EU and as well as the provision of national\nfunds or subsidies could further increase. This would expand\ninvestment and spending in private hospitals, for example in\nthe Middle East and Africa, Asia and Europe. This in turn could\ngenerate additional growth in these markets, especially for\nstandard and basic products and services. In our Diagnostics\nsegment, further collaboration with third parties could create\nopportunities for increased revenue and margins on existing\nsystem platforms through creation of an even broader range of\nassays in addition to our own development assays and a faster\navailability for our customers.\n\n30\n\nEfficiency gains\n\nOur comprehensive and structured approach to our internal dig-\nital transformation and related investments could potentially\nsupport our growth, improve our cost position and increase our\nattractiveness as employer. The leverage of our digital skills,\ninfrastructure, tools and data could enable us to achieve a\nsignificant increase in our economic performance across the\nentire value chain of the company. Further investments into\nefficiency measures, and the use of new technologies such as\nmachine learning, digital twins and Artificial Intelligence, could\npotentially drive additional improvements in our processes and\ncost structures. Increased harmonization, collaboration and\ntransparency throughout the entire organization could create\nsynergies, lead to a faster decision-making process and reduce\nredundant efforts. Localizing certain value-chain activities, such\nas procurement, production, logistics, maintenance and service,\nfor example in emerging markets, could enable us to reduce\ncosts and strengthen our global competitive position, in particu-\nlar compared to competitors based in countries with more favor-\nable cost structures. In supply chain management and product\nlifecycle management, opportunities for improvement could\narise from further implementing an integrated digital tool land-\nscape. The improvements could also include further efficiency\ngains from using standardized platform elements across multi-\nple applications. Utilizing these synergies could further increase\nour flexibility and speed in adjusting our innovative solution\nportfolio to the needs of the market while optimizing product\nlifecycle costs and reducing internal complexity.\n\nAssessment of the overall opportunity situation\nThe order in which they are presented reflects the currently\nestimated exposure for Siemens Healthineers associated with\nthese opportunities.

We invest significantly in research and development in order  to develop innovative products, solutions and services for our  customers, including in the area of digitalization. In doing so,  we aim to safeguard our competitiveness at the same time. Our  goal is to enable healthcare providers to create added value by  expanding precision medicine, transforming care delivery and  improving patient experience by leveraging digital technolo- gies. We expect to be able to meet future demands arising from  fundamental trends. These trends include demographic change  and global population growth as well as the increasing burden  of chronic diseases. We continuously strive to grow and expand  our business in established markets, open up new markets for  existing portfolio elements and strengthen our installed base in  order to gain a higher market share and improved profitability.  In addition, we aim to further develop our product portfolio  and also grow into adjacent fields, especially in high-growth  customer segments. This is achieved through various meas­ ures, such as targeted product development (for example entry  level systems), the expansion of our consulting competencies to  strengthen our position as a trusted partner, the assessment of  new market entry strategies as well as M&A activities. We also  tackle opportunities to contribute the know-how and technol- ogy of our company and its employees in adjacent areas for the  benefit of patients and healthcare providers and thus generate  additional business growth. Moreover, we see the opportunity  to generate additional sales volume and profit from new and  innovative digital products, services and solutions, including  cybersecurity for our customers, preventive maintenance and  data analytics. Furthermore, additional business opportuni- ties could also arise from long-term value partnerships with  healthcare providers, supporting our customers in setting up  centers of excellence and jointly co-creating on solutions. Fur- ther business opportunities could also arise from the devel- opments around the COVID-19 pandemic such as systems and  test related to the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 as  well as increased investments in healthcare including technol- ogy-enabled healthcare solutions. In addition, the provision of  funds by aid organizations such as the World Health Organiza- tion (WHO) or the EU and as well as the provision of national  funds or subsidies could further increase. This would expand  investment and spending in private hospitals, for example in  the Middle East and Africa, Asia and Europe. This in turn could  generate additional growth in these markets, especially for  standard and basic products and services. In our Diagnostics  segment, further collaboration with third parties could create  opportunities for increased revenue and margins on existing  system platforms through creation of an even broader range of  assays in addition to our own development assays and a faster  availability for our customers. \nEfficiency gains \nOur comprehensive and structured approach to our internal dig- ital transformation and related investments could potentially  support our growth, improve our cost position and increase our  attractiveness as employer. The leverage of our digital skills,  infrastructure, tools and data could enable us to achieve a  significant increase in our economic performance across the  entire value chain of the company. Further investments into  efficiency meas­ ures, and the use of new technologies such as  machine learning, digital twins and Artificial Intelligence, could  potentially drive additional improvements in our processes and  cost structures. Increased harmonization, collaboration and  transparency throughout the entire organization could create  synergies, lead to a faster decision-making process and reduce  redundant efforts. Localizing certain value-chain activities, such  as procurement, production, logistics, maintenance and service,  for example in emerging markets, could enable us to reduce  costs and strengthen our global competitive position, in particu- lar compared to competitors based in countries with more favor- able cost structures. In supply chain management and product  lifecycle management, opportunities for improvement could  arise from further implementing an integrated digital tool land- scape. The improvements could also include further efficiency  gains from using standardized platform elements across multi- ple applications. Utilizing these synergies could further increase  our flexibility and speed in adjusting our innovative solution  portfolio to the needs of the market while optimizing product  lifecycle costs and reducing internal complexity. \nAssessment of the overall opportunity situation \nThe order in which they are presented reflects the currently  estimated exposure for ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers associated with  these opportunities. The described opportunities are not neces- sarily the only ones we encounter. In addition, our assessment  of opportunities is subject to change, as ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers,  our markets and technologies are constantly developing. It is  also possible that opportunities we foresee today will never  materialize. "}

Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n**Non-current assets:**\n- Property, plant, and equipment: 0 for both 2021 and 2020.\n- Financial assets: 31,767 in 2021; 19,209 in 2020.\n\n**Current assets:**\n- Receivables and other assets: 2,182 in 2021; 1,583 in 2020.\n- Cash and cash equivalents: 3 in 2021; 0 in 2020.\n\n**Prepaid expenses:** 9 in 2021; 45 in 2020.\n\n**Active difference resulting from offsetting:** 0 for both years.\n\n**Total assets:**\n- 33,961 in 2021.\n- 20,837 in 2020.\n\n**Shareholders’ Equity:** \n- 18,509 in 2021.\n- 15,868 in 2020.\n\n**Provisions:**\n- Pensions and similar commitments: 27 in 2021; 22 in 2020.\n- Other provisions: 153 in 2021; 195 in 2020.\n\n**Liabilities:**\n- Liabilities to affiliated companies and other liabilities: 15,181 in 2021; 4,752 in 2020.\n\n**Deferred income:** 91 in 2021; no data for 2020.\n\n**Total liabilities and equity:**\n- Matches total assets, 33,961 in 2021 and 20,837 in 2020.\nNon-current assets \nThe increase in financial assets by  $\\in{12,557}$   million was primar- ily attributable to the following transactions:  \nSiemens ­ Healthineers AG made euro- and US dollar-denominated  additional capital payments available to ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  Holding I GmbH for the acquisition of Varian. This increased the  investment carrying amount by € 13,984 million. \nAs part of the transaction to optimize its corporate structure  following the acquisition of Varian, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG ac- quired shares in an affiliated company of ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  Holding I GmbH by way of an exchange transaction. In the  next step, the Company contributed the shares acquired to  Siemens ­ Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG; this step  also fulfilled an obligation to make a contribution of € 3,000 mil- lion, which has existed since September 2020. For this reason,  financial assets declined by  $\\textup{\\texteuro}\\,3,000$   million. \nThe assumption of the loan plus the interest liability from  Siemens ­ Healthineers Beteiligungen GmbH & Co. KG on the  transfer date and the withdrawal of the associated forward for- eign exchange transactions led to an increase in the investment  carrying amount totalling € 1,509 million. "}

These involve complex and subjective assessments and  the use of assumptions, some of which may be for matters that  are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change. Accounting  estimates and judgments could change from period to period  and could have a material impact on net assets, financial posi- tion and results of operations. In addition, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  could reasonably have made accounting estimates differently  in the same accounting period. ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers cautions  that future events often vary from forecasts and that estimates  routinely require adjustments. Estimates and assumptions are  reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates and as- sumptions are recognized in the period in which the changes  occur and in future periods impacted by the changes. \n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and associated significant uncer- tainties have been considered, where relevant, in accounting  estimates and judgments. In fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19  pandemic did not lead to material adjustments to the carry- ing amounts of recognized assets and liabilities. For further  information on impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, see dis- closures in the respective notes to the consolidated financial  statements and in the group management report. \nBasis of consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of  Siemens ­ Healthineers AG and the subsidiaries over which con- trol is exercised. ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG controls an investee  if it has direct or indirect power over the investee, exposure  or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the in- vestee, and the ability to use its power over the investee to  affect the amount of the investor’s returns. \nBusiness combinations \nThe costs of an acquisition are meas­ ured at the fair value of  the assets given and the liabilities incurred or assumed at the  acquisition date.

Transactions resulting in changes in the proportion of  equity held by non-controlling interests that do not result in  the loss of control by the Group are accounted for as equity  transactions not affecting profit or loss.

At the date control is\nlost, the entity concerned is deconsolidated and any remain-\ning equity interests of the Group are remeasured to fair value\nthrough profit or loss.\n\nAsa writer of a put option on non-controlling interests, Siemens\nHealthineers assesses whether the prerequisites for the trans-\nfer of present ownership interests are fulfilled at the balance\nsheet date. If Siemens Healthineers is not the beneficial owner\nof the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put\noption will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated\nas a transaction between shareholders with the corresponding\nrecognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise\nprice. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and\nlosses during the reporting period.\n\nForeign currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the func-\ntional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the\nspot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while\nincome and expenses are translated using monthly average ex-\nchange rates. Differences arising from such translations are rec-\nognized within equity and reclassified to profit or loss when the\ngain or loss on disposal of the foreign operation is recognized.\nThe items within the consolidated statements of cash flows are\ntranslated at monthly average exchange rates, whereas cash\nand cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate\nat the end of the reporting period.\n\nForeign currency transactions\n\nTransactions in a currency other than the functional currency\nof an entity are recorded, on initial recognition, in that func-\ntional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate at the date\nof the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, foreign\ncurrency-denominated monetary items are translated applying\nthe spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses\narising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized\nin profit or loss. Foreign currency-denominated non-monetary\nitems are subsequently translated using the historical spot\nexchange rate.\n\nRevenue recogni\n\non\n\nSiemens Healthineers recognizes revenue when, or as, control\nover distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer.\nThis requires, among others, that a contract with enforceable\nrights and obligations exists, the customer is committed to\nits contractual obligations, and collectability of consideration\nis probable, taking the customer's creditworthiness into ac-\ncount. Revenue is the transaction price Siemens Healthineers\nexpects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in\nthe transaction price if it is highly probable that no significant\nreversal of revenue will occur once associated uncertainties\nare resolved. Accounting estimates are involved in determin-\ning the amount of variable consideration, which is calculated\nby using either the expected value or the most likely amount\n\n48\n\ndepending on which is expected to better predict the amount\nof variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the\ntime value of money if the period between the transfer of\ngoods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve\nmonths and there is a significant financing benefit to either\nthe customer or Siemens Healthineers. If a contract contains\nmore than one distinct good or service, the transaction price\nis allocated to each performance obligation based on relative\nstand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not\ndirectly observable, Siemens Healthineers reasonably estimates\nthem, primarily by using historical reference values. Revenue\nis recognized for each performance obligation either at a point\nin time or over time.\n\nRevenue from the sale of goods: Revenue is recognized at a\npoint in time when control of the goods (especially equipment,\nreagents and consumables) passes to the customer, usually\nupon delivery of the goods. Payment terms typically do not\nexceed 90 days after customer acceptance.\n\nRevenue from services: Revenue is recognized over time on a\nstraight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than\nstraight-line, as services are provided. Service contracts can\nalso include extended warranties, which cover periods beyond\nthe statutory or customary warranty period and for which rev-\nenue is recognized straight-line over the extended warranty\nperiod.

Contract assets primarily relate to the sale of goods\nfor which transfer of control to the customer occurs before\n", "vlm_text": "\nAs a writer of a put option on non-controlling interests, ­ Siemens  Healthineers assesses whether the prerequisites for the trans- fer of present ownership interests are fulfilled at the balance  sheet date. If ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers is not the beneficial owner  of the shares underlying the put option, the exercise of the put  option will be assumed at each balance sheet date and treated  as a transaction between shareholders with the corresponding  recognition of a purchase liability at the respective exercise  price. The non-controlling interests participate in profits and  losses during the reporting period. \nForeign currency translation \nAssets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries, where the func- tional currency is other than the euro, are translated using the  spot exchange rate at the end of the reporting period, while  income and expenses are translated using monthly average ex- change rates. Differences arising from such translations are rec- ognized within equity and reclassified to profit or loss when the  gain or loss on disposal of the foreign operation is recognized.  The items within the consolidated statements of cash flows are  translated at monthly average exchange rates, whereas cash  and cash equivalents are translated at the spot exchange rate  at the end of the reporting period. \nForeign currency transactions \nTransactions in a currency other than the functional currency  of an entity are recorded, on initial recognition, in that func- tional currency, by applying the spot exchange rate at the date  of the transaction. At the end of each reporting period, foreign  currency-denominated monetary items are translated applying  the spot exchange rate prevailing at that date. Gains and losses  arising from these foreign currency revaluations are recognized  in profit or loss. Foreign currency-denominated non-monetary  items are subsequently translated using the historical spot  exchange rate. \nRevenue recognition \nSiemens ­ Healthineers recognizes revenue when, or as, control  over distinct goods or services is transferred to the customer.  This requires, among others, that a contract with enforceable  rights and obligations exists, the customer is committed to  its contractual obligations, and collectability of consideration  is probable, taking the customer’s credit worthiness into ac- count. Revenue is the transaction price ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  expects to be entitled to. Variable consideration is included in  the transaction price if it is highly probable that no significant  reversal of revenue will occur once associated uncertainties  are resolved. Accounting estimates are involved in determin- ing the amount of variable consideration, which is calculated  by using either the expected value or the most likely amount  depending on which is expected to better predict the amount  of variable consideration. Consideration is adjusted for the  time value of money if the period between the transfer of  goods or services and the receipt of payment exceeds twelve  months and there is a significant financing benefit to either  the customer or ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers. If a contract contains  more than one distinct good or service, the transaction price  is allocated to each performance obligation based on relative  stand-alone selling prices. If stand-alone selling prices are not  directly observable, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers reasonably estimates  them, primarily by using historical reference values. Revenue  is recognized for each performance obligation either at a point  in time or over time. \n\nRevenue from the sale of goods:  Revenue is recognized at a  point in time when control of the goods (especially equipment,  reagents and consumables) passes to the customer, usually  upon delivery of the goods. Payment terms typically do not  exceed 90 days after customer acceptance. \nRevenue from services:  Revenue is recognized over time on a  straight-line basis or, if the performance pattern is other than  straight-line, as services are provided. Service contracts can  also include extended warranties, which cover periods beyond  the statutory or customary warranty period and for which rev- enue is recognized straight-line over the extended warranty  period. Customer payments are typically received on a monthly  or quarterly basis over the contract term. \nRevenue from construction-type contracts:  Revenue is recog- nized over time under the percentage-of-completion method,  based on the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to  total estimated costs. An expected loss on the contract is recog- nized as an expense immediately. Within contracts, customer  payments are agreed on the basis of quantified performance  indicators or the achievement of specific events or milestones,  usually due no later than 90 days after invoicing. The percent- age-of-completion method places considerable importance  on accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards com- pletion and may involve estimates on the scope of deliveries  and services required to fulfill the contractually defined obliga- tions. Estimates include total estimated costs, total estimated  revenues, and contract risks including technical, political and  regulatory risks. Under the percentage-of-completion method,  changes in estimates may lead to an increase or decrease of  revenue for the period. In addition, it is necessary to assess  whether the most likely scenario for a contract is its continu- ation or its termination. For this assessment, all relevant facts  and circumstances relating to the contract are considered on  an individual basis. \nContract assets, contract liabilities, receivables:  When either  party to a contract with a customer has performed its con- tractual obligations, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers presents a contract  asset or a contract liability depending on the relationship be- tween ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers’ performance and the customer’s  payment. Contract assets primarily relate to the sale of goods  for which transfer of control to the customer occurs before  Siemens ­ Healthineers has an unconditional right to consider- ation. Contract liabilities result mainly from customer advances  on services and from prepayments for goods not yet shipped.  Contract assets and contract liabilities are presented net at the  contract level and as current because they arise in the course of  the regular operating cycle. Receivables are recognized when  the right to consideration becomes unconditional.  Valuation  allowances for credit risks are set up for contract  assets and  receivables according to the accounting policy for ­ financial as- sets meas­ ured at amortized cost. "}

For  the purpose of impairment testing, the segment’s recoverable  amount is to be determined as the higher of the segment’s fair  value less costs of disposal and its value in use. If either of these  values exceeds the carrying amount, it is not necessary to de- termine both values. If the carrying amount of the segment to  which the goodwill is allocated exceeds its recoverable amount,  an impairment loss on goodwill allocated to this segment is  recognized. Impairment losses on goodwill are not reversed  in future periods. \nThe segment’s recoverable amount is based on discounted  cash flow calculations and involves the use of accounting esti- mates. The amount is influenced by, for example, the market  launch of new goods and services, the successful integration  of acquisitions, volatility of capital markets, interest rate de- velopments, exchange rate fluctuations and the outlook on  economic trends. At ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers, the recoverable  amount is generally determined based on the fair value less  costs of disposal. For the purpose of estimating a segment’s  fair value less costs of disposal, cash flows are projected for the  next five years (in exceptional cases up to ten years) based on  past experience, actual operating results and management’s  best estimate about future developments as well as on market  assumptions. Cash flows after the detailed planning period are  extrapolated using individual growth rates. The determined fair  value of a segment is assigned to level 3 of the fair value hierar- chy. Key assumptions on which the determinations of fair val- ues less costs of disposal are based include estimated terminal  value growth rates and discount rates. Both assumptions are  determined individually for each segment. The discount rates  correspond to the segment’s weighted average cost of capi- tal and are calculated based on a risk-free interest rate and a  market risk premium. In addition, the discount rates reflect the  current market assessment of the risks specific to each seg- ment by taking into account specific peer group information  on beta factors, leverage and cost of debt. The parameters for  calculating the discount rates are based on external sources of  information. The peer groups undergo an annual review and  are adjusted, if necessary. Terminal value growth rates consider  external macroeconomic data and industry-specific trends. The  accounting estimates, including the methodology applied, can  have a material impact on the respective values and ultimately  the amount of any goodwill impairment. Additionally, the out- come of goodwill impairment tests may depend on the alloca- tion of goodwill to the segments. "}

If the recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be\ndetermined, the impairment test is performed at the level of\nthe cash-generating unit. A cash-generating unit is the small-\nest identifiable group of assets that includes the asset to be\ntested for impairment and that generates cash inflows, which\nare largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets\nor groups of assets. When determining the relevant cash-gener-\nating unit, various factors need to be considered, including how\nmanagement monitors operations or makes decisions about\ncontinuing or disposing of assets and operations.

At the same time, a receivable from finance leases is recog- nized at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease.  In the following periods, interest income is realized using the  effective interest method, reflecting a constant periodic rate of  return of the net investment. Under operating leases, the rented  equipment is recognized as property, plant and equipment and  is depreciated on a straight-line basis over its useful life. Income  from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over  the lease term. \nSiemens ­ Healthineers as lessee applies the right-of-use model,  means right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized,  which normally correspond to the discounted lease payments  at initial meas­ urement. The right-of-use model is not applied  for leases with a term of twelve months or less or for low-value  assets. In these cases, the lease payments are instead expensed  over the lease term. Extension options are included in the lease  term if their exercise is reasonably certain. The accounting pol- icy choice for the non-separation of lease components and  non-lease components is used, with the exemption for vehicle  leases, and all components are accounted for as lease compo- nents. Right-of-use assets are meas­ ured at acquisition costs  less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, and are  depreciated under the straight-line method over the shorter of  the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. Lease  liabilities are meas­ ured at the present value of the lease pay- ments payable over the lease term, generally discounted using  the incremental borrowing rate.

If the\neffect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by\ndiscounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax interest\nrate that corresponds to the risk-free market interest rate.\n\nSignificant accounting estimates are required to determine\nprovisions related to onerous contracts with customers, war-\nranty costs and asset retirement obligations, as well as those\nrelated to legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental\ninvestigations (hereinafter, collectively, “legal proceedings”).\nSiemens Healthineers recognizes a provision for onerous con-\ntracts with customers when the estimated unavoidable costs of\noutstanding goods and services exceed the expected outstand-\ning revenue. Legal proceedings often involve complex legal is-\nsues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly,\nconsiderable judgment is required to determine whether it is\nprobable that there is a present obligation event at the end\nof the reporting period as a result of a past, whether a future\noutflow of resources is probable and whether the amount of\nthe obligation can be estimated reliably. Internal and external\ncounsels are generally part of the determination process for\nlegal proceedings.

Legal proceedings may have a material ef-\nfect on net assets, financial position and results of operations.\n\n51\n\nDefined benefit plans\n\nSiemens Healthineers measures entitlements from defined\nbenefit plans by applying the projected unit credit method.\nThereby, the obligation from defined benefit plans reflects an\nactuarially calculated present value of the future benefit entitle-\nment for services already rendered (defined benefit obligation,\nDBO). Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including\ndiscount rates, expected compensation increases and pension\nprogression and mortality rates. Discount rates are determined\nby reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of ap-\npropriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting\nperiod. High-quality corporate bonds have an issuing volume\nof more than 100 million units (in the respective currency) and\nan AA rating (or equivalent) by at least one of the three rating\nagencies Moody’s Investors Service, S & P Global Ratings or\nFitch Ratings. In such case that yields are not available, dis-\ncount rates are based on government bond yields. For signifi-\ncant plans, individual spot rates from a full yield curve approach\nare applied in general. Due to changing market, economic and\nsocial conditions, the underlying actuarial assumptions may\ndiffer from actual developments.\n\nFor funded plans, Siemens Healthineers offsets the fair value\nof the plan assets with the defined benefit obligation. The net\namount is presented, after adjustments for any effects relating\nto asset ceiling.\n\nCurrent and past service cost, settlement gains and losses for\npensions and similar obligations and administration costs unre-\njated to the management of plan assets are allocated to func-\ntional costs. Thereby, past service cost and settlement gains\nand losses are recognized immediately in net income. Current\nservice cost and interest income and expenses are determined\nased on the assumptions used for the calculation of the de-\nined benefit obligation as of the reporting date of the previous\niscal year, and recognized in profit or loss. Net interest is thus\ncalculated by multiplying the discount rate for the respective\niscal year by the net defined benefit asset or liability from de-\nined benefit plans as of the reporting date of the previous fiscal\nyear. As of the reporting date, remeasurements are recognized\nin other comprehensive income. These comprise actuarial gains\nand losses as well as the difference between the return on plan\nassets and the interest income on plan assets, which is included\nin net interest.\n\nEntitlements resulting from plans based on investment returns\nof underlying assets are generally measured at the fair value\nof the underlying assets as of the reporting date. If the per-\nformance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed\nreturn, the DBO is measured by projecting forward the contri-\nbutions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back\nto a present value.\n", "vlm_text": "\nProvisions \nA provision is recognized if all of the following conditions are  met: (1) it is probable that ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers has a present  legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, (2) it  is probable that an outflow of resources with economic bene- fits will be required to settle the obligation, and (3) a reliable  estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the  effect is material, provisions are recognized at present value by  discounting the expected future cash flows at a pretax interest  rate that corresponds to the risk-free market interest rate. \nSignificant accounting estimates are required to determine  provisions related to onerous contracts with customers, war- ranty costs and asset retirement obligations, as well as those  related to legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental  investigations (hereinafter, collectively, “legal proceedings”).  Siemens ­ Healthineers recognizes a provision for onerous con- tracts with customers when the estimated unavoidable costs of  outstanding goods and services exceed the expected outstand- ing revenue. Legal proceedings often involve complex legal is- sues and are subject to substantial uncertainties. Accordingly,  considerable judgment is required to determine whether it is  probable that there is a present obligation event at the end  of the reporting period as a result of a past, whether a future  outflow of resources is probable and whether the amount of  the obligation can be estimated reliably. Internal and external  counsels are generally part of the determination process for  legal proceedings. Due to new developments, it may be neces- sary to recognize a provision for an ongoing legal proceeding  or to adjust the amount of a previously recognized provision.  Upon resolution of a legal proceeding, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers  may incur charges in excess of the provision recognized for the  matter concerned. Legal proceedings may have a material ef- fect on net assets, financial position and results of operations. \nDefined benefit plans \nSiemens ­ Healthineers meas­ ures entitlements from defined  benefit plans by applying the projected unit credit method.  Thereby, the obligation from defined benefit plans reflects an  actuarially calculated present value of the future benefit entitle- ment for services already rendered (defined benefit obligation,  DBO). Actuarial valuations rely on key assumptions including  discount rates, expected compensation increases and pension  progression and mortality rates. Discount rates are determined  by reference to yields on high-quality corporate bonds of ap- propriate duration and currency at the end of the reporting  period. High-quality corporate bonds have an issuing volume  of more than 100 million units (in the respective currency) and  an AA rating (or equivalent) by at least one of the three rating  agencies Moody’s Investors Service, S & P Global Ratings or  Fitch Ratings. In such case that yields are not available, dis- count rates are based on government bond yields. For signifi- cant plans, individual spot rates from a full yield curve approach  are applied in general. Due to changing market, economic and  social conditions, the underlying actuarial assumptions may  differ from actual developments. \nFor funded plans, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers offsets the fair value  of the plan assets with the defined benefit obligation. The net  amount is presented, after adjustments for any effects relating  to asset ceiling. \nCurrent and past service cost, settlement gains and losses for  pensions and similar obligations and administration costs unre - lated to the management of plan assets are allocated to func- tional costs. Thereby, past service cost and settlement gains  and losses are recognized immediately in net income. Current  service cost and interest income and expenses are determined  based on the assumptions used for the calculation of the de- fined benefit obligation as of the reporting date of the previous  fiscal year, and recognized in profit or loss. Net interest is thus  calculated by multiplying the discount rate for the respective  fiscal year by the net defined benefit asset or liability from de- fined benefit plans as of the reporting date of the previous fiscal  year. As of the reporting date, remeas­ urements are recognized  in other comprehensive income. These comprise actuarial gains  and losses as well as the difference between the return on plan  assets and the interest income on plan assets, which is included  in net interest. \nEntitlements resulting from plans based on investment returns  of underlying assets are generally meas­ ured at the fair value  of the underlying assets as of the reporting date. If the per- formance of the underlying assets is lower than a guaranteed  return, the DBO is meas­ ured by projecting forward the contri- butions at the guaranteed fixed return and discounting back  to a present value.

These intangible assets mainly relate to\ntechnologies for oncology solutions, customer relationships,\nand the acquired order backlog. Goodwill relates to inseparable\nintangible assets such as synergy effects and employee know-\nhow. Synergies from the acquisition are mainly expected from\nbroader regional coverage of the sales network, cross-selling\nopportunities into our existing customer base and from ex-\npanded integrated service offerings (e.g. “Oncology-as-a-\nService” program) and value partnerships, and joint product\ninnovation. In addition, the merger of the two businesses is\n\n54\n\nexpected to generate cost synergies in the administrative field\nand in procurement activities.\n\nThe goodwill was allocated to the Varian and Imaging segments\nin accordance with the expected synergies from the acquisition.\nThe Imaging segment accounted for €532 million.\n\nThe fair value of trade and other receivables amounted to\n€579 million. This comprised of the gross contractual amount\nof €603 million, of which €24 million were expected to be un-\ncollectable at the date of acquisition. The fair value of loans\nreceivable and bonds amounted to €20 million. This comprised\nof the gross contractual amount of €227 million, of which\n€207 million were assessed as probably uncollectible at the ac-\nquisition date (please also see > Note 25 Financial instruments\n\nand hedging activities).\n\nThe acquired business contributed revenue of €1,241 mil-\nlion and a net loss of €50 million, including earnings effects\nfrom the purchase price allocation and integration costs to\nSiemens Healthineers for the period from the acquisition date to\nSeptember 30, 2021. Therein, pre-tax earnings effects from the\npurchase price allocation and integration costs of €380 million\nare included. If Varian had been included in the consolidated\nfinancial statements since October 1, 2020, revenue and net\nincome, including earnings effects from the purchase price allo-\ncation and integration costs, would have been € 19,332 million\nand €1,614 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe purchase price allocation of Varian is still preliminary, in\nparticular, the allocation of intangible assets including goodwill\nto currency areas is not yet finalized.

Here's a summary:\n\n**Assets:**\n- Cash and cash equivalents: €552\n- Trade and other receivables: €579\n- Other current financial assets: €95\n- Contract assets: €141\n- Inventories: €764\n- Other current assets: €114\n- Goodwill: €8,027\n- Other intangible assets: €6,285\n- Property, plant, and equipment: €525\n- Miscellaneous assets: €192\n\n**Total assets:** €17,273\n\n**Liabilities:**\n- Trade payables: €231\n- Other current financial liabilities: €80\n- Contract liabilities: €713\n- Current income tax liabilities: €181\n- Other current liabilities: €273\n- Long-term financial debt: €86\n- Deferred tax liabilities: €1,566\n- Miscellaneous liabilities: €284\n\n**Total liabilities:** €3,413\n\n**Non-controlling interests:** €6\nThe majority of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill  and intangible assets. These intangible assets mainly relate to  technologies for oncology solutions, customer relationships,  and the acquired order backlog. Goodwill relates to inseparable  intangible assets such as synergy effects and employee know- how. Synergies from the acquisition are mainly expected from  broader regional coverage of the sales network, cross-selling  opportunities into our existing customer base and from ex- panded integrated service offerings (e.  g. “Oncology-as-a-­ Service” program) and value partnerships, and joint product  innovation. In addition, the merger of the two businesses is  expected to generate cost synergies in the administrative field  and in procurement activities. \n\nThe goodwill was allocated to the Varian and Imaging segments  in accordance with the expected synergies from the acquisition.  The Imaging segment accounted for   $\\epsilon532$   million. \nThe fair value of trade and other receivables amounted to   $\\epsilon579$   million. This comprised of the gross contractual amount  of  $\\epsilon603$   million, of which  $\\epsilon24$   million were expected to be un- collectable at the date of acquisition. The fair value of loans  receivable and bonds amounted to  $\\tt E20$   million. This comprised  of the gross contractual amount of   $\\epsilon227$   million, of which   $\\notin207$   million were assessed as probably uncollectible at the ac- quisition date (please also see   $\\rightarrow$  Note 25    Financial instruments  and hedging activities ). \nThe acquired business contributed revenue of   $\\mathsf{\\xi}\\,{\\mathsf{1}}\\,,\\mathsf{241}\\ \\mathsf{m i l}$  - lion and a net loss of   $\\in\\!50$   million, including earnings effects  from the purchase price allocation and integration costs to  Siemens ­ Healthineers for the period from the acquisition date to  September 30, 2021. Therein, pre-tax earnings effects from the  purchase price allocation and integration costs of  $\\notin\\exists80$   million  are included. If Varian had been included in the consolidated  financial statements since October 1, 2020, revenue and net  income, including earnings effects from the purchase price allo- cation and integration costs, would have been  $\\not\\in{19,332}$   million  and € 1,614 million, respectively, in fiscal year 2021. \nThe purchase price allocation of Varian is still preliminary, in  particular, the allocation of intangible assets including goodwill  to currency areas is not yet finalized. Adjustments may lead to  changes, such as, in intangible assets including goodwill and  in deferred tax liabilities. \nFor information on financing and capital increases correspond- ing to the acquisition of Varian, refer to   $\\rightarrow$    Note 16    Financial  debt,    $\\rightarrow$    Note 23    Equity  and   $\\rightarrow$  Note 25    Financial instruments and  hedging activities . \nNote 4   Other operating income \nIn fiscal year 2021, an amount of  $\\epsilon\\,\\uparrow\\,\\uparrow$   million (2020: € 34 million)  was reported in other operating income in the United States in  connection with the CARES Act to mitigate the financial impact  of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Provisions for warranties related  to goods sold. Provisions for order-related losses and risks were  primarily recognized for contracts in which the unavoidable  costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceeded  expected outstanding revenue. Other provisions included var- ious types of provisions, such as for legal proceedings or asset  retirement obligations related to certain items of property, plant  and equipment. The line item other mainly related to additions  due to acquisitions. \nIn the ordinary course of business, ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers is in- volved in legal proceedings in various jurisdictions. At present,  the Group does not expect any matters from these legal proceed- ings to have material effects on net assets, financial position and  results of operations. "}

Based on this evaluation, valuation allowances for\nthese items were recognized. The carrying amounts of the items\nnet of valuation allowances approximated their fair values.\nThe carrying amount of liabilities to the Siemens Group from\nU.S. dollar denominated long-term loans was € 11,552 million\nas of September 30, 2021 (September 30, 2020: €2,923 mil-\nlion). The fair value of these liabilities, which is based on\nprices provided by price service agencies (level 2), amounted\nto €11,768 million as of September 30, 2021 (September 30,\n2020: €3,173 million). The carrying amounts of the remaining\nliabilities to the Siemens Group approximated their fair value\nbecause the relevant interest rates approximated market in-\nterest rates.\nThe carrying amounts of other non-current financial liabilities\nmeasured at amortized cost approximated their fair value,\nwhich is determined by discounting the expected future cash\nflows using market interest rates.\n* The determination of the fair values of derivatives depended\non the specific type of instrument. The fair values of forward\nexchange contracts were based on forward exchange rates\n(level 2). Options were generally valued based on quoted\nmarket prices or based on option pricing models (level 2).\nIn connection with the acquisition of Varian (please also see\n> Note 3 Acquisitions), Siemens Healthineers entered into a\ndeal contingent forward with a nominal amount of €7,500 mil-\nlion, which was linked to the actual closing of the acquisition.\nAs of September 30, 2020, the fair value of this deal contin-\ngent forward was generally based on observable market data\nsuch as forward exchange rates, interest curves and volatil-\nities. In addition, the value of the contingency element was\ntaken into account, which depended on expectations about\nthe occurrence and the timing of the closing (level 3). Upon\nclosing of the acquisition, the deal contingent forward was\nsettled and hedge accounting was discontinued. The effective\nportion of changes in the fair value of the deal contingent\nforward of €—90 million was reclassified from the cash flow\nhedge reserve and considered when determining the costs of\nthe acquisition. The ineffective portion of €-89 million was\nrecognized in other financial income, net.\n\nExcept for publicly listed investments for which a quoted\n\nprice in an active market exists (level 1), the fair values of\n\nventure capital investments were generally determined on\nthe basis of prices from most recently executed financing\nrounds (level 3). The fair values of other equity instruments\nwere generally derived from a discounted cash flow valu-\nation (level 3). Expected cash flows are thereby subject to\nfuture market and business developments as well as price\n\n72\n\nvolatility. The discount rates applied take into account respec-\ntive risk-adjusted capital costs. The fair value measurement\nof fund shares was based on their net asset values (level 2).\nDebt instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\nconsisted mainly of bonds and loans related to the financing\nof proton therapy centers in the Varian segment. In this con-\ntext, Siemens Healthineers, along with other debt investors,\nprovided funds to various entities that are used for the devel-\nopment, construction and operation of proton therapy cen-\nters, primarily in the United States. The repayment is either\ndirectly or indirectly linked to the commercial success of the\ncenters. The fair values of the bonds are based on comparable\nbond issues, broker and dealer quotations for the same or\nsimilar investments in active markets, and other observable\ninputs such as yields, credit risks, default rates, and volatili-\nties (level 2). The fair values of the loans are primarily based\non parameters such as the individual creditworthiness of\nthe debtor and the risk characteristics and operating perfor-\nmance of the financed project (level 3). Where appropriate, a\nprobability weighted expected return model is used, utilizing\nmanagement's assumptions of different outcomes such as\nthe sale, refinancing or closure of the therapy center. Credit\nratings are taken into account when adjusting the fair values\nfor credit risks. Consequently, a better rating will generally\nresult in an increased fair value of the loan receivable. As\nof September 30, 2021, the carrying amounts of financings\nprovided by Siemens Healthineers and measured at fair value\nthrough profit or loss were €22 million, while the total un-\ndiscounted amount, including accrued interest, amounted\nto €160 million. In addition, the carrying amounts of trade\nreceivables and contract assets related to the proton therapy\ncenters amounted to €10 million. The carrying amounts rep-\nresent the maximum exposure to loss.\n\nThe fair values of contingent consideration were derived from\nprobability-weighted future payments, which mainly depend\non the achievement of technical and commercial milestones as\nwell as on the achievement of revenue targets during the earn-\nout period (level 3). If the estimated revenues or probabilities\nof completing certain milestones increase or decrease during\nthe respective earn-out period, the fair value of the contingent\nconsideration would increase or decrease, respectively.\nLiabilities from written put options on non-controlling in-\nterests were measured at fair value, which is based on the\npresent value of the exercise price of the options (level 3).\nThe exercise price is generally derived from the proportionate\nenterprise value. The liabilities resulted mainly from written\nput options in connection with interests in ECG Management\nConsultants (hereinafter “ECG”). The enterprise value of ECG\nis calculated by an independent appraiser in accordance with\na contractually agreed methodology and serves as a basis for\nthe exercise price per share, which is determined at least once\nayear. The most significant unobservable input used to deter-\nmine the fair value is financial information from the five-year\nbusiness plan, which is mainly subject to expected business\nand market developments. In addition, weighted revenue and\nearnings multiples are considered. Changes resulting from\nthe revaluation of liabilities from written put options were\nrecognized in retained earnings.\n", "vlm_text": "•\t  The   carrying   amounts   of   the   items   cash   and   cash   equivalents ,  short-term   and   current   maturities   of   long-term   financial   debt ,  trade   payables ,  current   liabilities   to   the   Siemens   Group   and   other   current   financial   assets   and   other   current   financial   li- abilities   meas­ ured   at   amortized   cost   approximated   their   fair   value   due   to   the   short-term   maturities   of   these   instruments.\n\n •\t  Trade   receivables ,  receivables   from   finance   leases ,  current   receivables   from   the   Siemens   Group   and   other   non-current   financial   assets   meas­ ured   at   amortized   cost   were   evaluated   taking   into   account   various   parameters ,  such   as   interest   rates ,  country-specific   risks   and   the   individual   credit worthiness   of   the   debtors.

Credit   ratings   are   taken   into   account   when   adjusting   the   fair   values   for   credit   risks.   Consequently ,  a   better   rating   will   generally   result   in   an   increased   fair   value   of   the   loan   receivable.   As   of   September  30, 2021,  the   carrying   amounts   of   financings   provided   by   Siemens   Healthineers   and   meas­ ured   at   fair   value   through   profit   or   loss   were  $\\epsilon22$    million ,  while   the   total   un- discounted   amount ,  including   accrued   interest ,  amounted   to    $\\in\\!160$    million.   In   addition ,  the   carrying   amounts   of   trade   receivables   and   contract   assets   related   to   the   proton   therapy   centers   amounted   to  $\\in\\!10$    million.   The   carrying   amounts   rep- resent   the   maximum   exposure   to   loss.\n\n \n•\t  The   fair   values   of   contingent   consideration   were   derived   from   probability-weighted   future   payments ,  which   mainly   depend   on   the   achievement   of   technical   and   commercial   milestones   as   well   as   on   the   achievement   of   revenue   targets   during   the   earn- out   period   (level   3).   If   the   estimated   revenues   or   probabilities   of   completing   certain   milestones   increase   or   decrease   during   the   respective   earn-out   period ,  the   fair   value   of   the   contingent   consideration   would   increase   or   decrease ,  respectively.\n\n \n•\t  Liabilities   from   written   put   options   on   non-controlling   in- terests   were   meas­ ured   at   fair   value ,  which   is   based   on   the   present   value   of   the   exercise   price   of   the   options   (level   3).   The   exercise   price   is   generally   derived   from   the   proportionate   enterprise   value.   The   liabilities   resulted   mainly   from   written   put   options   in   connection   with   interests   in   ECG   Management   Consultants   (hereinafter   “ECG”).   The   enterprise   value   of   ECG   is   calculated   by   an   independent   appraiser   in   accordance   with   a   contractually   agreed   methodology   and   serves   as   a   basis   for   the   exercise   price   per   share ,  which   is   determined   at   least   once   a   year.   The   most   significant   unobservable   input   used   to   deter- mine   the   fair   value   is   financial   information   from   the   five-year   business   plan ,  which   is   mainly   subject   to   expected   business   and   market   developments.   In   addition ,  weighted   revenue   and   earnings   multiples   are   considered.   Changes   resulting   from   the   revaluation   of   liabilities   from   written   put   options   were   recognized   in   retained   earnings. "}

{"page": 96, "image_path": "page_images/siemens-healthineers_2021_96.jpg", "ocr_text": "Siemens Healthineers Annual Report 2021\nAdditional information — Independent auditor's report\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter:\nThe Group’s revenue stems from the sale of imaging, diagnos-\ntics and therapy products and related maintenance and other\nservices. In fiscal year 2021, significant additional revenue re-\nsulted from the sale of rapid COVID-19 antigen tests. Financial\nmanagement and measurement of the operating results of\nthe segments is based on comparable revenue growth and ad-\njusted EBIT-margin. The development of these key performance\nindicators is primarily determined by the amount of revenue\nrecognized. In view of the materiality of revenue and its signif-\nicance for the financial management of the Group, we consider\nrevenue recognition to be an area posing a significant risk of\nmaterial misstatement (including the potential risk of managers\ncircumventing controls) and one of the key audit matters.\n\nAuditor’s response: As part of our audit, we identified all sig-\nnificant revenue streams subject to different processes, risks\nand controls. For these revenue streams we assessed the dif-\nferent revenue recognition processes and the effectiveness\nof the accounting-related internal control system in relation\nto revenue recognition. We planned the nature, timing and\nscope of substantive audit procedures according to our indi-\nvidual assessment of the risk inherent in the different reve-\nnue streams. Our substantive procedures primarily involved\nanalyses of disaggregated data to determine whether there\nare any unexpected discrepancies between revenue, cost of\nsales and trade receivables or contract assets, or any signifi-\ncant or extraordinary changes in key performance indicators\n(e.g., revenue or gross profit). We also performed correlation\nanalyses and cut-off analyses of revenue transactions around\nthe reporting date. We supplemented data analytics with sam-\nple testing specifically focusing on revenues for imaging and\ntherapy products as well as revenues related to the sale of rapid\nCOVID-19 antigen tests and assessed the amount and timing\nof revenue recognized on the basis of contracts, invoices and\ndelivery notes. As part of these procedures, we also obtained\nexternal customer confirmations and reviewed credit notes\nissued after the reporting date.\n\nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating\nto the recognition of revenue from the sale of products and the\nprovision of services.\n\nReference to related disclosures: With regard to the recognition\nand measurement policies applied for the recognition of rev-\nenue, refer to Note 2 Accounting policies in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nRecoverability of goodwill and capitalized development costs\nReasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter:\nTesting impairment for goodwill and capitalized development\ncosts involves considerable judgment in estimating future cash\nflows and discount rates. Estimation uncertainty in relation to\nfuture net cash flows exists also due to the impact of COVID-19\npandemic. Consequently, the recoverability of goodwill and\ncapitalized development costs was one of the key audit matters.\n\n95\n\nAuditor's response: To assess the recoverable amounts of good-\nwill and capitalized development costs determined by manage-\nment, we examined the underlying processes. We obtained an\nunderstanding of the underlying valuation models used to\ndetermine the recoverable amounts by verifying the applied\nmethodology and arithmetical correctness. To assess estimates\nof future net cash flows, we reconciled approved budgets with\nthe valuations provided to us.

In fiscal year 2021, significant additional revenue re- sulted from the sale of rapid COVID-19 antigen tests. Financial  management and meas­ urement of the operating results of  the segments is based on comparable revenue growth and ad- justed EBIT-margin. The development of these key performance  indicators is primarily determined by the amount of revenue  recognized. In view of the materiality of revenue and its signif- icance for the financial management of the Group, we consider  revenue recognition to be an area posing a significant risk of  material misstatement (including the potential risk of managers  circumventing controls) and one of the key audit matters. \nAuditor’s response:  As part of our audit, we identified all sig- nificant revenue streams subject to different processes, risks  and controls. For these revenue streams we assessed the dif- ferent revenue recognition processes and the effectiveness  of the accounting-related internal control system in relation  to revenue recognition. We planned the nature, timing and  scope of substantive audit procedures according to our indi- vidual assessment of the risk inherent in the different reve- nue streams. Our substantive procedures primarily involved  analyses of disaggregated data to determine whether there  are any unexpected discrepancies between revenue, cost of  sales and trade receivables or contract assets, or any signifi- cant or extraordinary changes in key performance indicators  (e.  g., revenue or gross profit). We also performed correlation  analyses and cut-off analyses of revenue transactions around  the reporting date. We supplemented data analytics with sam- ple testing specifically focusing on revenues for imaging and  therapy products as well as revenues related to the sale of rapid  COVID-19 antigen tests and assessed the amount and timing  of revenue recognized on the basis of contracts, invoices and  delivery notes. As part of these procedures, we also obtained  external customer confirmations and reviewed credit notes  issued after the reporting date. \nAuditor’s response:  To assess the recoverable amounts of good- will and capitalized development costs determined by manage- ment, we examined the underlying processes. We obtained an  understanding of the underlying valuation models used to  determine the recoverable amounts by verifying the applied  methodology and arithmetical correctness. To assess estimates  of future net cash flows, we reconciled approved budgets with  the valuations provided to us. We also examined whether the  budget reflects general, industry and product-specific mar- ket expectations, including potential COVID-19 impacts. We  performed a budget-to-actual comparison of historically fore- casted data and actual results, where available, on a sample  basis to assess forecast accuracy. We examined the inputs used  to estimate recoverable amounts, such as the estimated growth  rates and the discount rates, by comparing them with publicly  available market data and assessing them in light of changes in  key assumptions, including future market conditions. \nWe also performed sensitivity analyses to assess the impairment  risk in case of changes in significant assumptions. In addition,  we analyzed the disclosures in the notes to the consolidated fi- nancial statements on the meas­ urement of goodwill in relation  to the requirements of IAS 36. We consulted internal valuation  specialists to assess the recoverable amounts. \nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating  to the recoverability of goodwill and capitalized development  costs. \nReference to related disclosures:  With regard to the testing of  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, including  capitalized development costs, refer to   $\\rightarrow$    Note 2   ­ Accounting  policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. For  explanatory notes on goodwill and other intangible assets, refer  to the disclosures in   $\\rightarrow$  Note 12    Goodwill  and   $\\rightarrow$    Note 13    Other  intangible assets and property, plant and ­ equipment  in the notes  to the consolidated financial statements. \nOur audit procedures did not lead to any reservations relating  to the recognition of revenue from the sale of products and the  provision of services. \nReference to related disclosures:  With regard to the recognition  and meas­ urement policies applied for the recognition of rev- enue, refer to   $\\rightarrow$    Note 2    Accounting policies  in the notes to the  consolidated financial statements. \nRecoverability of goodwill and capitalized development costs Reasons why the matter was determined to be a key audit matter: Testing impairment for goodwill and capitalized development  costs involves considerable judgment in estimating future cash  flows and discount rates. Estimation uncertainty in relation to  future net cash flows exists also due to the impact of COVID-19  pandemic. Consequently, the recoverability of goodwill and  capitalized development costs was one of the key audit ­ matters. "}

It conducts a pre-examination of the annual  financial statements of ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG, the consol- idated financial statements, and the combined management  report, as well as the report on relationships with affiliated com- panies. On the basis of the independent auditors’ report on their  audit of the financial statements, the Audit Committee makes,  after its own pre-examination, recommendations regarding  the Supervisory Board’s approval of the annual financial state- ments of ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG and the consolidated finan- cial statements. The Audit Committee discusses the quarterly  statements and half-year financial report with the Managing  Board and the independent auditors and deals with the audi- tors’ reports on the review of the Group’s half-year consolidated  financial statements and interim management report. It con- cerns itself with questions of risk management and oversees the  suitability and effectiveness of the systems for internal control,  risk management, and internal auditing. The Audit Committee  receives regular reports from the internal audit department.  It prepares the Supervisory Board’s recommendation to the  Annual Shareholders’ Meeting concerning the election of the  independent auditors and submits the corresponding proposal  to the Supervisory Board. Once the Annual Shareholders’ Meet - ing has made a resolution, the Audit Committee awards the  audit contract to the independent auditors and monitors the  independent audit of the financial statements, particularly the  selection, independence, and qualification of the auditors. It  evaluates the quality of the audit and the work of the indepen- dent auditors, including the additional services they provide. In  this regard, the committee complies with the applicable legal  requirements, including in particular the requirements under  the EU Audit Regulation (Regulation (EU) No. 537  /  2014 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on  specific requirements of statutory audits of public-interest en- tities and repealing Commission Decision 2005  /  909  /  EC). The  Audit Committee furthermore concerns itself with monitoring  compliance, and with nonfinancial reporting and exemptions  from such reporting. \nIn fiscal year 2021, the Audit Committee had the following  members: Dr. Marion Helmes (Chairwoman since September 28,  2021), Dr. Andreas C. Hoffmann (Chairman until September 27,  2021) and Prof. Dr. Ralf P. Thomas. "}

The chair of the Managing Board is involved,\nunless the discussion is about his or her own succession. The\nrequirement profiles for future Managing Board members de-\nfined by the Supervisory Board are not static, but are reviewed\nat the start of every new succession-planning project, taking\ninto account the current responsibility-specific needs and con-\ncrete challenges. The Supervisory Board pursues the approved\ndiversity concept in this process, giving due consideration to\nensuring that the knowledge, abilities, and experience of all\nmembers of the Managing Board are diverse and balanced. In\naddition, the Supervisory Board regularly receives information\non succession planning for the level below the Managing Board\nand advises the Managing Board on this matter.

This\nframework requires the composition of the Supervisory Board\nof Siemens Healthineers AG to be such as to ensure that its\nmembers collectively are qualified to supervise and advise the\nManaging Board.\n\nTargets for female representation on\n\nthe Supervisory Board\n\nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory\nBoard is to set a target for the share of women on the Super-\nvisory Board. If the share of women is less than 30% when\nthe target is set, the target cannot be below the level that has\nalready been achieved.\n\nAt Siemens Healthineers AG, a target of at least 2/9 by June 30,\n2023, has been set for female representation on the Super-\nvisory Board.\n\nThere are already two women on the Supervisory Board:\nDr. Marion Helmes and Dr. Nathalie von Siemens. Thus, the\ntarget for female representation had already been achieved\nwhen the decision was taken — by a broad majority at the An-\nnual Shareholders’ Meeting 2021 — to enlarge the Supervisory\nBoard. As a consequence of the enlargement of the Supervisory\n\nBoard and the election of the new member, the Company has\ntemporarily fallen short of its target for female representation.\nThe next regular election of the majority of Supervisory Board\nmembers is planned for the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 2023,\nwhich is prior to the deadline for achieving the envisaged tar-\nget for female representation. Consequently, the election may\nresult in the Company achieving its target.\n\nDiversity concept for the Supervisory Board\nSufficient diversity is expected in the composition of the Super-\nvisory Boardthat the Supervisory Board is sufficiently diverse in\nits composition. In addition to an appropriate gender ratio, this\nalso includes diversity with regard to cultural origin, religion,\nand ethnic background, as well as diversity of professional back-\nground, experience, and mindset. When examining potential\ncandidates for appointments to Supervisory Board positions,\ndiversity should be given appropriate consideration early on in\nthe selection process.\n\nIn the process of selecting and nominating candidates for the\nSupervisory Board, the Supervisory Board takes account of the\ntargets for its composition and the requirements laid down in\nthe diversity concept.\n\nThese requirements were taken into account when a new mem-\nber was elected to the Supervisory Board during the report-\ning period. In selecting Mr. Peer M. Schatz, special attention\nwas paid to his international professional experience and his\ncross-cultural origins and education.\n\nProfile of required skills and expertise\n\nThe composition of the Supervisory Board of Siemens\nHealthineers AG should be such that it can provide the Manag-\ning Board with qualified oversight and consultation.\n\nThe candidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board\nshould have the knowledge, skills, and experience that enable\nthem to perform the duties of a supervisory board member at\nan international enterprise and strengthen the public image of\nSiemens Healthineers. The character, integrity, motivation, and\nprofessionalism of the persons proposed for election should be\ngiven particular consideration.\n\nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, at least one\nmember of the Supervisory Board should have knowledge\nof accounting and at least one further member should have\nknowledge of auditing financial statements. In addition, the\nSupervisory Board should collectively be familiar with the sec-\ntor in which Siemens Healthineers operates.\n\nPursuant to the GCGC, the Chair of the Audit Committee should\nhave specific knowledge and experience in applying account-\ning principles and internal control procedures and be familiar\nwith audits of financial statements.

The appoint- ment of incumbents of certain management functions at the  first level below the Managing Board requires the approval of  the Chairman’s Committee. \nC.4.3  \u0007 Tasks of the Supervisory Board;  targets, profile of required skills  and expertise, and diversity  concept \nThe diversity concept for the Supervisory Board was adopted  by the Supervisory Board together with the targets for the  Board’s own composition, including the profile of the skills  and expertise that the Supervisory Board should possess. This  framework requires the composition of the Supervisory Board  of ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG to be such as to ensure that its  members collectively are qualified to supervise and advise the  Managing Board. \nTargets for female representation on   the Supervisory Board \nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, the Supervisory  Board is to set a target for the share of women on the Super- visory Board. If the share of women is less than   $30\\,\\%$   when  the target is set, the target cannot be below the level that has  already been achieved. \nAt ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers AG, a target of at least 2  /  9 by June 30,  2023, has been set for female representation on the Super­ visory Board. \nThere are already two women on the Supervisory Board:  Dr. Marion Helmes and Dr. Nathalie von ­ Siemens. Thus, the  target for female representation had already been achieved  when the decision was taken – by a broad majority at the An- nual Shareholders’ Meeting 2021 – to enlarge the Supervisory  Board. As a consequence of the enlargement of the Supervisory  Board and the election of the new member, the Company has  temporarily fallen short of its target for female representation.  The next regular election of the majority of Supervisory Board  members is planned for the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting 2023,  which is prior to the deadline for achieving the envisaged tar- get for female representation. Consequently, the election may  result in the Company achieving its target. \n\nDiversity concept for the Supervisory Board \nSufficient diversity is expected in the composition of the Super- visory Boardthat the Supervisory Board is sufficiently diverse in  its composition. In addition to an appropriate gender ratio, this  also includes diversity with regard to cultural origin, religion,  and ethnic background, as well as diversity of professional back- ground, experience, and mindset. When examining potential  candidates for appointments to Supervisory Board positions,  diversity should be given appropriate consideration early on in  the selection process. \nIn the process of selecting and nominating candidates for the  Supervisory Board, the Supervisory Board takes account of the  targets for its composition and the requirements laid down in  the diversity concept. \nThese requirements were taken into account when a new mem- ber was elected to the Supervisory Board during the report- ing period. In selecting Mr. Peer M. Schatz, special attention  was paid to his international professional experience and his  cross-cultural origins and education. \nProfile of required skills and expertise \nThe composition of the Supervisory Board of ­ Siemens  Healthineers AG should be such that it can provide the Manag- ing Board with qualified oversight and consultation. \nThe candidates proposed for election to the Supervisory Board  should have the knowledge, skills, and experience that enable  them to perform the duties of a supervisory board member at  an international enterprise and strengthen the public image of  Siemens ­ Healthineers. The character, integrity, motivation, and  professionalism of the persons proposed for election should be  given particular consideration. \nPursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act, at least one  member of the Supervisory Board should have knowledge  of accounting and at least one further member should have  knowledge of auditing financial statements. In addition, the  Supervisory Board should collectively be familiar with the sec- tor in which ­ Siemens ­ Healthineers operates. \nPursuant to the GCGC, the Chair of the Audit Committee should  have specific knowledge and experience in applying account- ing principles and internal control procedures and be familiar  with audits of financial statements. This person should also be  independent. "}
