Additional\ncompetitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and\nwillingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer histories, more customers, greater brand\nrecognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue\nrestrictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with\nrestrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.

We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\n\nSeasonality\n\nOur business is affected by seasonality, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31.

We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory. \nWe generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. \nOur Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships \nWe provide e-commerce and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our websites. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offering is not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. \nAs our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. \nOur present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. \nOur Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments \nWe have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions (such as our acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as: \n• disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key personnel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; "}

In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently\nenacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact\ntax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make\nadjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are\nmade.\n\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in\nan audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of\nProposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign\nsubsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the\nIRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions\nundertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\nsignificant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax\nauthorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October\n4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on\nstate aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision\nto be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision.\nWhile the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes\nsubject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax\nestimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax\nprovisions and accruals.\n\nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks\n\nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services,\nmanufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee\navailability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop\nselling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier\nbankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in\na timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of\nstandards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our\ngrowth, and negatively affect our operating results.\n\n13\n", "vlm_text": "transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations, acquisitions (including integration s) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017 Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. \nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance, we may make adjustments to provisional amounts that we have recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. \nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and we have been contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately €250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. \nOur Supplier Relationships Subject Us to a Number of Risks \nWe have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results.

Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inventory as product sales and recognize our\nnet share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as service sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our businesses, through increased product selection,\nacross numerous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfillment, publishing, certain digital content\nsubscriptions, advertising, and co-branded credit cards.\n\nOur financial focus is on long-term, sustainable growth in free cash flows ' . Free cash flows are driven primarily by increasing operating income and\nefficiently managing working capital ? and cash capital expenditures, including our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating\nincome primarily result from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially offset by investments we make in\nlonger-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering\nprices, improving availability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories and service offerings, expanding\nproduct information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earning customer trust.\n\nWe seek to reduce our variable costs per unit and work to leverage our fixed costs. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing\nand related transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service support, costs necessary to run AWS, anda\nportion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our\nwebsites and web services, our electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment centers and physical stores. Variable costs\ngenerally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs generally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion,\nand other factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase\ndiscounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean\nculture.\n\n(1) See “Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for additional information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures.\n(2) Working capital consists of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable.\n\n19\n", "vlm_text": "Item 7.

The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the\nportrayal of the company’s financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often\nas a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and\njudgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to\nunderstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Description of Business and\nAccounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.\nActual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of December 31, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\nof sales of approximately $180 million.\n\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores.\nThese commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\n\nIncome Taxes\n\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for\nwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as intercompany transactions, the relative\namount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in\njurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, the applicability of special tax regimes, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the\nrelated tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes to our existing businesses and operations,\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments and how they are financed, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and\ntheir valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations. In addition, a\nnumber of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation\ncommonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “2017 Tax Act”). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the 2017\nTax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act significantly changes how the U.S. taxes corporations. The 2017 Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required in U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the 2017 Tax Act and significant estimates in\ncalculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other\nstandard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the 2017 Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our\ninterpretation.

Positive values indicate cash provided, while negative values (shown in parentheses) indicate cash used.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were  $\\S~19.8$   billion ,   $\\S26.0$   billion , and  $\\S31.0$   billion as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were  $\\S7.3$   billion ,  $\\S9.1$   billion , and  $\\S11.1$   billion , as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. \nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was  $\\S12.0$   billion ,  $\\S17.3$   billion , and \\$18.4 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivable s from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. The increase in operating cash flow in 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(6.5) billion , $(9.9)\nbillion , and $(27.8) billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property\nand equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities.

Proceeds from long-term debt and\nother were $353 million , $621 million , and $16.2 billion in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of net\nproceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August\n2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay the 1.200% Notes due November 2017,\nand for general corporate purposes.

The 2017 Tax Act includes a mandatory one-\ntime tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and as a result, all previously unremitted earnings for which no U.S. deferred tax liability had been\naccrued have now been subject to U.S. tax. Notwithstanding the U.S. taxation of these amounts, we intend to continue to invest most or all of these earnings, as\nwell as our capital in these subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. and do not expect to incur any significant, additional taxes related to such amounts. As of\nDecember 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $9.6 billion.\n\nWe have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our\nU.S. taxable income. The 2017 Tax Act extended through 2026 and enhanced the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property. Cash\ntaxes paid (net of refunds) were $273 million , $412 million , and $957 million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . As of December 31, 2017 , our federal net operating\nloss carryforward was approximately $226 million and we had approximately $855 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities.\nOur federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we\nexpect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.

Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-\ntax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,\nlowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign\nsubsidiaries as of 2017, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The 2017 Tax Act also enhanced and extended\nthrough 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. We have not completed our determination of the accounting\nimplications of the 2017 Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in\nour financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This\namount is primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax\nrate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time\ntax is not material. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S.\nTreasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact\nour provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\n\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $950 million , $1.4 billion , and $769 million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our provision for income taxes in 2016\nwas higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may\nrealize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances\nagainst the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit.\n\nOur provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisional\nfavorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related\ndevelopments.\n\nWe regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In\nperforming this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.

We have not completed our determination of the accounting implications of the 2017 Tax Act on our tax accruals. However, we have reasonably estimated the effects of the 2017 Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the 2017 Tax Act of approximately  $\\mathbb{S}789$   million. This amount is primarily comprised of the re measurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to   $21\\%$   from  $35\\%$  , after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax is not material. As we complete our analysis of the 2017 Tax Act, collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, we may make adjustments to the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. \nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of   $\\S950$   million ,  $\\S1.4$   billion , and  $\\S769$   million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Our provision for income taxes in 2016 was higher than in 2015 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may realize a tax benefit, an increase in tax amortization deductions, and a decline in the proportion of nondeductible expenses. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. \nOur provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the provisional favorable effect of the 2017 Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. \nWe regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.

However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Fixed income securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. \nThe following table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, including principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages): \nThe table provides an overview of an entity's financial securities and their estimated fair values as of December 31, 2017. The data is categorized by different types of securities (e.g., money market funds, corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency securities, etc.) and spans across several years from 2018 to 2022, along with a \"Thereafter\" column, indicating investments that mature beyond 2022. For each category, the table displays the amounts allocated for different maturity years along with the total amount and estimated fair value as of the end of 2017. Additionally, the table includes weighted-average interest rates for each category of investment.\n\nKey details:\n- \"Money market funds\" have a total amount and estimated fair value of $11,343 with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.61%.\n- \"Corporate debt securities\" have a total amount of $4,249 with an estimated fair value of $4,257, and a weighted-average interest rate of 1.93%.\n- \"U.S. government and agency securities\" have a total amount of $4,836 with an estimated fair value of $4,823, and a weighted-average interest rate of 1.69%.\n- \"Asset-backed securities\" have a total amount of $907 with an estimated fair value of $905, and a weighted-average interest rate of 2.11%.\n- \"Foreign government and agency securities\" have a total amount of $621 with an estimated fair value of $620, and a weighted-average interest rate of 1.81%.\n- \"Other securities\" have a total amount of $332 with an estimated fair value of $338, and a weighted-average interest rate of 1.62%.\n- The total cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities amount to $22,288, with an estimated fair value of $22,286."}

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused websites, and from www.amazon.ca and www.amazon.com.mx (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily\ndenominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding websites and primarily include Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds. The results of operations\nof, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused websites and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nUpon consolidation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant\ngains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the period compared\nto rates in effect the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $137 million in comparison with the prior year.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2017 , of $11.1 billion , an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$555 million, $1.1 billion, and $2.2 billion. All investments are classified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity.\n\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies.

We record our\nequity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded companies at fair value, which is subject to market price volatility, and represents $415 million of our\ninvestments as of December 31, 2017 . We evaluate our equity and equity warrant investments in private companies for impairment when events and\ncircumstances indicate that the decline in fair value of such assets below the carrying value is other-than-temporary. Our analysis includes a review of recent\noperating results and trends, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic climate provides\nadditional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data.

The revenue related to the deliverables is amortized over the life of the membership based on the\nestimated delivery of services. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service sales. Costs to deliver Amazon Prime benefits are\nrecognized as cost of sales as incurred. As we add more benefits to the Prime membership, we update the method of determining the estimated selling prices of\neach element as well as the allocation of Prime membership fees.\n\nWe evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally,\nwhen we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk, have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers, or have several but not\nall of these indicators, revenue is recorded at the gross sale price. We generally record the net amounts as commissions earned if we are not primarily obligated and\ndo not have latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are determined using fixed fees, a percentage of seller revenues, per-unit activity fees, or some\ncombination thereof.\n\nProduct sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Product sales\nand shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers.\nRetail sales to customers are made pursuant to a sales contract that provides for transfer of both title and risk of loss upon our delivery to the carrier or the\ncustomer. Amazon’s electronic devices sold through retailers are recognized at the point of sale to consumers.\n\nService sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, certain digital content subscriptions,\ncertain advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Service sales, net of promotional discounts and return allowances, are recognized when\nservice has been rendered.\n\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Allowance for returns was $153 million , $156 million\n\n, and $62 million as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 .

Such offers include current discount offers,\nsuch as percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such as offers for future discounts subject to a minimum current purchase, and other similar\noffers. Current discount offers, when accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction, while inducement offers,\nwhen accepted by our customers, are treated as a reduction to purchase price based on estimated future redemption rates.

Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories. \nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-can cell able commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We also have firm, non-can cell able commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores. \nAccounts Receivable, Net and Other \nIncluded in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, sellers, and vendors. As of December 31, 2016 and 2017 , customer receivable s, net, were  $\\S3.9$   billion and \\$6.4 billion , seller receivable s, net, were \\$661 million and \\$692 million , and vendor receivable s, net, were  $\\S2.0$   billion and   $\\S2.6$   billion . Seller receivable s are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. \nWe estimate losses on receivable s based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivable s are considered impaired and written-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was  $\\mathbb{S}189$   million ,   $\\S237$   million , and  $\\S348$   million as of December 31, 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . Additions to the allowance were  $\\S289$   million , \\$451 million , and  $\\S626$   million , and deductions to the allowance were  $\\S290$   million , \\$403 million , and  $\\S515$   million in 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . The allowance for loan losses related to our seller receivable s was not material as of December 31, 2016 and 2017 . \nInternal-Use Software and Website Development \nCosts incurred to develop software for internal use and our websites are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software  .  Costs related to design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. For the years ended 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 , we capitalized  $\\S642$   million (including  $\\S114$   million of stock-based compensation),   $\\S511$   million (including  $\\S94$   million of stock-based compensation), and  $\\S395$  million (including \\$84 million of stock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was \\$635 million ,  $\\S634$   million , and   $\\S545$   million for 2015 , 2016 , and 2017 . \nProperty and Equipment, Net \nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with "}

Equipment includes assets such as furniture and fixtures, heavy equipment,\nservers and networking equipment, and internal-use software and website development. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful\nlives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, two years for assets such as internal-use software, three years\nfor our servers, five years for networking equipment, five years for furniture and fixtures, and ten years for heavy equipment). Depreciation expense is classified\nwithin the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nLeases and Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe categorize leases at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other\nincentives. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of\nrequired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improvements are\ncapitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the\nconstruction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we\nassess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities\nare accounted for as finance leases.\n\nWe establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such\nassets are depreciated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement costs.\n\nGoodwill\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be\nrecoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of\na reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step\nimpairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the\nreporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a\nsecond step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate\nthe fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating\nexpenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions.\n\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2017, and determined that goodwill is no t\nimpaired as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no triggering events identified from the date of our assessment\nthrough December 31, 2017 that would require an update to our annual impairment test. See “Note 4—Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets.”\n\nOther Assets\n\nIncluded in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired intangible assets, net of amortization; video and\nmusic content, net of amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer than one year, the majority\nof which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets.\n\nVideo and Music Content\n\nWe obtain video and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which include both fixed and\nvariable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is\navailable for streaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability as payments are\nmade and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line basis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges\nfrom one to five years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We\nalso develop original content.

Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an\nasset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of\nan asset or group of assets may not be recoverable.\n\nFor long-lived assets used in operations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted,\nprobability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived\nassets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available for sale\nin its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.

The ASU defines\nnet realizable value as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.\nThe ASU is applicable to inventory that is accounted for under the first-in, first-out method. We adopted this ASU in QI 2017 with no material impact to our\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be\nrecognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. The inclusion of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as a component of our income tax\nexpense will increase volatility within our provision for income taxes as the amount of excess tax benefits or deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards\ndepends on our stock price at the date the awards vest. This guidance also requires excess tax benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of\ncash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. We adopted this\nASU in Q1 2017 by recording the cumulative impact through an increase in retained earnings of $687 million , and we will continue to estimate expected\nforfeitures.

We will adopt this ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2018 with a cumulative adjustment that will increase retained earnings by approximately $650 million rather than retrospectively adjusting prior\nperiods. The cumulative adjustment will primarily relate to unredeemed gift cards. We will begin to recognize revenue from estimated unredeemed gift cards over\nthe expected customer redemption period, which is substantially within nine months, rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of\nredemption becomes remote, generally two years from the date of issuance.

Upon adoption of the ASU,\nAmazon Prime memberships will be accounted for as a single performance obligation recognized ratably over the membership period and will be classified as\nservice sales.

If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant\nadditional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from\nJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties.

In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of\nproducts to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2010 commenced an\nappeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the\nAustrian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application of the\ntariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme\nCourt referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the conditions\nset by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed\nAustro-Mechana’s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher\nCommercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. In\nFebruary 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-\nMechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been filed making similar\nallegations.

In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.a r.1. in the Court of\nFirst Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In\nNovember 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a\ndetermination of damages.

The\ncomplaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December\n2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and\nhour statute.

As previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions undertaken in the\n2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that\nwould result in additional federal tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the\nissues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the\ntransactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed\non appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities.\n\nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. In\nSeptember 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign\njurisdictions. In June 2015, we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French taxes, interest, and penalties through September\n2012. In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the\nEuropean Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax\npaid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that\ndeterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and\nrecover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options,\nincluding an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated\nrecovery amount of approximately €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax\nauthorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including\ninterest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated\nrecovery amount announced by the European Commission.

The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. \nCertain of our subsidiaries were under examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration (“FTA”) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. In September 2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions. In June 2015, we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French taxes, interest, and penalties through September 2012. In December 2017, we settled this dispute with the FTA and included the impact thereof within our financial statements. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission’s guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. We may be required to fund into escrow an amount in excess of the estimated recovery amount announced by the European Commission. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, "}
