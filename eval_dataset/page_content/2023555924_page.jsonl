Introduction  \nIn Australia, each jurisdiction has regulations, policies, and procedures related to school bus  services and the requirements related to the safety and maintenance of buses (both generally and  specifically for school buses).  In some jurisdictions, school buses are procured and operated by  the government, while in others bus operators are contracted to provide school bus services, or  there may be a mix of both. In some cases, school buses are only provided in certain areas. For  example, school buses in Western Australia are mainly operated in “regional and remote” areas  and for students attending Education Support Facilities. In major metropolitan areas, students  travel at a concession fare rate on regular public transport.   \nState and territory rules may reference or implement certain national level laws or model laws.  In particular, all states and territories other than Western Australia and the Northern Territory  have enacted laws implementing the model Heavy Vehicle National Law and associated  regulations, which are administered by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator.  Other national  level instruments include the federal Road Vehicles Standards Act 2018 (Cth) 4  and Australian  Design Rules (ADRs).   5  The ADRs apply to new and imported vehicles,   6  but they are also  referenced in rules related to in-service vehicles. For example, the Heavy Vehicle (Vehicle  Standards) National Regulation contains provisions stating when a heavy vehicle must comply  with the ADRs, as well as various minimum requirements for such vehicles.

Safety Equipment Requirements\n\nA. Advanced Emergency Braking and Electronic Stability Control\n\nIn March 2022, the Australian government announced that two new ADRs mandating Advanced\nEmergency Braking (AEB) and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) for heavy vehicles would be\nintroduced.

For existing\nmodels already in circulation, the systems must be installed in new buses from November 1,\n2024.8 The following ADRs will apply:\n\ne ADR 97/00 - Advanced Emergency Braking (AEB) for Omnibuses, and Medium and\nHeavy Goods Vehicles.!°! This will require all goods vehicles and buses above 3.5T\nGVM to be equipped with AEB\n\ne ADR 35/07 - Commercial Vehicle Brake Systems.!!°l This ADR was revised to expand\nthe requirement of vehicle stability functions of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) and\nroll over control to cover all buses and goods vehicles above 3.5T GVM. The previous\nversion, ADR35/06, did not require ESC and anti-roll on goods vehicles not used as\nprime movers. This revision of ADR 35 was needed to support the adoption of\nADR 97/00.\n\nB. Fire Suppression Systems\n\nIt does not appear that fire suppression systems are required on buses by Australian national or\nstate regulations. However, it appears that some jurisdictions are requiring them as part of their\ncontractual arrangements with operators. For example, in New South Wales (NSW), a 2018 report\non bus fires states that a project for retrofitting all private operator buses covered by the\nmetropolitan and outer metropolitan bus operators’ contract was completed in September 2017,\n\n5 See Australian Design Rules, Dep’t of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and\nthe Arts (DITRDCA), https:/ / perma.cc/ V7UH-F35K.\n\n6 Motor Vehicle Standards Laws, DITRDCA, https:/ / perma.cc/ NL39-82G8; DITRDCA, M - Category Passenger\nVehicles: Applicability Summary, Australian Design Rules (vers. 2.0, May 2023), https:/ / perma.cc/ A3ZR-X96Y.\n\n?

For children under 7 years of age, the duration of the trip cannot exceed four hours.    \nDepending on the size of the bus and number of passenger seats, school buses are divided into  three categories. Technical characteristics, such as weight, number of doors, location of the gas  tank, clearance, etc., are established for each bus category separately.   \nDuring the period between 2014 and 2021, 19 major accidents with school buses were reported.  A major accident is one where more than 10 children needed medical assistance.   8    While  government statistics shows the number of accidents related to transportation of children is  decreasing every year at the rate of approximately  $10\\%$  , it says that out of about 800,000 children  transportation requests reported to the national police in 2020, safety requirements were not met  in 7,000 cases.  Most of the accidents are attributed to the use of older vehicles and the inability  of the travel industry to supply modern buses for organized school trips.   "}
