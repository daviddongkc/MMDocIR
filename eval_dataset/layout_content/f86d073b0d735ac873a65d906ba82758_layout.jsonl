The provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003, (COTPA), require that the packages of all tobacco products manufactured in the country must bear pictorial health warnings. Since the bulk of tobacco products, apart from cigarettes, are manufactured in the unorganised sector, the provisions of COTPA will, in effect, apply mainly to domestic cigarette manufacture. While smuggled stocks will, in any case, not bear such warnings, most other tobacco products could also escape these stringent legislative requirements. This will give a further fillip to the contraband market in India. While these provisions of COTPA were notified to be effective from 1st June, 2007, in response to representations from stakeholders in the industry, implementation has now been deferred to enable a Committee of Ministers to examine the issues arising from these provisions and make suitable recommendations to the Government. It is hoped that the Committee will take on board the views of all segments of the tobacco industry before framing its recommendations to ensure a fair and equitable legislative climate for all tobacco products.
