For example, the average is 22.37 tokens for English-Czech and 22.51 tokens for English-Turkish.\n\n4. **Avg. tokens (MT)**: This row indicates the average number of tokens in the machine-translated (MT) outputs for each language pair. For instance, the average is 19.45 tokens for English-Czech and 17.25 tokens for English-Turkish. \n\nOverall, the table provides insights into the dataset size and tokenization characteristics across different English into other language translation scenarios."}
