Wild Animal Wet Markets\n\nIn this report, we use the term “wild animal wet market” to refer to physical marketplaces at\nwhich wild animals, their meat, or other derivative products can be purchased for human\nconsumption. In some cases, it was difficult to determine with certainty the existence of such\nmarkets in a country, although there were reports of wild animals or wild meat being traded to\nvarying extents. Some countries, such as Botswana and Angola, where bushmeat is reportedly an\nimportant source of nutrition but where information on how such meat is actually commercially\ntraded is limited, have been included in this report. In addition, examples of countries, such as\nArgentina and Georgia, where game meat may be sold in establishments or markets other than\nwhat might be termed traditional “wet markets” have been included. The following\njurisdictions have also been included in an appendix to this report: Mexico, Saudi Arabia, the\nUnited Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. These jurisdictions do not appear to have wet\nmarkets at which wild animals are sold for human consumption, but have laws relevant to\nanimal protection and/or the safety of game meat.\n\nIII. Legality of Trading in Wild Animals and Their Parts\n\nThe jurisdictions covered in this report restrict the hunting and trading of wild animals through\nwildlife protection and hunting laws. Generally, species that are not listed as protected may be\nhunted, subject to licensing or permit requirements. In a number of the jurisdictions, the trade of\ngame meat or bushmeat for consumption is legal with respect to unprotected animals, with such\ncommercial activity also subject to a permit system. This includes, for example, Botswana,\nCambodia, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Ghana, India, Indonesia, Nepal,\nThailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. In Greenland, meat from wild land animals may be sold by\nhunters directly to consumers, including in local markets. The sale of polar bear meat may only\noccur in such markets after the kill has been officially registered with the municipality and\nbiological tests have been conducted.\n\nSeveral jurisdictions also have laws authorizing and regulating the breeding and raising of wild\nanimals for commercial purposes, including the DRC, Nepal, Thailand, Turkey, and Vietnam. In\nTurkey, the only wild-caught animal that can traded commercially is wild boar.\n\n5 Helen Briggs, Coronavirus: WHO Developing Guidance on Wet Markets, BBC (Apr. 21, 2020),\nhttps:/ / perma.cc/CY8C-LPCA.\n\n6 Id.\n71d.\n8 WHO, A Guide to Healthy Food Markets (2006), https:/ / perma.cc/ Y3CX-RRP4.\n\nThe Law Library of Congress 2\n", "vlm_text": "\nThe WHO previously issued guidance on “healthy food markets” in 2006 as part of a larger  initiative on this issue.   \nII.

Large  distances between wildlife supply areas and potential markets, together with movement  restrictions, have resulted in any legal trade from licensed hunting being localized and  generally limited.   \nFurthermore, from 2014 through 2019, Botswana had instituted a temporary ban on hunting and  stopped issuing hunting licenses with only narrow exceptions.   \nII.  Licensing   \nA.   Substantive Law  \nThe Wildlife Conservation and National Parks Act of 1992 bars trading in “any game animal or  non-designated animal, or the meat, eggs or trophy of any such animal” without a permit.  The  Director of Wildlife and National Parks may, under the direction of the Minister of Environment,  Natural Resources Conservation and Tourism, issue a permit for “the selling of animals killed or  captured under the authority of a licence or permit and the selling of any meat, trophy or eggs  from such animals, where the Director is satisfied that such selling is in the interest of wildlife  conservation and the proper regulation of commercial development connected with wildlife.” 11   The Director may, per the instructions of the Minister, delegate the authority to issue permits to  a licensing officer.

Its provisions regulate the maintenance and  usage of animals, including wild animals.  Wild animal hunting is regulated by the Hunting and  Game Protection Act, adopted on June 6, 2001.  Article 64a of the Act forbids the sale, exchange,  or donation of game and game products without documents related to their origin. The Act  specifically stipulates the rules for the sale of wild animals and wild animal products.    \nUnder this Act sale is allowed only for the purpose of resettlement of animals, farming, zoo and  zoo needs, import, and export.  Amendments to the Act instruct on procedures for obtaining  licenses for sale.   "}

Wildlife falling outside of the\nstate protection catalog may be legally traded if quarantine certificates and other\nmandatory licenses and approvals are obtained.\n\nThe existing Wildlife Protection Law bans food products made from state-protected\nwild animals, but not those made from other wild animals. A land wildlife protection\nregulation prohibits the sale or purchase of state-protected wild animals and products\nat marketplaces, but allows hunting license holders to sell non-state protected wild\nanimals at certain marketplaces designated by local government authorities.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a fast-track legislative decision was passed on\nFebruary 24, 2020, banning consumption of any wild land animals as food, including\nany artificially bred or farmed wild animals. It also bans hunting, trading, or\ntransporting, for the purpose of eating, any land animals that grow and reproduce\nnaturally in the wild. The decision does not ban other uses of wildlife, such as for\nscientific research, medicine, or exhibition. The Wildlife Protection Law is expected to\nbe revised during 2020.\n\nI.

Anyone wishing to use wild animals, or wild animal products, for  commercial purposes must also obtain a government license.  Live wild animals held for  commercial purposes must be quarantined before their commercialization.  Violations of these  provisions are punishable by fines and up to five years in jail.  However, it appears that these  legal provisions are applied very inconsistently, if at all.   \nSome reports indicate that the consumption of meat from wild animals was banned in the DRC  during the 2018 Ebola epidemic.  It appears that this prohibition was temporary, and the legal  status of bushmeat in the DRC is unclear. At least one report states that consumption of bushmeat  in the DRC is currently legal, as it was not banned in the context of the coronavirus pandemic.   Another report states that hunting and consuming bushmeat has, in fact, been banned by the  Congolese government, at least in Virunga National Park.  We were unable to find any primary  sources—laws, decrees or other official texts—confirming whether or not hunting or consuming  bushmeat is currently legal in the DRC.  "}

Legal Status of Markets \nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia conducted market reforms as well as privatization  reforms. All farmers markets and  bazaars  (agricultural markets) became private enterprises.  Farmers markets are privately owned and managers of the markets are obliged to follow  standards and sanitary norms introduced by the government.    \nAs a result of signing the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (DCFTA) with the EU,  safety and security standards have been made stricter in order to enter the EU market.

According to one source, “[a]s long ago as the  fifteenth century, De Marees recorded smoked game and snails being traded over long distances  in Ghana . . .  In 1856, Daniell listed various commodities traded in Accra, including ‘smoked  deer’.” 1  At that time, the trade was regulated under customary and religious rites. One source  describes the practice as follows:  \nBushmeat hunting has a long pedigree dating back to ancient times when hunting was  done on subsistent basis and regulated by socio-cultural practices, i.e. norms, sanctions  and taboos. Most of the various animal species were considered sacred, or totems and their  exploitation restrained by taboos. Other animals were regarded as unclean and abhorred  because of some misfortune in the past associated with those species or religious  restrictions. Some animals were used as sacrificial or ceremonial animals for religious,  cultural and festivals of some communities. Such animals or species were strictly protected  by the various customary rites and practices.   \nThe importance of bushmeat as a source of food and income in Ghana today is undisputed. A  source described the contribution of bushmeat to the lives and livelihoods of large segments of  the Ghanaian society as “one of the most valuable tropical forest products after timber. It is an  important source of protein, widely consumed in both rural and urban areas . . .  It can also make  a significant contribution to households living in extreme poverty (daily per capita income less  than US\\$1), particularly as a source of cash income but also as a key food during the lean  agricultural season.” 3  Another source notes that “[i] n parts of Ghana, bushmeat is the freshest  protein available.

The head of the North Sulawesi Natural  Resources Conservation Center also explained that “law enforcement measures related to quotas  on the use of wild animals had not yet been applied to traders in traditional markets for  cultural reasons.” 13   "}

According to a Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) 2016 report, in  the 1990s, bushmeat is said to have accounted for   $80\\%$   to   $90\\%$   of meat consumption in the  country.  The FAO report notes more recent data indicating that consumption of bush meat is  substantially down, stating that by 2007 “bushmeat represented up to 23 percent of the value of  meat consumption in Liberian rural areas and 7 percent in the capital, Monrovia.” 3  However,  another 2008 report emphasized the importance of bushmeat as a source of employment and diet,  noting that “[i]n many areas, bushmeat hunting is the most lucrative occupation available to  young adult males, and also provides an important component of the diet (three quarters or more  of protein consumption is said to be from wild meat, on a national scale).” 4   "}

Under the Act,  “market” means a place ordinarily arranged for merchants to assemble to offer for sale animals,  meat, vegetables, fruits, prepared or cooked food, or perishable items, with or without other kinds  of goods for sale, regularly, from time to time, or on appointed dates.  In order to establish a  market, a person must obtain a license issued by the local competent official.  The Act states that  the relevant local government issues ordinances and oversees markets.

Rules Regarding the Sale of Wild and Game Animals \nGWAR regulates the transport, sale, import, and export of wild game animals and derived  products. Separate rules apply to game animals taken from the wild and game animals produced  in regulated production facilities. GWAR forbids outright the trade of game meat of any game  animal taken from the wild in accordance with the Ministry’s permission, with the single  exception of wild boar.  Live wild animals that are not produced in regulated production facilities  cannot be stocked or sold for commercial purposes.  Wild boar meat can be sold or exported  upon obtaining special sales and transport licenses from the Ministry.  The hunter who has taken  the boar must obtain a certificate of origin and a transport license from municipal authorities  without butchering the animal.  Licensed purveyors may butcher the animal only after obtaining  a report from a state veterinarian finding that the animal is suitable for human consumption.    \nWild and game animals (including birds, raptors, rodents, and other small mammals, predator  and herbivore mammals, and fur-bearing animals) can be raised by producers upon obtaining  a license from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.  The requirements for obtaining a  license vary according to the species that will be produced and the production capacity.  Producers must document their production by regularly filing production record forms with  the Ministry.  Producers are subject to regular annual and at-will inspections by Ministry  officials, and regular animal health scans must be conducted by licensed veterinarians.   Importation of wild and game animals, their meat, or other products obtained from them are  subject to additional licensing.  GWAR also regulates the labeling of produced animals and the  reporting of livestock to the Ministry.   "}
