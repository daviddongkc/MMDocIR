We aim to retain our  talented employees by offering competitive compensation  and benefits, strong career development and a respectful and  inclusive culture that provides equal opportunity for all.   \nOur Board of Directors, through the Compensation and  Leadership Development Committee (C&LD Committee),  provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategies  relating to talent including diversity, equality and inclusion  as well as the Company’s compensation principles and  practices.  The C&LD Committee also evaluates and  approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and  programs applicable to our senior executives.  \nEmployees \nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately  106,000 employees, an increase of five percent versus the  prior year due primarily to business growth.  The total  number of employees is an estimate of total Company  employees excluding interns, co-ops, contractors and  employees of joint ventures.    $49\\%$   of our employees are in  manufacturing roles and   $26\\%$   of our employees are located  in the United States.    $41\\%$   of our global employees are  women.  As of June 30, 2022,   $28\\%$   of our U.S. employees  identify as multicultural.  \nTraining and Development \nWe focus on attracting, developing and retaining skilled and  diverse talent, both from universities and the broader market.   We recruit from among the best universities across markets  in which we compete and are generally able to select from  the top talent.  We focus on developing our employees by  providing a variety of job experiences, training programs  and skill development opportunities.  Given our develop- from-within model for staffing most of our senior leadership  positions, it is particularly important for us to ensure holistic  growth and full engagement of our employees.    \nDiversity, Equality and Inclusion \nAs a consumer products company, we believe that it is  important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our  consumers worldwide.  We also seek to foster an inclusive  work environment where each individual can bring their  authentic self, which helps drive innovation and enables us  to better serve our consumers.  We aspire to achieve equal  gender representation globally and at key management and  leadership levels.  Within the U.S. workforce, our aspiration  is to achieve   $40\\%$   multicultural representation overall as well  as at management and leadership levels.   \nCompensation and Benefits \nOur compensation plans are based on the principles of  paying for performance, paying competitively versus peer  companies that we compete with for talent and in the  marketplace and focusing on long-term success through a  combination  of  short-term  and  long-term  incentive  programs.  We also offer competitive benefit programs,  including retirement plans and health insurance in line with  local country practices with flexibility to accommodate the  needs of a diverse workforce.  \nSustainability .  Environmental sustainability is a key focus  area and integrated into P&G’s business strategies.  The  Company has declared its focus on developing irresistibly  superior products and packages that are sustainable.  The  Company announced an ambition to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions, purchase renewable electricity for our operations,  reduce our use of virgin petroleum-based plastic in our  packaging, increase the recyclability or reusability of our  packaging and increase responsible sourcing of key forest- based commodities such as wood pulp and palm oil.

Our success depends on  our ability to successfully manage relationships with our  retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer  trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with  our  pricing  and  profitability  targets.    Continued  concentration among our retail customers could create  significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our  business performance could suffer if we cannot reach  agreement with a key customer on trade terms and  principles.  Our business could also be negatively impacted  if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory  level of or shelf space allocated to our products as a result of  increased offerings of other branded manufacturers, private  label brands and generic non-branded products or for other  reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or  experience a significant business disruption.   \n\nIf the reputation of the Company or one or more of our  brands erodes significantly, it could have a material  impact on our financial results.  \nThe Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands,  form the foundation of our relationships with key  stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers,  customers and suppliers.  The quality and safety of our  products are critical to our business.  Many of our brands  have worldwide recognition and our financial success  directly depends on the success of our brands.  The success  of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product  initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image  or its ability to attract consumers.  Our results of operations  or cash flows could also be negatively impacted if the  Company or one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its  reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related  litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product  misuse,  changing  consumer  perceptions  of  certain  ingredients, negative perceptions of packaging (such as  plastic and other petroleum- based materials), lack of  recyclability or other environmental impacts, concerns about  actual or alleged labor or equality and inclusion practices,  privacy lapses or data breaches, allegations of product  tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit  products.  Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or  comments on social media or networking websites about the  Company or one of its brands could generate adverse  publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or  the Company.  If we are unable to effectively manage real or  perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality,  ingredients, efficacy, environmental or social impacts or  similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our  products could be negatively impacted, and our results of  operations or cash flows could suffer.  Our Company also  devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are  consistent with our corporate values and are designed to  strengthen our business and protect and preserve our  reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate  responsibility, strong communities, equality and inclusion  and environmental sustainability.  While the Company has  many programs and initiatives to further these goals, our  ability to achieve these goals is impacted in part by the  actions and efforts of third parties including local and other  governmental authorities, suppliers, vendors and customers.   If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer  negative publicity, the Company's reputation and results of  operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted.  \nWe rely on third parties in many aspects of our business,  which creates additional risk.  \nDue to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on  relationships with third parties, including our suppliers,  contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial  banks, joint venture partners and external business partners,  for certain functions.  If we are unable to effectively manage  our third-party relationships and the agreements under which  our third-party partners operate, our results of operations and  cash flows could be adversely impacted.  Further, failure of  these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company  or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the  Company and these third parties could adversely impact our  operations and financial results.  Additionally, while we have  policies and procedures for managing these relationships,  they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over  business operations, governance and compliance, thereby  potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and  operational risk.

In addition, increasing governmental and societal  attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG)  matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary  reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate  change, waste production, water usage, human capital, labor  and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope and  complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess  and report.  These and other rapidly changing laws,  regulations, policies and related interpretations as well as  increased enforcement actions by various governmental and  regulatory agencies, create challenges for the Company,  including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the  environment in which we do business and may increase the  ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact  our results of operations and cash flows.  If we are unable to  continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws,  regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could  negatively impact our reputation and our business results.   Additionally, we are currently, and in the future may be,  subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, claims,  proceedings and requests for information from governmental  agencies or private parties, the adverse outcomes of which  could harm our business.  Failure to successfully manage  these new or pending regulatory and legal matters and  resolve such matters without significant liability or damage  to our reputation may materially adversely impact our  financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.   Furthermore, if new or pending legal or regulatory matters  result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to  date, that may also materially impact our results of  operations and financial position.  \n\nChanges in applicable tax laws and regulations and  resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our  financial results.  \nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and  numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Changes in the various tax  laws can and do occur.  For example, in December 2017, the  U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation  commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the U.S.  Tax Act).  The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act were  broad and complex.  Under the current U.S. presidential  administration, comprehensive federal income tax reform  has been proposed, including an increase in the U.S. Federal  corporate income tax rate, elimination of certain investment  incentives and a more than doubling of U.S. residual  taxation of non-U.S. earnings.  While these proposals are  controversial, likely to change during the legislative process  and may prove difficult to enact as proposed in the current  closely divided U.S. Congress, their impact could  nonetheless be significant.    \nAdditionally, longstanding international tax norms that  determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border  international trade are subject to potential evolution.  An  outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting  (BEPS) project is a project undertaken by the approximately  140 member countries of the expanded Organisation for  Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Inclusive  Framework focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the  Digitalization of the Economy.\"  The breadth of this project  extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed,  would likely impact a large portion of multinational  businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation  rights in market countries and establishing a global  minimum tax.  Recent pronouncements related to this project  suggest an implementation of the proposed   $15\\%$   global  minimum tax in the near to mid-term.  Continued  negotiations on important details of this project are ongoing,  and ultimate enactment and timing in the EU, US and other  jurisdictions remains uncertain.   "}

We have both translation and\ntransaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates.\nTranslation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of\nmeasuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do\nnot use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.\nTransaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input\ncosts that are denominated in a currency other than the local\nreporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-\nrelated working capital balances denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency. In the past three years, a\nnumber of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S.\ndollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign\nexchange impacts. Certain countries that recently had and\nare currently experiencing significant exchange rate\nfluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia.\nThese fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical\nnet sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the\nfuture. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations\nin foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the\ncurrency impacts but could also have a negative impact on\nthe consumption of our products, which would negatively\naffect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net\nearnings and cash flows.\n\nGovernment Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows\ncould be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government\nlegislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example,\nour net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any\nfuture legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S.\ntax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy\nadopted under the current work being led by the OECD for\nthe G20 focused on \"Addressing the Challenges of the\nDigitalization of the Economy.\" The breadth of the OECD\nproject extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed\nand enacted by most countries, is likely to impact most large\nmultinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional\ntaxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax\non their foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin,\noperating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be\nimpacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government\npolicies related to environmental and climate change\nmatters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our\ndebt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with\ncurrency exchange, import authorization and _ pricing\ncontrols, such as Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina and Egypt.\nFurther, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net\nearnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to\n\ninternational trade agreements in North America and\nelsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas\nmight cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross\nmargin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nCOVID-19 Pandemic. Because we sell products that are\nessential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has\nnot had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net\nsales, net earnings and cash flows.\n\nHowever, the continued evolution of the pandemic may\nresult in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic\ngrowth in certain countries or regions. It could also lead to\nvolatility in consumer access to our products (due to\ngovernmental actions or key material, transportation and\nlabor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship\nproducts) or could impact consumers’ movements and access\nto our products. There could also be reduced demand due to\nconsumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking\n(particularly, in home cleaning, health and hygiene products)\nas economic activity resumes following slowdowns or\nrelaxation of governmental restrictions. Net, the uncertainty\nin the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation\nand reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing\nand impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, the\nfuture economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases\nand governmental actions in response to the pandemic may\nresult in heightened volatility and negative impacts to net\nsales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to\nthe pandemic.\n\nWhile we have been able to broadly maintain our operations,\nwe experienced some disruption in our supply chain in\ncertain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee\nmovements, key material and labor shortages and\ntransportation constraints. We intend to continue to work\nwith our suppliers and government authorities to implement\nemployee safety measures to minimize disruption to the\nmanufacturing and distribution of our products. The\ncontinued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with\nregards to the disruptions caused either by resurgence of\npositive cases or governmental actions in response to the\npandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our\nsupply chain and impact our operations (for example, the\nclosure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the\ninability of a key material or transportation supplier to\nsource and transport materials).\n\nThe pandemic has not had a material negative impact on the\nCompany’s liquidity position. We continue to generate\noperating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs\nand continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled\nby our strong short- and long-term credit ratings.\n\nRussia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine\nhas negatively impacted our operations in both countries.\nOur Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites.

The primary components of SG&A are\nmarketing-related costs and non-manufacturing overhead\ncosts. Marketing-related costs are primarily variable in\nnature, although we may achieve some level of scale benefit\nover time due to overall growth and other marketing\nefficiencies. While overhead costs are variable to some\nextent, we generally experience more scale-related impacts\nfor these costs due to our ability to leverage our organization\nand systems' infrastructures to support business growth. The\nmain drivers of changes in SG&A as a percentage of net\nsales are overhead and marketing cost savings, reinvestments\n(for example, increased advertising), inflation, foreign\nexchange fluctuations and scale impacts.\n\nFor a detailed discussion of the fiscal 2021 year-over-year\nchanges, please refer to the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of the\nCompany's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30\n2021.\n\nNet Sales\n\nNet sales increased 5% to $80.2 billion in fiscal 2022 on a\n2% increase in unit volume versus the prior year.\nUnfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 2%.\nFavorable pricing had a 4% positive impact on net sales.\nMix increased net sales by 1% due to positive geographic\nmix from the disproportionate growth of the North America\nregion and positive category mix from the disproportionate\ngrowth of the Personal Health Care category, both of which\nhave higher than Company-average selling prices.

Here are the details:\n\n1. **Volume**: Data is not available (\"N/A\") for both 2022 and 2021, so there is no percentage change noted.\n\n2. **Net Sales**: \n   - 2022: $14,740 million\n   - 2021: $14,417 million\n   - Change from 2021: An increase of 2%.\n\n3. **Net Earnings**: \n   - 2022: $3,160 million\n   - 2021: $3,210 million\n   - Change from 2021: A decrease of 2%.\n\n4. **Percentage of Net Sales**:\n   - 2022: 21.4%\n   - 2021: 22.3%\n   - Change from 2021: A decrease of 90 basis points (bps).\n\nThe table provides a comparative overview of the company's financial performance between the two years.\nBeauty net sales increased  $2\\%$   to  $\\S14.7$   billion in fiscal 2022  on unit volume that was unchanged.  Higher pricing  increased net sales by  $3\\%$  .  Foreign exchange had no impact  on net sales.  Unfavorable mix decreased net sales by   $1\\%$  due to the disproportionate decline of SK-II, which has  higher than segment-average selling prices.  Organic sales  also increased   $2\\%$  .  Global market share of the Beauty  segment increased 0.1 points.    \n•   Hair Care net sales increased low single digits.  A  negative impact of a low single digit decrease in volume  was more than offset by increased pricing and favorable  mix (due to a higher proportion of premium products,  which have higher than category-average selling prices).   Organic sales also increased low single digits.  Volume  decreased mid-single digits in Greater China (due to  pandemic-related lockdowns and market slowdown in  traditional  retailers  where  our  shares  are  disproportionately higher versus social commerce) and  IMEA (due to competitive activity) and decreased low  single digits in Europe (as a result of portfolio reduction  in Russia and higher pricing in certain markets) and  Asia Pacific (due to competitive activity).  This was  offset by a low single digit volume increase in North  America (due to acquisitions).  Excluding the impacts of  acquisitions, volume was unchanged in North America.   Global market share of the hair care category decreased  less than a point.   \n\n•   Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single  digits.  Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in  volume and increased pricing were partially offset by  negative category mix due to the decline of SK-II brand  (which has higher than category-average selling prices).   Organic sales increased low single digits.  Volume  increased mid-teens in Latin America (due to  innovation) and increased mid-single digits in North  America (due to innovation in personal care and  acquisitions) and in Greater China (due to innovation  and market growth).  Global market share of the skin  and personal care category increased half a point.   \nNet earnings decreased   $2\\%$   to   $\\S3.2$   billion in fiscal 2022 as  the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 90 basis- point decrease in net earnings margin.  Net earnings margin  decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin,  partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of  sales.  The gross margin reduction was driven by increased  commodity and transportation costs and negative product  mix caused by the decline of SK-II (which has higher than  segment-average gross margins), partially offset by  increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales  decreased as the positive scale benefit of the net sales  increase and increased cost savings in marketing spending  were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs.

Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume  (due to increased promotional activity and innovation)  and increased pricing were partially offset by increased  promotional spending (versus the prior year with low  promotional activity due to the pandemic) and  unfavorable mix (due to disproportionate growth in the  club channel, which have lower than category-average  selling prices).

Net earnings margin  decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin,  partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales.   Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in  commodity and transportation costs partially offset by  increased pricing.  SG&A as a percentage of net sales  decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales  increase and reductions in both marketing and overhead  costs.  \nThe table presents financial data for two years, 2022 and 2021, measured in millions of dollars. It includes the following information:\n\n- **Net Sales**: \n  - In 2022, net sales were $744 million.\n  - In 2021, net sales were $441 million.\n  - There was a 69% increase in net sales from 2021 to 2022.\n\n- **Net Earnings/(Loss)**:\n  - In 2022, net earnings were $485 million.\n  - In 2021, there was a net loss of $387 million.\n  - The table does not specify the percentage change for net earnings/(loss) from 2021 to 2022 (denoted as N/A, Not Available).\nCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating  activities not allocated to specific business segments.

Corporate also includes reconciling items to  adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable  segments to U.S. GAAP.  The most notable ongoing  reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended  statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to  the overall Company effective tax rate.  \nCorporate net sales increased   $69\\%$   to   $\\S744$   million in fiscal  2022 due to an increase in the net sales of the incidental  businesses managed at the corporate level.  Corporate net  earnings improved by   $\\S872$   million to   $\\S485$   million in fiscal  2022 due primarily to the prior year loss on the early debt  extinguishment, a current year gain on the divestiture of a  minor business, net sales growth, current year tax benefits  (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based  compensation) and lower restructuring charges, partially  offset by increased commodity costs tied to the  aforementioned incidental businesses.  \nRestructuring Program to Deliver Productivity and Cost  Savings  \nThe Company has historically had an ongoing restructuring  program with annual spending in the range of   $\\S250$   to   $\\S500$  million.    Savings  generated  from  the  Company's  restructuring program are difficult to estimate, given the  nature of the activities, the timing of the execution and the  degree of reinvestment.

Excess  operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividends.   Other discretionary uses include share repurchases and  acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses,  brands and geographies.  As necessary, we may supplement  operating cash flow with debt to fund these activities.  The  overall cash position of the Company reflects our strong  business results and a global cash management strategy that  takes into account liquidity management, economic factors  and tax considerations.  \nThe table shows financial data for the years 2022 and 2021, with values expressed in millions of dollars.

Adjusted free cash flow productivity,\ndefined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings\nwas 93% in 2022.\n\nExtended Payment Terms and Supply Chain Financing.\nBeginning in fiscal 2014, in response to evolving market\npractices, the Company began a program to negotiate\nextended payment terms with its suppliers. At the same\ntime, the Company initiated a Supply Chain Finance\nprogram (the \"SCF\") with a number of global financial\ninstitutions (the \"SCF Banks\"). Under the SCF, qualifying\nsuppliers may elect to sell their receivables from the\nCompany to a SCF Bank. These participating suppliers\nnegotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with\nthe respective SCF Bank. While the Company is not party to\nthose agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating\nsuppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in\nestablishing credit spreads and associated costs. This\ngenerally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms\nthan they would be able to secure on their own. The\nCompany has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision\nto sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to\nparticipate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with an SCF\nBank, they elect which individual Company invoices they\nsell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company’s payments\nto participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company 25\n\ninvoice due date, regardless of whether the individual\ninvoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF\nBank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any\ninvoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank\nunder the SCF.\n\nThe terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not\nimpacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our\npayment terms with our suppliers for similar services and\nmaterials within individual markets are consistent between\nsuppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that\ndo not participate. Accordingly, our average days\noutstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of\nsuppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF.\nIn addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers,\nwhere the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of\ngoods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying\ncosts are largely included in SG&A. As of June 30, 2022,\napproximately 3% of our global suppliers have elected to\nparticipate in the SCF. Payments to those suppliers during\nfiscal year 2022 total approximately $15 billion, which\nequals approximately 25% of our total Cost of goods sold\nand SG&A for the year. For participating suppliers, we\nbelieve substantially all of their receivables with the\nCompany are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we\nwould expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar\nproportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would\ninstead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts\nrelated to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded\nwithin Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance\nSheets, and the associated payments are included in\noperating activities within our Consolidated Statements of\nCash Flows. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount due\nto suppliers participating in the SCF and included in\nAccounts payable were approximately $6 billion and $5\nbillion, respectively.\n\nAlthough difficult to project due to market and other\ndynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from\nthe extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at\na slower rate in fiscal 2023. Future changes in our suppliers’\nfinancing policies or economic developments, such as\nchanges in interest rates, general market liquidity or the\nCompany’s credit-worthiness relative to participating\nsuppliers, could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF\nand/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with\nour suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to\npredict.\n\nInvesting Cash Flow\n\nNet investing activities used $4.4 billion of cash in 2022,\nprimarily due to capital spending and acquisitions. Net\ninvesting activities used $2.8 billion in cash in 2021, mainly\ndue to capital spending.\n\nCapital Spending. Capital expenditures, primarily to\nsupport capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies,\nwere $3.2 billion in 2022 and $2.8 billion in 2021.

The SCF  Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any  invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank  under the SCF.  \n\nThe terms of the Company’s payment obligation are not  impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF.  Our  payment terms with our suppliers for similar services and  materials within individual markets are consistent between  suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that  do not participate.  Accordingly, our average days  outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of  suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF.   In addition, the SCF is available to both material suppliers,  where the underlying costs are largely included in Cost of  goods sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying  costs are largely included in SG&A.  As of June 30, 2022,  approximately   $3\\%$   of our global suppliers have elected to  participate in the SCF.  Payments to those suppliers during  fiscal year 2022 total approximately   $\\S15$   billion, which  equals approximately   $25\\%$   of our total Cost of goods sold  and SG&A for the year.  For participating suppliers, we  believe substantially all of their receivables with the  Company are sold to the SCF Banks.  Accordingly, we  would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar  proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would  instead be payable to SCF Banks.  All outstanding amounts  related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded  within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance  Sheets, and the associated payments are included in  operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of  Cash Flows.  As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the amount due  to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in  Accounts payable were approximately   $\\S6$   billion and   $\\S5$  billion, respectively.  \nAlthough difficult to project due to market and other  dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from  the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at  a slower rate in fiscal 2023.  Future changes in our suppliers’  financing policies or economic developments, such as  changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or the  Company’s credit-worthiness relative to participating  suppliers, could impact suppliers’ participation in the SCF  and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with  our suppliers.  However, any such impacts are difficult to  predict.  \nInvesting Cash Flow  \nNet investing activities used   $\\S4.4$   billion of cash in 2022,  primarily due to capital spending and acquisitions.

Total dividend payments  to common and preferred shareholders were   $\\S8.8$   billion in  2022 and   $\\S8.3$   billion in 2021.  In April 2022, the Board of  Directors declared a   $5\\%$   increase in our quarterly dividend  from   $\\S0.8698$   to   $\\S0.9133$   per share on Common Stock and  Series A and B Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)  Convertible Class A Preferred Stock.  This is the 66th  consecutive year that our dividend has increased.  We have  paid a dividend for 132 consecutive years, every year since  our incorporation in 1890.   \nLong-Term and Short-Term Debt.   We maintain debt levels  we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors,  including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for  ongoing operations, investment and financing plans  (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and  the overall cost of capital.  Total debt was  $\\S31.5$   billion as of  June 30, 2022, and   $\\S32.0$   billion as of June 30, 2021.  We  generated   $\\S1.9$   billion from net debt increases, primarily due  to issuance of bonds.  In 2021, we used   $\\S3.9$   billion for net  debt reductions, including   $\\S512$   million for early debt  extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of   $\\S2.3$  billion of debt.   \nTreasury Purchases.   Total share repurchases were   $\\S10.0$  billion in 2022 and  $\\S11.0$   billion in 2021.    \nImpact of Stock Options and Other.   The exercise of stock  options and other financing activities generated   $\\S2.0$   billion  and  $\\S1.6$   billion of cash in 2022 and 2021, respectively.    \nLiquidity  \nAt June 30, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current  assets by  $\\S11.4$   billion, largely due to short-term borrowings  under our commercial paper program.  We anticipate being  able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs  largely through cash generated from operations.  The  Company regularly assesses its cash needs and the available  sources to fund these needs.  As of June 30, 2022, the  Company had   $\\S5.8$   billion of cash and cash equivalents  related to foreign subsidiaries, primarily in various Western  European and Asian countries.  We did not have material  cash and cash equivalents related to any country subject to  exchange controls that significantly restrict our ability to  access or repatriate the funds.  Under current law, we do not  expect restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held  outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall  liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for  the foreseeable future.    \nWe utilize short- and long-term debt to fund discretionary  items, such as acquisitions and share repurchases.  We have  strong short- and long-term debt ratings, which have  enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our  debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial  paper and bond markets.  In addition, we have agreements  with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed,  should provide sufficient funding to meet short-term  financing requirements.  \nOn June 30, 2022, our short-term credit ratings were P-1  (Moody's) and   $\\mathrm{A}{-}1+$   (Standard & Poor's), while our long- term credit ratings were Aa3 (Moody's) and AA-  (Standard & Poor's), all with a stable outlook.  \nWe maintain bank credit facilities to support our ongoing  commercial paper program.  The current facility is an   $\\S8.0$  billion facility split between a   $\\S3.2$   billion five-year facility  and a   $\\S4.8$   billion 364-day facility, which expire in  November 2026 and November 2022, respectively.  Both  facilities can be extended for certain periods of time as  specified in the terms of the credit agreement.  These  facilities are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they  will remain undrawn.  These credit facilities do not have  cross-default or ratings triggers, nor do they have material  adverse events clauses, except at the time of signing.  In  addition to these credit facilities, we have an automatically  effective registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the  SEC that is available for registered offerings of short- or  long-term debt securities.  For additional details on debt, see  Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  \nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet  financing arrangements, including variable interest entities,  which we believe could have a material impact on our  financial condition or liquidity.

These include pension plans, both defined\ncontribution plans and defined benefit plans, and other\npostretirement benefit (OPRB) plans, consisting primarily of\nhealth care and life insurance for retirees. For accounting\npurposes, the defined benefit pension and OPRB plans\nrequire assumptions to estimate the net projected and\naccumulated benefit obligations, including the following\nvariables: discount rate; expected salary increases; certain\nemployee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age\nand mortality; expected return on assets; and health care cost\ntrend rates. These and other assumptions affect the annual\nexpense and net obligations recognized for the underlying\nplans. Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences\nand management's best judgment regarding future\nexpectations. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the net amount\nby which actual results differ from our assumptions is\ndeferred. If this net deferred amount exceeds 10% of the\ngreater of plan assets or liabilities, a portion of the deferred\namount is included in expense for the following year. The\ncost or benefit of plan changes, such as increasing or\ndecreasing benefits for prior employee service (prior service\ncost), is deferred and included in expense on a straight-line\n\nbasis over the average remaining service period of the\nemployees expected to receive benefits.\n\nThe expected return on plan assets assumption impacts our\ndefined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit\npension plans and our primary OPRB plan are partially\nfunded. The process for setting the expected rates of return\nis described in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. For 2022, the average return on assets\nassumptions for pension plan assets and OPRB assets was\n5.5% and 8.4%, respectively. A change in the rate of return\nof 100 basis points for both pension and OPRB assets would\nimpact annual after-tax benefit/expense by approximately\n$125 million.\n\nSince pension and OPRB liabilities are measured on a\ndiscounted basis, the discount rate impacts our plan\nobligations and expenses. Discount rates used for our U.S.\ndefined benefit pension and OPRB plans are based on a yield\ncurve constructed from a portfolio of high quality bonds for\nwhich the timing and amount of cash outflows approximate\nthe estimated payouts of the plan. For our international\nplans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against\ninvestment grade corporate bonds rated AA or better. The\naverage discount rate on the defined benefit pension plans of\n3.7% represents a weighted average of local rates in\ncountries where such plans exist. A 100 basis point change\nin the discount rate would impact annual after-tax benefit\nexpense by approximately $135 million. The average\ndiscount rate on the OPRB plan of 5.0% reflects the higher\ninterest rates generally applicable in the U.S., which is where\nmost of the plan participants receive benefits.

Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party  valuation specialists for significant goodwill reporting units  and intangible assets.  The fair value estimates are based on  available historical information and on future expectations.   We typically estimate the fair value of these assets using the  income method, which is based on the present value of  estimated future cash flows attributable to the respective  assets.  The valuations used to establish and to test goodwill  and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a  number of significant estimates and assumptions, including  macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates,  competitive activities, cost containment and margin  progression, Company business plans and the discount rate  applied to cash flows.  \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not  amortized, but are tested at least annually for impairment.   Our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and  indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months  ended December 31.  Assumptions used in our impairment  evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of  capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating  plans.  We believe these estimates and assumptions are  reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by  other marketplace participants.  Unanticipated market or  macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which  could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and  assumptions.  For example, future changes in the judgments,  assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment  testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,  including discount and tax rates or future cash flow  projections, could result in significantly different estimates  of the fair values.  In addition, changes to or a failure to  achieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic  conditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher  discount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would  trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets  of these businesses.

For example, future changes in the judgments,\nassumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment\ntesting for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets,\nincluding discount and tax rates or future cash flow\nprojections, could result in significantly different estimates\nof the fair values. In addition, changes to or a failure to\nachieve business plans or deterioration of macroeconomic\nconditions could result in reduced cash flows or higher\ndiscount rates, leading to a lower valuation that would\ntrigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets\nof these businesses.\n\nWe test individual indefinite-lived intangible assets by\ncomparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair\nvalue. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed\nseparately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived\nintangible assets. If the fair value of the reporting unit or\nindefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value, that\ndifference represents an impairment.\n\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also\nrequires judgment. Certain brand intangible assets are\nexpected to have indefinite lives based on their history and\nour plans to continue to support and build the acquired\nbrands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain\nbrands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies)\nare expected to have determinable useful lives. Our\nassessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those\nthat have a determinable life is based on a number of factors\nincluding competitive environment, market share, brand\nhistory, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and\nthe macroeconomic environment of the countries in which\nthe brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are\namortized to expense over their estimated lives.

Certain of our\ngoodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and\nAppliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses\nand as a result have fair value cushions that are not as high\nas our legacy businesses.

The residual\ngrowth rate represents the expected rate at which the\nreporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow\nbeyond the shorter-term business planning period. The\nresidual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is\nconsistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans\nand approximates expected long-term category market\ngrowth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on\noverall market growth rates, the competitive environment,\ninflation, relative currency exchange rates and business\nactivities that impact market share. As a result, the residual\ngrowth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained\ndeceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes,\ndevaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an\nincreased competitive environment. The discount rate,\nwhich is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital\nthat is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based\nupon industry required rates of return, including\nconsideration of both debt and equity components of the\ncapital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by\nadverse changes in the macroeconomic environment,\nvolatility in the equity and debt markets or other country\nspecific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies\nagainst the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value\nmeasurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for\ncash flows outside the U.S. Another key assumption in our\nfair value determination of the Gillette indefinite-lived\nintangible asset is the royalty rate, which is driven by\nhistorical and estimated future profitability of the underlying\nGillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by\nsignificant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWhile management can and has implemented strategies to\naddress these events in the past, changes in operating plans\nor adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic\nenvironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash\nflows used to estimate fair values and could result in a\ndecline in fair value that would trigger future impairment\ncharges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and\nindefinite-lived intangible assets.\n\nThe duration and severity of the pandemic and the Russia-\nUkraine War could result in a slow-down or a recession or\ndrive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations\nin the general economy.

Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed  separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived  intangible assets.  If the fair value of the reporting unit or  indefinite-lived intangible is less than its carrying value, that  difference represents an impairment.  \nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also  requires judgment.  Certain brand intangible assets are  expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and  our plans to continue to support and build the acquired  brands.  Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain  brands, all customer relationships, patents and technologies)  are expected to have determinable useful lives.  Our  assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those  that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors  including competitive environment, market share, brand  history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and  the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which  the brands are sold.  Determinable-lived intangible assets are  amortized to expense over their estimated lives.  An  impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is  only required when an event or change in circumstances  indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be  recoverable.   \nMost of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a  combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a  result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed  three times their underlying carrying values.

The Appliances reporting unit has  a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying  carrying value.    \nBased on our annual impairment testing during the three  months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting  unit's fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than   $30\\%$   and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair  value exceeded its carrying value by approximately   $5\\%$  .     \nThe  most  significant  assumptions  utilized  in  the  determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care  reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible  asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including  residual growth rates) and discount rate.  The residual  growth rate represents the expected rate at which the  reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow  beyond the shorter-term business planning period.  The  residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is  consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans  and approximates expected long-term category market  growth rates.  The residual growth rate is dependent on  overall market growth rates, the competitive environment,  inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business  activities that impact market share.  As a result, the residual  growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained  deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes,  devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an  increased competitive environment.

The royalty rate may be impacted by  significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.   \nWhile management can and has implemented strategies to  address these events in the past, changes in operating plans  or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic  environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash  flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a  decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment  charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and  indefinite-lived intangible assets.   \nThe duration and severity of the pandemic and the Russia- Ukraine War could result in a slow-down or a recession or  drive inflationary pressures or foreign currency devaluations  in the general economy.  These could trigger additional  future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit  goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.   While we have concluded that a triggering event did not  occur during the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Gillette  indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future  impairment risk.

The  continued evolution of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine  War could impact the assumptions utilized in the  determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care  reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible  asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment.   Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively  impacted by more prolonged reductions or changes in  demand for our shave care products, which   may be caused  by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers  to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other  travel restrictions, financial hardship, changes in the use and  frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away  from one or more of our higher priced products to lower  priced products or by disruption in the supply chain or  operations due to the evolving Russia-Ukraine War.  In  addition,  relative  global  and  country/regional  macroeconomic factors including the Russia-Ukraine War  could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other  countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.  Finally, the  discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be  impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk  premiums included in the determination of the cost of  capital.  As of June 30, 2022, the carrying values of the  Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived  intangible asset were   $\\S12.3$   billion and   $\\S14.1$   billion,  respectively.     "}

Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures  that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and  dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit  preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and  expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the  company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or  disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate  because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.   \n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP  Cincinnati, Ohio  August 5, 2022   "}

{"page": 53, "image_path": "doc_images/NYSE_PG_2022_53.jpg", "ocr_text": "42 The Procter & Gamble Company\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNOTE 1\n\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING\nPOLICIES\n\nNature of Operations\n\nwu\n\nThe Procter & Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter\n& Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing\nbranded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and\nvalue. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries\nand territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-\ncommerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery\nstores, membership club stores, drug stores, department\nstores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores\n(including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores,\npharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.\nWe also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground\noperations in approximately 70 countries.\n\nBasis of Presentation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company\nand its controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions\nare eliminated.\n\nBecause of a lack of control over Venezuelan subsidiaries\ncaused by a number of currency and other operating controls\nand restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not\nconsolidated for any year presented. We account for those\nsubsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus\nobservable price changes.\n\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present\nincreases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities\nof more than three months separately within the\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation\nfor the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and June 30,\n2020, have been revised to align with the current period\npresentation. This change had no impact on total financing\nactivities, and we have concluded the change is not material.\n\nUse of Estimates\n\nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States\nof America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported\nin the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying\ndisclosures. These estimates are based on management's\nbest knowledge of current events and actions the Company\nmay undertake in the future. Estimates are used in\naccounting for, among other items, consumer and trade\npromotion accruals, restructuring reserves, pensions,\npostretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired\nintangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and\namortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows\nassociated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite-\nlived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred\ntax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and\ncontingencies. Actual results may ultimately differ from\nestimates, although management does not generally believe\nsuch differences would materially affect the financial\nstatements in any individual year. However, regarding\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\n\nongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived\nintangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow\nprojections or other assumptions used in estimating fair\nvalues versus those anticipated at the time of the initial\nvaluations, could result in impairment charges that\nmaterially affect the financial statements in a given year.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished\nproduct to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a\nsingle performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a\nsingle point in time when ownership, risks and rewards\ntransfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of\nreceipt by the customer.

Non-advertising\nrelated components of the Company's total marketing\nspending reported in SG&A include costs associated with\nconsumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.\n", "vlm_text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  \nNOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING  POLICIES  \nNature of Operations  \nThe Procter & Gamble Company's (the \"Company,\" \"Procter  & Gamble,\" \"we\" or \"us\") business is focused on providing  branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and  value.  Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries  and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e- commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery  stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department  stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores  (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores,  pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels.   We also sell direct to consumers.  We have on-the-ground  operations in approximately 70 countries.  \nBasis of Presentation  \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company  and its controlled subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions  are eliminated.   \nBecause of a lack of control over Venezuelan subsidiaries  caused by a number of currency and other operating controls  and restrictions, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not  consolidated for any year presented.  We account for those  subsidiaries at cost, less impairments, plus or minus  observable price changes.  \nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present  increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities  of more than three months separately within the  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  The presentation  for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, and June 30,  2020, have been revised to align with the current period  presentation.  This change had no impact on total financing  activities, and we have concluded the change is not material.  \nUse of Estimates  \nPreparation of financial statements in conformity with  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported  in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying  disclosures.  These estimates are based on management's  best knowledge of current events and actions the Company  may undertake in the future.  Estimates are used in  accounting for, among other items, consumer and trade  promotion  accruals,  restructuring  reserves,  pensions,  postretirement benefits, stock options, valuation of acquired  intangible assets, useful lives for depreciation and  amortization of long-lived assets, future cash flows  associated with impairment testing for goodwill, indefinite- lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets, deferred  tax assets and liabilities, uncertain income tax positions and  contingencies.  Actual results may ultimately differ from  estimates, although management does not generally believe  such differences would materially affect the financial  statements in any individual year.  However, regarding  ongoing impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived  intangible assets, significant deterioration in future cash flow  projections or other assumptions used in estimating fair  values versus those anticipated at the time of the initial  valuations, could result in impairment charges that  materially affect the financial statements in a given year.  \n\nRevenue Recognition  \nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished  product to customers.  Those sales predominantly contain a  single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a  single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards  transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of  receipt by the customer.  A provision for payment discounts  and product return allowances is recorded as a reduction of  sales in the same period the revenue is recognized.  The  revenue recorded is presented net of sales and other taxes we  collect on behalf of governmental authorities.  The revenue  includes shipping and handling costs, which generally are  included in the list price to the customer.   \nTrade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing  allowances, merchandising funds and consumer coupons, are  offered through various programs to customers and  consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion  spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the  sale.  Most of these arrangements have terms of  approximately one year.  Accruals for expected payouts  under these programs are included as accrued marketing and  promotion in the Accrued and other liabilities line item in the  Consolidated Balance Sheets.  \nCost of Products Sold  \nCost of products sold is primarily comprised of direct  materials and supplies consumed in the manufacturing of  product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation  expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire  and convert the purchased materials and supplies into  finished products.  Cost of products sold also includes the  cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight  costs, internal transfer costs, warehousing costs and other  shipping and handling activity.  \nSelling, General and Administrative Expense  \nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&A) is  primarily comprised of marketing expenses, selling  expenses, research and development costs, administrative  and other indirect overhead costs, depreciation and  amortization expense on non-manufacturing assets and other  miscellaneous operating items.  Research and development  costs are charged to expense as incurred and were   $\\S2.0$  billion in 2022,  $\\S1.9$   billion in 2021 and  $\\S1.8$   billion in 2020.   Advertising costs, charged to expense as incurred, include  worldwide television, print, radio, internet and in-store  advertising expenses and were   $\\S7.9$   billion in 2022,   $\\S8.2$  billion in 2021 and   $\\S7.3$   billion in 2020.  Non-advertising  related components of the Company's total marketing  spending reported in SG&A include costs associated with  consumer promotions, product sampling and sales aids.  "}

We typically use an\nincome method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows\nattributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of\nother marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and\nprofitability). Significant judgement by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on\nfuture cash flows, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War. Estimates utilized in the\nprojected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities,\ncost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic\nbarriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or\nmacroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and\nassumptions.\n\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that\nwould be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used\nin our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to\nestimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related\nintangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\n\nGoodwill decreased during fiscal 2022 due to currency translation across all reportable segments, partially offset by three\nacquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment.\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\n", "vlm_text": "Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing  restructuring-type activities, the restructuring charges are  funded by and included within Corporate for both  management and segment reporting.

We typically use an  income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows  attributable to the respective assets.  Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of  other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and  profitability).  Significant judgement by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on  future cash flows, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War.  Estimates utilized in the  projected cash flows include consideration of macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities,  cost containment and margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic  barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.  Unanticipated market or  macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and  assumptions.     \nWe believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that  would be used by other marketplace participants.  However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used  in our valuations.  To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to  estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related  intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.   \nGoodwill decreased during fiscal 2022 due to currency translation across all reportable segments, partially offset by three  acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment.

Investment risk is  carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and with continual monitoring of  investment managers' performance relative to the investment guidelines established with each investment manager.     \nOur target asset allocation for the year ended June 30, 2022, and actual asset allocation by asset category as of June 30, 2022  and 2021, were as follows:   \nThe table shows target and actual asset allocation percentages for pension and other retiree benefits.

We record derivative instruments  at fair value and the accounting for changes in the fair value  depends on the intended use of the derivative, the resulting  designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in  offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge.  We  generally have a high degree of effectiveness between the  exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument.  \n Credit Risk Management  \nWe have counterparty credit guidelines and normally enter  into transactions with investment grade financial institutions,  to the extent commercially viable.  Counterparty exposures  are monitored daily and downgrades in counterparty credit  ratings are reviewed on a timely basis.  We have not  incurred, and do not expect to incur, material credit losses on  our risk management or other financial instruments.  \nSubstantially all of the Company's financial instruments used  in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard  netting and collateral agreements with counterparties.

Where applicable, these models project future cash\nflows and discount the future amounts to a present value\nusing market-based observable inputs including credit risk,\ninterest rate curves and forward and spot prices for\ncurrencies. In circumstances where market-based observable\ninputs are not available, management judgment is used to\ndevelop assumptions to estimate fair value.\n\nCash equivalents were $6.0 billion and $9.1 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1\nwithin the fair value hierarchy.

Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nLevel 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices\nfor similar investments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using\nnet asset value as a practical expedient.

This includes\nthe current portion of long-term debt instruments ($3.6 billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021). Certain long-term debt (debt\ndesignated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is\nmeasured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

As of and during the years  ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any material  financial commodity hedging activity.  \nInsurance  \ncertain other coverage where it is required by law or by  contract.  \nFair Value Hierarchy  \nAccounting guidance on fair value measurements for certain  financial assets and liabilities requires that financial assets  and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed  in one of the following categories: \n\n \n•   Level 1:  Quoted market prices in active markets for  identical assets or liabilities. \n\n •   Level  2:    Observable  market-based  inputs  or  unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market  data. \n\n •   Level 3:  Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting  entity's own assumptions or external inputs from  inactive markets.  \nWhen applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets  and liabilities, we are required to maximize the use of quoted  market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.   The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used  in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or  liabilities during the year.   \nWhen active market quotes are not available for financial  assets and liabilities, we use industry standard valuation  models.  Where applicable, these models project future cash  flows and discount the future amounts to a present value  using market-based observable inputs including credit risk,  interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for  currencies.  In circumstances where market-based observable  inputs are not available, management judgment is used to  develop assumptions to estimate fair value.    \nWe self-insure for most insurable risks.  However, we  purchase insurance for Directors and Officers Liability and  \nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value  \nCash equivalents were   $\\S6.0$   billion and   $\\S9.1$   billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1  within the fair value hierarchy.  Other investments had a fair value of   $\\S140$   and  $\\S192$   as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively,  including equity securities of   $\\S113$   and   $\\mathbb{S}163$   as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent  assets.  Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.   Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices  for similar investments.  There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using  net asset value as a practical expedient.  Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were   $\\S(45)$   and  $\\S69$   for the fiscal years  ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non- operating income, net.    \nThe fair value of long-term debt was  $\\S25.7$   billion and   $\\S28.8$   billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  This includes  the current portion of long-term debt instruments   $\\textcircled{\\S3.6}$   billion as of June 30, 2022 and 2021).  Certain long-term debt (debt  designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value.  All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is  measured at fair value for disclosure purposes.  We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  Fair values are  generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments.  "}

We lease certain real estate, machinery,  equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying  periods.  Many of these leases include an option to either  renew or terminate the lease.  For purposes of calculating  lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease  term when it has become reasonably certain that the  Company will exercise such options.  The incremental  borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is  based on the information available at commencement date,  as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing  rate.  Our operating lease agreements do not contain any  material guarantees or restrictive covenants.  The Company  does not have any material finance leases or sublease  activities.
