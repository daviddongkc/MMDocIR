{"layout": 6, "type": "text", "text": "Path o genetics; Mutagens; Mutation; Path o genetic mechanisms; Anti-mutation mechanisms Abstract Path o genetics refers to studying the different aspects of initiation/development/progres sion and pathogen es is of genetic defects. It comprises the study of mutagens or factors capable of affecting the structural integrity of the genetic material leading to mutational changes that, in the majority of cases, result in harmful effects due to the resulting disturbances of functions of mutated components of the genome. The study of mutagens depicts different types of mutagenic factors, their nature, their class i cation according to their effects on the genetic material and their different modes of action. The study of mutation involves different types of mutations classiﬁed according to various parameters, e.g. magnitude, severity, target of mutational event as well as its nature, which can be classiﬁed, in turn, according to whether it is spontaneous or induced, static or dynamic, somatic or germinal mutation etc. Finally, path o genetics comprises studying and delin- eating the different and innumerable path o physiological alterations and path o genetic mechanisms that are directly and indirectly involved in, and leading to, the development of genetic disorders, coupled with a parallel study of various anti-mutation mechanisms that play critical roles in minimizing the drastic effects of mutational events on the genetic material and in effective protection against the development of these diseases.

Spontaneous mutations, on the other hand, are mutations that occur without recognizable causes. Spontaneous mutations happen, probably, on a regular basis because of the intrinsic nature of the genome. Possible poten- tial causes of spontaneous mutation of the genome can be delineated and include: transposon activity, taut omer is m and changes of energy states of hydrogen bonds of bases. Transposon activity represents a major potential cause of spontaneous mutations  [2] . The movement of transposons results in insertion al mutagen es is and disruption of targeted genes or other functional genetic elements. Disturbed gene function with resultant deﬁciency of gene product, production of defective protein/RNA or loss of genetic regulatory mecha- nisms exerted by mutated genes follows transposon-induced mutations. Taut omer is m of bases of the DNA also accounts for a considerable fraction of spontaneous mutations of the genetic material. Changes of energy states of hydrogen bonds between complementary bases of DNA represent a third potential cause of spontaneous mutation. Alterations resulting from changes in electron resonance and/or proton transfer or relocation between the bonds can lead to tautomeric shift or taut omer iz ation and momentary change of one base to another base, thus inducing point mutation, transition muta- tion  [1] . The actual mechanisms underlying the occurrence of these changes are still largely undeﬁned, precisely. Analysis of DNA base dynamics according to quantum, rather than to Newtonian, principles seems essential for clarifying these mechanisms, and the concept of quantum biology, or studying the structure and function of the genetic material based on principles and rules of quantum mechanics, would certainly prevail due to the progressive increase in our knowledge of the structure and function(s) of our genome and our proteome.

Mutations of nuclear genes account for the occurrence of most genetic diseases. Due to the marked differences between the speciﬁc structural organi- zation of each genome, each type of these mutations has its own characteristic features. Nuclear mutations may affect one or both alleles of a structural gene on an autosome or on a sex chromosome, thus giving rise to any of the traditional genetic disorders: autosomal and sex linked dominant and recessive diseases. The presence of most nuclear genes as pairs of alleles derived equally from both parents, paternal and maternal alleles, allows for this class i cation of genetic dis- eases due to nuclear gene mutations to be formulated clearly. Mitochondrial mutations, on the other hand, have different features due to the peculiar nature of the mtDNA. Each mtDNA molecule consists of 37 genes and exists inside the mitochondrion in large numbers, tens to thousands, depending on the metabolic activities of the cell and its demand for ATP. Thus, the copy number of each mtDNA molecule, and of mitochondrial genes is extremely huge in metabolically active organs, e.g. brain, retina, heart, liver, kidney and skeletal muscles. Mutations of mitochondrial genome can affect a considerable portion of its genes without affecting its efﬁciency in mediating its functions.
