The statute lists actions by foreign\ncountries on the following issues as relevant to evaluating performance under the 1988 UN Drug\nConvention: illicit cultivation, production, distribution, sale, transport and financing, and money\nlaundering, asset seizure, extradition, mutual legal assistance, law enforcement and transit\ncooperation, precursor chemical control, and demand reduction.\n\nIn attempting to evaluate whether countries and certain entities are meeting the goals and\nobjectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Department has used the best information it has\navailable.

Specifically, El Aissami\nreceived payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin\nWalid Makled Garcia. El Aissami also is linked to coordinating drug shipments to Los Zetas, a\nviolent Mexican drug cartel, as well as providing protection to Colombian drug lord Daniel\nBarrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco.\n\nIn November 2016, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and\nFrancisco Flores de Freitas, were convicted by a federal court in New York of conspiracy to\ntraffic 800 kg of cocaine to the United States.

A national interest waiver for Fiscal Year 2019 for Venezuela permits  support for United States government-funded bilateral assistance programs vital to the national  interest of the United States, such as democracy building and human rights advocacy.   \nVenezuela remained a major drug-transit country in 2018.  Venezuela is one of the preferred  trafficking routes for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine, from South America to the Caribbean  region, Central America, the United States, Western Africa, and Europe, due to its porous  western border with Colombia, weak judicial system, sporadic international counter narcotics  cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment.    \nPublic corruption, including among senior government officials, is a major problem in  Venezuela, making it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to smuggle illegal drugs.  The  Venezuelan government, as a matter of policy, does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug  production or distribution, nor does it condone laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs;  however, the Maduro regime knowingly maintains a United States designated Narcotics Kingpin  in its Cabinet.   \nOn February 13, 2017, the United States designated Venezuelan Executive Vice President  Tareck El Aissami pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for his  involvement in international narcotics trafficking activities.  El Aissami facilitated, coordinated,  and protected other narcotics traffickers operating in Venezuela.  Specifically, El Aissami  received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin  Walid Makled Garcia.  El Aissami also is linked to coordinating drug shipments to Los Zetas, a  violent Mexican drug cartel, as well as providing protection to Colombian drug lord Daniel  Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco.  \nIn November 2016, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and  Francisco Flores de Freitas, were convicted by a federal court in New York of conspiracy to  traffic  $800\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of cocaine to the United States.  In 2017, the nephews were unsuccessful in  overturning their convictions on appeal.  In August 2016, the United States unsealed indictments  against General Nester Luis Reverol Torres, the former director of ONA and former commander  of the National Guard, and Edylberto Jose Molina Molina, former sub-director of ONA, for  participating in an international cocaine trafficking conspiracy.

The first course of four of the new curriculum  Women’s Interventions for Substance Exposure (WISE) completed its pilot testing in December  2018 and will complete the remaining three courses in the spring of 2019 before it is peer  reviewed and finalized.   \nAlternatives to Incarceration:   The United Nations Special Session on Drugs Outcome  Document and the U.S.-sponsored CND resolution in 2016 called on countries to support  alternatives to incarceration and proportionate sentencing, especially for drug dependent,  nonviolent offenders.  Alternatives to incarceration – including an emphasis on gaining access to  drug treatment and care – can occur before an arrest, at an initial court hearing, within the jail, at  re-entry and through community corrections such as probation.  In 2018, INL supported the  development of training for policymakers and agency heads from both the public health sector  and criminal justice sector to discuss critical areas of need within a particular country related to  alternatives to incarceration.  The course was pilot tested in Jamaica in October and will also be  pilot tested in Guyana in 2019 before undergoing a peer review process and finalization.  "}

The COC Order added a total of 29 chemicals, including ANPP  and NPP, two precursor chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl and its analogues, and all  chemicals in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to Schedule 2 of the COC.    \nThe DDO Order added additional synthetic drugs to the First Schedule of the DDO, including  EPH, MPA, MDMB-CHMICA, SF-APINACA, and the synthetic opioid U-47700.  The COC,  which establishes a licensing regime over importers, exporters, dealers, traders, manufacturers,  and handlers of the designated chemicals, applies equally to imports, exports, and  transshipments.  Permits for every shipment are mandatory.  Government approval for all  premises and containers used to store such chemicals is also mandatory.  The maximum penalty  for illicit chemical trafficking is imprisonment for 15 years and a fine of  $\\mathbb{S}130{,}000$  .  The  Controlled Chemicals Group (CCG) of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s Drug  Investigations Bureau administers and enforces the Ordinance.   \nPermit applications to handle controlled chemicals, including those for the partial removal of  chemicals while in transit, must be received by CCG at least 10 days prior to the proposed date  of activity.  CCG uses this interim period to establish the bona fides of a proposed shipment,  including through coordination with foreign counterparts via the Pre-Export Notification System.   Export permits are only issued upon receipt of “No Objection” letters from competent authorities  in importing jurisdictions.  While Hong Kong does not control sales of over-the-counter  medicines containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, CCG does investigate reports of possible  diversion or parallel trading involving those substances.  \nHong Kong supports international efforts to prevent illicit chemical diversion, though tends to be  less engaged when chemicals transiting Hong Kong are not controlled in the territory.  \nIndia   \nIndia’s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) provides the country’s  legislative framework to implement precursor chemical control obligations required by the 1988  UN Drug Convention.

These guidelines, now titled “Guidelines for Operators – Drug  Precursors' Control in the EU,” have been updated in 2017.     \nGermany    \nGermany continues to be a leading manufacturer of legal pharmaceuticals and chemicals that can  be used to produce illicit drugs.  According to the most recent available data from 2017,  Germany was one of the largest global exporters of ephedrine   $(20.6\\,\\mathrm{MT})$   and pseudoephedrine  (259.1 MT), as reported by the Global Trade Atlas (GTA) database, which relies on statistics  from the European Commission Statistics Office (Eurostat).  Most of the 28 scheduled precursors  under international control and listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Drug Convention are  manufactured and/or sold by the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry.   \nGermany’s National Precursor Monitoring Act complies with EU regulations. Germany has a  highly developed chemical sector, which is tightly controlled through a combination of national  and EU regulations, law enforcement action, and voluntary industry compliance.  Cooperation  between the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, merchants, and German authorities is a key  element in Germany’s chemical control strategy.    \nGermany works closely with the UNODC, and is an active participant in chemical control  initiatives led by the INCB, including Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  The United States  works closely with Germany’s chemical regulatory agency, the Federal Institute for Drugs and  Medical Devices, on chemical control issues and exchanges bilateral information to promote  transnational chemical control initiatives.  German agencies cooperate closely with their U.S.  counterparts to identify and stop chemical precursor diversion.    "}

The phenomenon of substitute chemicals used in methamphetamine production\nis particularly observed in Mexico, where the nitrostyrene method is used to produce P-2-P,\nwhich starts from benzaldehyde and nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2-\nnitropropene, and in Europe, where the method using APAAN, are largely used.\nPhenylpropanolamine, a third chemical listed in the CMEA, is not a methamphetamine\nprecursor, although it can be used as an amphetamine precursor.\n\nIn 2000, the FDA issued warnings concerning significant health risks associated with\nphenylpropanolamine. As a result, phenylpropanolamine is no longer approved for human\nconsumption. Phenylpropanolamine is still imported for veterinary medicines, and for the\nconversion to amphetamine for the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceutical products.\nPhenylpropanolamine is not a methamphetamine precursor chemical, and trade and production\ndata are not available on phenylpropanolamine. Therefore, this section provides information\nonly on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.\n\n82\n", "vlm_text": "The PNP’s Precursor Chemical Unit, DEPCIQ, reported an increase in PNP seizures of precursor  chemicals over the first nine month of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017 – from  7,826 MT in 2017 to 8,199 MT.  Peru continued to implement the 2015 Precursor Chemicals  Initiative to cover approximately 70 percent of roads in the VRAEM, the Peru-Bolivia border, as  well as the Junín, Ayacucho, and Lima regions, utilizing 12 backscatter x-ray scanners in  strategic corridor routes.  \nAlleged corruption within SUNAT and the PNP fosters mistrust between the entities, leading to  an unwillingness by either to share investigative information related to precursor chemicals.    \nThe Ministry of Health manages estimates of Peru’s INCB licit demand for ephedrine,  pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  The Ministry’s Health Department does not have a regulatory or  enforcement arm to prevent the diversion of chemicals.  According to INCB records, Peru does  not have strict controls to prevent the diversion of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.   Indications suggest that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are entering the country in larger  quantities than required by the INCB assessment.    \nMajor Exporters and Importers of Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine (Section 722, Combat  Methamphetamine Epidemic Act “CMEA”)    \nThis section of the INCSR is produced in response to the CMEA’s Section 722 requirement to  report on the five major importing and exporting countries of the identified methamphetamine  precursor chemicals.  In meeting the CMEA requirements, the Department of State and DEA  considered the chemicals involved and the available data on their export, import, worldwide  production, and the known legitimate demand.  The available data does not address illicit  trafficking and production.    \nEphedrine and pseudoephedrine are no longer the preferred chemicals for methamphetamine  production shipped to the United States, since traffickers are increasingly using substitutes or  pre-precursors.  The phenomenon of substitute chemicals used in methamphetamine production  is particularly observed in Mexico, where the nitrostyrene method is used to produce P-2-P,  which starts from benzaldehyde and nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2- nitropropene, and in Europe, where the method using APAAN, are largely used.   Phenyl prop a nola mine, a third chemical listed in the CMEA, is not a methamphetamine  precursor, although it can be used as an amphetamine precursor.    \nIn 2000, the FDA issued warnings concerning significant health risks associated with  phenyl prop a nola mine.  As a result, phenyl prop a nola mine is no longer approved for human  consumption.  Phenyl prop a nola mine is still imported for veterinary medicines, and for the  conversion to amphetamine for the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceutical products.   Phenyl prop a nola mine is not a methamphetamine precursor chemical, and trade and production  data are not available on phenyl prop a nola mine.  Therefore, this section provides information  only on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.    "}

Despite public displays of support for this  comprehensive national drug control strategy, the Afghan government has been slow to  implement it.  The Afghan government will require financial and technical assistance from the  international community for the foreseeable future to achieve the NDAP’s objectives.  \nB.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  \n1.   Institutional Development  \nThe Afghan government is publicly committed to confronting the drug problem in Afghanistan,  focusing particularly on what it identifies as the underlying root causes of the drug economy,  including instability, poverty, organized crime, and lack of economic opportunity.  MCN is the  lead agency for developing drug control policy and coordinating related government activities.   As part of President Ashraf Ghani’s reform agenda, the Afghan National Unity Government  (GNU) has pledged “to intensify efforts to control narcotic production and sale.”  MCN is also  working to “mainstream” drug control into the activities of the entire government.  Enlisting the  support of other ministries to counter illicit drugs requires top-level Afghan government support,  which has been historically lacking.   "}

Algeria works within the Euro-Mediterranean  cooperation network MedNET, created in 2006 to advance regional cooperation in the fight  against drugs.  \nThe National Office for the Fight Against Drugs and Addiction coordinates the Government of  Algeria’s drug policies and produces official reports on the country’s drug problem.  The  National Police, Customs, and National Gendarmerie are responsible for day-to-day  enforcement.  During the first eight months of 2018, authorities seized 27.7 metric tons of  cannabis and 958,476 doses of psychotropic substances, and arrested 33,595 individuals on drug- related charges.  In May 2018, authorities seized a shipment of 701 kilograms of cocaine in the  port of Oran.  Algeria would benefit from further training to boost counterdrug capabilities of its  security forces.

National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  \nThe United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance  public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security  Initiative (CBSI).  In 2018, a CBSI-funded maritime surveillance system radar was installed in  the southern-most island of Great Inagua to provide greater visibility of maritime and air traffic  through the windward pass.  CBSI funds have also been used over the past two years to provide  maintenance and logistic support for the RBDF maritime interceptor vessels.  In addition,  security cooperation activities with the RBDF enhance capabilities in maritime law enforcement,  intelligence, small boat operations, port security, engineering, disaster relief, and maintenance.    \nThe United States and The Bahamas maintain close maritime law enforcement cooperation and  coordination under a comprehensive maritime agreement to combat illicit trafficking of illicit  drugs by sea and air.  The Bahamas is a regular participant in the annual Multilateral Maritime  Interdiction and Prosecution Summit and hosted the sixth iteration of the summit in Nassau on  August 7-8, 2018, bringing together over 100 maritime counterdrug professionals from over 15  countries from across the Caribbean and Europe.  \nThe United States has delivered training, technical assistance, and equipment needed by  Bahamian government counterparts to combat transnational organized criminal networks and  improve citizen security in The Bahamas.  In October 2018, the United States completed the  installation of digital recording equipment in the Magistrates and Supreme Court courtrooms in  New Providence, Grand Bahama, and Abaco Islands.  The courts use this equipment to record  court proceedings in support of Bahamian plans to increase justice sector efficiency.   Additionally, the Embassy donated ballistics vests and protective gear, a new Leica macroscope,  and updated licenses and training on IBM computer programs to the RBPF.  Finally, the  Embassy provided training for the Internal Affairs Division within the Bahamas Department of  Corrections.   \nThe United States sent officials from the police and justice sector to external training focused on  organized crime, investigating gangs, and trafficking in persons.  The United States organized a  training for magistrates and registrars to prepare them for the administration al changes involved  with the new digital audio recording equipment.  Additionally, the United States provided a  senior justice advisor to meet with key staff in the Ministries of National Security, Legal Affairs,  and Finance to provide technical assistance as these ministries establish practices to address  issues with corruption.  The advisor provided guidance on draft legislation, as well as established  a program for increasing contact between these ministries and several U.S. counterparts.

It has two U.S.-supported specialized\nunits — the Anti-Narcotics Unit comprised of 15 police officers and Mobile Interdiction Team\ncomprised of 38 members.

The LOAs, dated August 2010, include elements of establishing  the police vetted unit and its area of responsibility, security sector reform, drug control,  transnational crime, demand reduction, and community policing.    \nThe United States also maintains a bilateral agreement with Belize to suppress illicit traffic by  sea and air, which includes provisions for ship boarding, ship riders, pursuit, entry to investigate,  over flight of territorial seas, order to land, and for the use of third-party platforms.  Belize is a  regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring  together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international  organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  \nD.  Conclusion   \nBelize faces a challenging drug control environment and strong leadership is necessary to reduce  the impact of drug trafficking and crime in the country.  The United States will continue to assist  Belize’s law enforcement and justice sectors by providing training, advisory, and institutional  support to combat drug trafficking.  The United States encourages Belize to strengthen its public  security and law enforcement institutions through more effective anti-corruption legislation,  modern drug control legislation, comprehensive background checks and vetting of new and  existing personnel, enhanced training, and continuing education programs.

In  conjunction with the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, the Vice Minister of Social  Defense visited the State Department and requested continued cooperation and exchange of  information of eradication imagery and data.  \nD.  Conclusion   \nBolivia remains the third largest source of coca and cocaine in the world, and a major transit  country for Peruvian cocaine.  For the second time since 2010, UNODC estimates coca  cultivation is increasing and, even with a decrease in U.S. coca cultivation estimates, both  UNODC and U.S. 2017 estimates are well above the government-sanctioned limit of 22,000 ha.   Despite a decrease in U.S. estimates in 2017, potential pure cocaine production in Bolivia  remains historically high at  $249\\;\\mathrm{MT}$   when compared to 170 MT less than a decade ago.  There is  no available data to support the Bolivian government’s statements that traditional, cultural, and  medicinal coca consumption have increased, which it made in justifying the increase in the legal  limit of coca cultivation in the new General Law on Coca from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha.

Introduction  \nColombia is the world’s top producer and exporter of cocaine, as well as a source country of  heroin and marijuana.  Colombian coca cultivation and cocaine production exceeded all-time  record levels during 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available).

Reducing the availability of illicit drugs requires a\nstable post-peace accord environment, the extension of citizen security and the rule of law\nthroughout Colombia, economic development in rural areas, and the countering of illegal armed\ngroups that have plagued Colombia for decades. Colombian authorities, and third countries\nusing Colombian intelligence, reported seizing over 450 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base in\n2018, as well as approximately 250 MT of marijuana, over 320 kilograms of heroin, and\ndestroyed 3,855 cocaine base laboratories and 319 cocaine hydrochloride (HCI) laboratories.\n\n3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment\n\nAccording to the most recent National Household Survey of Drug Consumption, from 2014,\ndrug use in Colombia rose between 2008 and 2013, making Colombia the country with the fourth\nhighest consumption of cocaine and marijuana in South America.

Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  \nLocal drug use is concentrated in tourist centers and major metropolitan areas, although drug use  and associated violence occurs throughout the country.  The CND conducted demand reduction  efforts in 2018 to warn Dominican youth of the negative effects of illicit drug use under the  Strategic National University Plan on the Prevention and Use of Drugs.  The DNP promoted  community-based policing as an effective way to deal with crime locally.  With the publication  of its Community Policing manual, the DNP began outreach at the command level to implement  community policing concepts more fully in the capital and other major population centers around  the country.  \n4.   Corruption  \nAs a matter of policy, the Dominican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug  production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.   However, corruption remains endemic.  The Government of the Dominican Republic has taken  some steps to address corruption among military and law enforcement forces, but corruption  remains a significant impediment to law enforcement efforts in the country and prosecution of  "}

It is unclear whether his successor, Raul Melara, will demonstrate the same  commitment to combating corruption.   \nIn July, El Salvador’s legislative assembly passed new legislation giving greater autonomy to the  country’s Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), in an effort to comply with a request from the  Egmont Group, a network of international FIUs.  However, a Presidential veto in August over  constitutional concerns resulted in the suspension of El Salvador’s FIU from the Egmont Group,  for its inability to maintain operational independence and autonomy.

The HNP still faces challenges regulating its internal\naffairs, particularly in more remote areas in Haiti. The OIG recommended officers for discipline\nfor various offenses in 2018, but most of its recommendations have thus far gone unmet. The\nHNP held monthly press conferences to inform the public of their roles and responsibilities, and\nto report cases of misconduct. The OIG maintains a 24-hour hotline to receive public reports of\npolice corruption or misconduct. As of August 2018, the OIG had recommended 23 officers for\ndismissal, compared with 11 such recommendations in 2017.\n\nThe HCG is the sole maritime enforcement agency in the country. An additional 42 officers\nfrom the 29\" HNP promotion class joined the HCG, bringing the overall size of the unit to 204\nofficers. The HCG has operating bases in Cap Haitien, Killick (Port-au-Prince), and Les\n\nCayes. The force has 15 maritime vessels, but only five are currently operational, with seven of\nthe remaining 10 vessels non-repairable due to age. Maritime domain awareness and\nenforcement are daunting tasks for the HCG, considering Haiti’s 1,100 miles of coastline and\nseven international ports. Operational capacity remains low due to insufficient funding,\nmanagement deficiencies, an inability to refuel, and unavailability of locally procured parts to\nmaintain the vessels. These issues have prevented the HCG from serving as an effective\ndeterrent force to maritime drug trafficking.\n\nHaiti maintains several international agreements on drug control commitments and often\ncooperates effectively with the United States on drug-related cases. A 1997 bilateral letter of\nagreement on Cooperation to Suppress Illicit Maritime Drug Traffic allows U.S. law\nenforcement agencies to enter Haitian territorial waters and airspace in pursuit of suspect vessels\nor aircraft, to board and search suspect vessels, to patrol Haitian airspace, and to carry members\nof the HCG as passengers. Although there is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Haiti and\nthe United States, the Haitian government has cooperated on many cases within the limits of\nHaitian law.

The HNP still faces challenges regulating its internal  affairs, particularly in more remote areas in Haiti.  The OIG recommended officers for discipline  for various offenses in 2018, but most of its recommendations have thus far gone unmet.  The  HNP held monthly press conferences to inform the public of their roles and responsibilities, and  to report cases of misconduct.  The OIG maintains a 24-hour hotline to receive public reports of  police corruption or misconduct.  As of August 2018, the OIG had recommended 23 officers for  dismissal, compared with 11 such recommendations in 2017.  \nThe HCG is the sole maritime enforcement agency in the country.  An additional 42 officers  from the  $29^{\\mathrm{th}}$   HNP promotion class joined the HCG, bringing the overall size of the unit to 204  officers.  The HCG has operating bases in Cap Haitien, Killick (Port-au-Prince), and Les  Cayes.  The force has 15 maritime vessels, but only five are currently operational, with seven of  the remaining 10 vessels non-repairable due to age.  Maritime domain awareness and  enforcement are daunting tasks for the HCG, considering Haiti’s 1,100 miles of coastline and  seven international ports.  Operational capacity remains low due to insufficient funding,  management deficiencies, an inability to refuel, and unavailability of locally procured parts to  maintain the vessels.  These issues have prevented the HCG from serving as an effective  deterrent force to maritime drug trafficking.    \nHaiti maintains several international agreements on drug control commitments and often  cooperates effectively with the United States on drug-related cases.  A 1997 bilateral letter of  agreement on Cooperation to Suppress Illicit Maritime Drug Traffic allows U.S. law  enforcement agencies to enter Haitian territorial waters and airspace in pursuit of suspect vessels  or aircraft, to board and search suspect vessels, to patrol Haitian airspace, and to carry members  of the HCG as passengers.  Although there is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Haiti and  the United States, the Haitian government has cooperated on many cases within the limits of  Haitian law.

Supply Reduction  \nAccording to the JCF, authorities seized 63 kilograms   $\\left(\\mathrm{kg}\\right)$   of cocaine over the first nine months  of 2018.  Jamaican authorities seized   $658~\\mathrm{kg}$   during the same period in 2017.  In 2018, the JCF’s  forces have been stretched thin by various state of emergency operations.  \nSignificant cocaine seizures at or near the Port of Kingston have indicated that large shipments  reached Jamaica via commercial shipping containers from South America.  Cocaine also arrives  in Jamaica via small “go-fast” watercraft from Central and South America, likely with the  assistance of larger fishing vessels that serve as mother ships.  After reaching Jamaica, some  cocaine shipments are transshipped in containers through the Port of Kingston onto vessels  bound for the United States and other international markets.  Other shipments enter the country  and are divided into smaller quantities for outbound shipment via other means, including  concealment in luggage, human couriers, air freight, or small watercraft.  \nIn 2015, legislation to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of marijuana for  personal use went into effect.  During the first nine months of 2018, Jamaican authorities  eradicated 186 hectares (ha) of cannabis plants and seized approximately 20.2 metric tons of  cured marijuana, according to police data.  Jamaican farmers cultivate an estimated 15,000 ha of  cannabis every year.  The police, supported by the United States, employ an eradication team to  cut growing plants, seize seedlings and cured marijuana, and burn them in the field.  The team  conducts only manual eradication, since Jamaican law prohibits the use of herbicides.    \nTraffickers smuggle Jamaican-grown marijuana out of the country via commercial shipping and  small watercraft.  Small fishing vessels and speed boats carry marijuana to Haiti, the Cayman  Islands, and the Bahamas.  A thriving “guns for ganja (marijuana)” trade continues between  "}

Transnational criminal\norganizations that transship drugs through Kenya also engage in a wide range of additional\ncriminal activity, including corruption, money laundering and wildlife trafficking. Drug\ntrafficking organizations utilize Kenya as a transshipment point for heroin and to a lesser extent,\ncocaine and methamphetamine. The most commonly used illicit drug by Kenyan adults is\ncannabis, followed by heroin and diverted pharmaceutical drugs.\n\nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act of 1994 and its various\namendments provide the basis for drug law enforcement within Kenya. Criminal asset forfeiture\nlaws are also in place allowing for the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds from drug trafficking, as\nwell as assets used in furtherance of such crimes. The Anti-Narcotic Units of the Kenya Police\nService enforce narcotics laws throughout the country, while other law enforcement agencies\nfrequently assist in drug enforcement matters.\n\nThe importation of heroin into Kenya is a major focus of law enforcement authorities. This\ncriminal activity brings with it a multitude of other threats, including corruption and increased\nlocal use of the drug. Although heroin is used throughout Kenya, consumption is most prevalent\nalong the coastal area surrounding Mombasa. Heroin enters Kenya both through maritime\nsmuggling and over land borders, primarily in the south of Kenya. Cocaine frequently transits\nKenya, primarily by couriers traveling commercial airlines.

Drug  trafficking organizations utilize Kenya as a transshipment point for heroin and to a lesser extent,  cocaine and methamphetamine.  The most commonly used illicit drug by Kenyan adults is  cannabis, followed by heroin and diverted pharmaceutical drugs.  \nThe Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act of 1994 and its various  amendments provide the basis for drug law enforcement within Kenya.  Criminal asset forfeiture  laws are also in place allowing for the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds from drug trafficking, as  well as assets used in furtherance of such crimes.  The Anti-Narcotic Units of the Kenya Police  Service enforce narcotics laws throughout the country, while other law enforcement agencies  frequently assist in drug enforcement matters.    \nThe importation of heroin into Kenya is a major focus of law enforcement authorities.  This  criminal activity brings with it a multitude of other threats, including corruption and increased  local use of the drug.  Although heroin is used throughout Kenya, consumption is most prevalent  along the coastal area surrounding Mombasa.

Supply Reduction    \nLocal marijuana production is not seen as a major concern by the public, and while there is little  information on the extent of local cannabis cultivation, or the local sales networks, marijuana is  clearly the most widely available drug in the country.  \nIn 2018, the LDEA seized a total of approximately 4.5 metric tons (MT) of marijuana, 4.8  kilograms   $(\\mathrm{kg})$   of cocaine,   $12.5\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of heroin, and   $6\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of methamphetamine (a new class of  illicit drugs just seen in Liberia over the past two years).  Also in 2018, the LDEA made  significant progress in its fight to counter international drug trafficking through air couriers, and  successfully interdicted six   foreign nationals and seized   $267\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of khat (a traditional stimulant  used in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula), four  $\\mathrm{kg}$   of heroin, and two  $\\mathrm{kg}$   of cocaine at  Roberts International Airport.    \n3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment    \nDue to a lack of resources and capacity, the government has conducted very little drug  prevention, rehabilitation or treatment since the 1970’s (pre-civil war), with persons with  substance use disorders being referred to the only psychiatric hospital in Liberia or to one of the  few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field.  A bright spot was on June  26, when the LDEA hosted International Day Against Illicit Drugs-World Drug Day,  logistically supported by the United States, which achieved the largest public turnout for this  annual event since it was first held in 2003.  The event promoted drug demand reduction and  community engagement in fighting drug abuse, underscored various enforcement efforts, and  highlighted Liberian inter-agency security cooperation to combat drug trafficking and  transnational crime.  The 2018 event culminated in the public destruction (burning) of seized  drugs, an action widely covered in the media as it demonstrated a new level of transparency.   The LDEA destroyed 4.38 MT of marijuana,   $4.9\\,\\mathrm{kg}$   of cocaine and   $12.3\\;\\mathrm{kg}$   of heroin at this  event.  \n4.

Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  \nIn 2018, Mexico’s National Commission Against Addictions (CONADIC) released official  results from a national survey of drug, alcohol, and tobacco usage.  The study showed overall  marijuana use at 8.6 percent (up from 6 percent in 2011); stable cocaine use at 3.5 percent;  inhalants at 1.1 percent; and amphetamine-type stimulants at 0.9 percent.  There was no  indication of domestic fentanyl use in Mexico.    \nThe United States supports the implementation of court-supervised treatment for criminal  offenders with drug use problems in Mexico.  Currently, six Mexican states operate 30 drug  treatment courts including six juvenile courts, all of which receive training and assistance from  the Merida Initiative to facilitate court-supervised drug treatment and social reinsertion.  \n4.  Corruption  \nAs a matter of government policy, Mexico does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production  or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.   Nevertheless, corruption continues to impede Mexican drug control efforts.  Mexico’s National  Anti-Corruption System seeks to address impunity for corruption, but implementation is not yet  complete.  The Senate has not yet appointed a special anticorruption prosecutor or approved the  selection of the 18 administrative judges charged with ruling on corruption cases.    \nA joint working group between the new Lopez Obrador administration and civil society is  devoted to transforming the PGR into a new Fiscalia General de la Republica, which would  make the Attorney General’s Office autonomous from the Presidency.  In September, MORENA  submitted a bill to congress that would allot one year for the transition from PGR to the new  Fiscalia to begin, with 2022 as the completion date for the transition.    \nA number of high-ranking government officials faced corruption-related charges in 2018,  including five former governors currently in custody on pre-trial detention.  A sixth, former  Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, pleaded guilty to criminal association and money laundering  charges in September and received a sentence of nine years.  Federal and state authorities have  opened corruption investigations into former Governor of Nayarit Roberto Sandoval and former  Governor of Veracruz Flavino Rios.  In total, nearly 20 former governors have been sentenced,  face corruption charges, or are under formal investigation.  "}

Supply Reduction\n\nThere was no discernible change in the volume of drugs transiting Nicaragua in 2018. However,\nthere continues to be evidence of increased domestic drug use, increased illegal drug production\n(mainly of marijuana), and the existence of clandestine airstrips in remote areas of the country.\nThough some traffickers continue to smuggle illicit drugs through the isolated Caribbean Coast,\nmany trafficking organizations have shifted their operations to deep-water routes off the Pacific\nCoast using larger, longer-range transportation. This allows larger quantities of drugs to travel\nfurther out to sea, avoiding detection by law enforcement and the threat of pirates in the\nCaribbean regions.\n\nIllicit drugs are also trafficked via land and air. Beginning in April 2018, drug trafficking\norganizations changed their routes due to roadblocks raised during the political unrest.\nTraffickers temporarily utilized more sea vessels and aircraft as alternatives, but at the close of\n2018 there was evidence that traffickers were slowly returning to land routes.\n\nThe Nicaraguan government reported that it conducted 4,416 operations targeting local and\ninternational drug trafficking in 2018, a 44 percent reduction from the 7,833 operations\nconducted in 2017.

However, information sharing from Nicaragua is limited, and often not accurate or timely.    \nThe Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which  Nicaragua and the United States are both parties, facilitates the sharing of legal information  between countries.  In spite of being part of this treaty, cooperation in this area is not robust due  to the low volume of requests.  In the past, the Government of Nicaragua has rarely provided  assistance within requested time frames.   \nThe United States and Nicaragua are parties to an extradition treaty signed in 1905 and ratified in  1907, but the Nicaraguan Constitution bars the extradition of Nicaraguan citizens.  Cooperation  by the Government of Nicaragua with extradition requests has historically been very limited.  An  International Criminal Police Organization Red Notice is usually required for wanted individuals  in order for the Government of Nicaragua to cooperate with the United States in expelling non- Nicaraguan citizen fugitives.     \n2.  Supply Reduction  \nThere was no discernible change in the volume of drugs transiting Nicaragua in 2018.  However,  there continues to be evidence of increased domestic drug use, increased illegal drug production  (mainly of marijuana), and the existence of clandestine airstrips in remote areas of the country.   Though some traffickers continue to smuggle illicit drugs through the isolated Caribbean Coast,  many trafficking organizations have shifted their operations to deep-water routes off the Pacific  Coast using larger, longer-range transportation.  This allows larger quantities of drugs to travel  further out to sea, avoiding detection by law enforcement and the threat of pirates in the  Caribbean regions.   \nIllicit drugs are also trafficked via land and air.  Beginning in April 2018, drug trafficking  organizations changed their routes due to roadblocks raised during the political unrest.  Traffickers temporarily utilized more sea vessels and aircraft as alternatives, but at the close of  2018 there was evidence that traffickers were slowly returning to land routes.   \nThe Nicaraguan government reported that it conducted 4,416 operations targeting local and  international drug trafficking in 2018, a 44 percent reduction from the 7,833 operations  conducted in 2017.  The government also reported seizing 2.58 metric tons (MT) of cocaine  during the first nine months of 2018, a 46 percent decrease from the 4.8 MT seized in all 2017.   The Nicaraguan Navy reported seizing 725 kilograms of the total cocaine seized in the country.   "}

Though the amount cultivated\nthroughout much of Peru decreased in 2017, increased cultivation in the Valley of the Rivers\nApurimac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM) negated the successes realized in the remainder of the\ngrowing region.

The areas of Apurimac and\nPuno account for two-thirds of the country’s cultivation.

Eradication efforts in the VRAEM are complicated by limited access and  significant security challenges that threaten the safety of eradicators.  The areas of Apurimac and  Puno account for two-thirds of the country’s cultivation.  Despite this, Peru has demonstrated  great successes in alternative development and eradication programs as represented by the  decreases in coca cultivation and cocaine production outside of the VRAEM.    \nPeruvian cocaine is trafficked throughout South America, traveling to Europe, East Asia,  Mexico, and the United States.  In addition to coca cultivation, Peru is a major importer of  precursor chemicals for cocaine production.  Following former President Pedro Pablo  Kuczynski’s resignation in March 2018, President Martín Vizcarra’s government has maintained  the commitment to implementing Peru’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy eradication goals.   During the first nine months of 2018, Peru’s coca eradication force (CORAH) eradicated 20,843  ha, completing 83 percent of its annual goal of 25,000 ha.  The military and the Peruvian  National Police’s (PNP) anti-drug unit (DIREJANDRO) conducted joint counter-drug operations  in the VRAEM.  Peru approved the VRAEM Strategy 2021, which involves heavy investment in  development but does not include eradication operations in the region.   \nThe terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), relying upon cocaine trafficking for  funding, maintains a strong hold in the VRAEM.  In 2018, the group killed four military  personnel and four police officers, and continued to provide a safe haven for drug traffickers.  \nB.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  \n1.  Institutional Development  \nThe Peruvian government’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy includes goals for eradication,  interdiction, and alternative development.  It also addresses the control of precursor chemicals,  organized crime, money laundering, and the rule of law.  In 2018, the Government of Peru  allocated   $\\S134$   million towards implementation of this strategy,  $\\S16.5$   million less than  2017.   Peru contributed   $\\S21.2$   million towards eradication efforts and concomitant aviation  support in 2018, which is equivalent to its 2017 contribution.    "}

The PDEA effectively collaborated with  the DDB on drug control and prevention in 2018.  Other executive branch entities, the judiciary,  and local government units played an increasingly important role in drug control policy, though  these efforts were at times disjointed and uncoordinated.  In order to bring together these  multiple efforts under one comprehensive strategy, the Dangerous Drugs Board drafted a  Philippine Anti-Drug Strategy, which was formally approved by President Duterte via executive  order on October 29.  Implementation on this strategy will begin in early 2019.    \nThe use of plea bargains in drug cases resumed after the Supreme Court struck down as  unconstitutional a 2002 provision barring their use in late 2017.  However, inadequate  coordination between the treatment facilities, law enforcement, and the judiciary have challenged  the plea bargain’s effective implementation.  Restrictions imposed by the 1965 Anti-Wiretapping  Act, which bars the use of intercepted criminal communications in court, remained in place.  The  Philippines are party to both an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty with the  United States, and regularly coordinates extradition and mutual legal assistance requests.   Cooperation is excellent, although bureaucratic procedures slow execution of the requests.  The  Philippines maintains a cooperative relationship with international partners, including the United  States, on transnational drug interdictions and demand reduction.    "}

Spanish authorities estimate that 9.5 percent of Spaniards consume cannabis and two percent  consume cocaine.    \nSpain continued to enjoy excellent bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with  international partners in 2018.  Cooperation on EU operations in the Mediterranean continued,  and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintained strong working relationships with Spanish police  and customs authorities, leading to significant drug seizures and arrests.  November 2018,  Spain’s parliament approved new legislation to ban certain small high-speed watercraft from  Spanish waters.  The law provides for the creation of a registry for exempted boats of this type –  which are frequently used to smuggle illicit drugs, especially in the vicinity of the Strait of  Gibraltar – and permits Spanish customs to seize unregistered ships regardless of whether drugs  or other contraband are found onboard.

During the year, Tanzanian authorities  demonstrated increased interdiction capacity with several seizures resulting from authorities’  quick response to real time intelligence.  In several incidents, Tanzanian citizens were arrested  for narcotics trafficking in various African and Asian countries.    \nTanzania’s geographical location, prevalence of corruption, and porous borders present  considerable challenges to drug interdiction.  Traffickers exploit Tanzania’s 854 mile coastline  and inadequate security at Tanzanian seaports.  Southwest Asian heroin is transported in multi- hundred kilogram quantities by small vessels to Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coastline.  Large  quantities of heroin transit Tanzania’s land border with Kenya for transshipment to Europe and  North America.  Smaller amounts (three to five kilograms) are trafficked to Europe, India, and  North America from Dar es Salaam via commercial flights and air cargo.  South American  cocaine is trafficked into Tanzania by air for further international distribution.  Tanzania  produces cannabis and khat for domestic consumption and regional distribution.  \nThe Tanzanian Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA), the Tanzania Intelligence and  Security Service (TISS), the Tanzanian Police Service’s Anti-Narcotics Unit, the Tanzanian  Peoples Defence Force (TPDF), and Tanzanian Maritime Police contribute to Tanzania’s fight  against illicit drug trafficking.  These agencies work with U.S. and other international law  enforcement partners.  Regional cooperation on drug interdiction is improving.  \nExtradition between Tanzania and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K.  Extradition Treaty.  There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between Tanzania and the  United States, though both countries are parties to various multilateral conventions with  provisions for assistance.  \nThe Government of Tanzania does not encourage or facilitate the production or trafficking of  illicit drugs as a matter of policy, but corruption remains a barrier to effective enforcement.   Drug traffickers use their considerable financial resources to influence politicians, law  enforcement officers, and others in positions of power.   \nThe United States promotes improved interdiction operations through law enforcement  cooperation and by encouraging a strong Tanzanian government commitment to drug  interdiction, combatting corruption, and improving criminal justice and rule of law.

CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean  nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit drug trafficking, advance public safety and citizen  security, and promote justice.  The Trinidad and Tobago government is an active partner in CBSI  programs.   \nThrough CBSI, the United States continues to provide training and support to law enforcement  and security agencies responsible for drug control, including the Police Service, Transnational  Organized Crime Unit, Customs and Excise Division, Prison Service, and Coast Guard.  This  support, together with joint law enforcement cooperation on drug trafficking investigations,  resulted in a number of substantial drug seizures in 2018.  In May, for example, the Trinidad and  Tobago Police Service’s Organized Crime and Intelligence Unit arrested and charged five airport  personnel for attempting to smuggle   $86.8\\;\\mathrm{kg}$   of cocaine – with an estimated street value of  approximately  $\\S34$   million – bound for New York from Trinidad’s Piarco International Airport.   \nThe United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to suppress illicit  traffic by sea and air.  This agreement includes provisions for ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit,  entry to investigate, and over flight of territorial seas.  \nD.  Conclusion  \nThe United States and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy a cooperative relationship against drug  trafficking and transnational organized crime.  The individuals and units working to combat drug  trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago, however, continue to face considerable institutional  challenges.  The Trinidad and Tobago government should continue to implement reforms to  improve the capacity of its law enforcement and criminal justice institutions to detect drug  trafficking and effectively investigate, arrest, and prosecute suspected drug traffickers in a timely  manner.

National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives \nUzbekistan’s drug control strategy seeks to increase the institutional capacity of the country’s  law enforcement and criminal justice institutions through training.  In 2018, the U.S. government  provided training and equipment to assist the Uzbek government to modernize its border  crossing checkpoints, improve forensic capabilities, develop judicial capacity, and enhance the  effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.  However, the agreements between the DEA and  Uzbek agencies have not translated into significant operational cooperation.  Since closing its  office in Uzbekistan in 2017, the DEA maintains liaison relationship from the regional DEA  office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.   \nD. Conclusion  \nDrug control cooperation between the United States and Uzbekistan continued to grow slowly in  2018.  Uzbekistan made progress in regional cooperation and data sharing with CARICC  members and the United States.  However, given the lack of independent data on drug use and  trafficking within the country, it is difficult to estimate the true extent of the problem and  whether Uzbekistan’s low seizure statistics accurately reflect law enforcement efficacy.   Sustainable anti-corruption practices, an independent drug use study, and increased exposure to  international best practices could promote sustainable improvements in Uzbekistan’s ability to  combat transnational drug trafficking.
