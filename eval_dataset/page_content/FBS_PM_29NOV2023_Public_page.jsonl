PM’s efforts to maximize the competitive advantages of the U.S.  national security innovation base help ensure the U.S. military’s technological  superiority, deepen security cooperation with allies and partners, improve  interoperability, and influence the international standards for nonproliferation and  technology transfer.  PM champions U.S. defense industry abroad, building long-term  defense relationships with allies and partners to address shared security concerns.   Furthermore, a strong domestic defense industry contributes to domestic economic  renewal by expanding U.S. manufacturing and creating high-wage, high-skill jobs.      PM works to safeguard America’s military advantage by protecting U.S. defense  technologies from exploitation, diversion, or misuse through the judicious review of  arms transfers, end-use monitoring, investment screening, and engagement with the  U.S. defense innovation base, to include universities. PM advances export control  regulatory reforms to make U.S. export controls more comprehensible and user-friendly  to both foreign partners and U.S. industry, and ensures technologies controlled on the  U.S. Munitions List (USML) provide the United States with a critical military or  intelligence advantage. PM actively engages with Allies and partners on export controls,  including end-user and end-use obligations for defense technology and equipment.  Bilateral and multilateral engagement is increasingly important since supply chains are  globally interconnected –   creating both benefits that unite allies and partners but also  risks when supply chains grow dependent on single-points of failure or become  vulnerable to exploitation.
