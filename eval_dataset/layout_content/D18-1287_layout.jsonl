Our representation of goal prediction is easily interpretable, while not requiring the de- sign of logical ontologies and symbolic represen- tations. A potential limitation of our approach is cascading errors. Action generation relies com- pletely on the predicted goal and is not exposed to the language otherwise. This also suggests a second related limitation: the model is unlikely to successfully reason about instructions that in- clude constraints on the execution itself. While the model may reach the ﬁnal goal correctly, it is unlikely to account for the intermediate trajectory constraints. As we show (Table  2 ), such instruc- tions are common in our data. These two limita- tions may be addressed by allowing action genera- tion access to the instruction. Achieving this while retaining an interpretable goal representation that clearly determines the execution is an important direction for future work. Another important open question concerns automated evaluation, which re- mains especially challenging when instructions do not only specify goals, but also constraints on how to achieve them.
