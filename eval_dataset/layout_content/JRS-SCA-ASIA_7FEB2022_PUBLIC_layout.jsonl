Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only  remaining countries with wild polio virus.   India has the world's highest incidence of  tuberculosis (TB) accounting for more than a quarter of the global TB burden, and the  largest burden of multi-drug-resistant TB.  Region-wide, non-communicable diseases are  the leading cause of morbidity and mortality.  This puts an enormous burden on health  care financing and lost labor participation.   Furthermore, the humanitarian and  economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have deepened challenges to  alleviating poverty; improving food security; advancing gender equality; building  prosperity; attracting investment; ensuring domestic security and stability; advancing  political and socioeconomic reforms; and strengthening democratic structures.  Neither  South Asia nor Central Asia have regional organizations to build regional capacity,  information sharing, epidemiological surveillance, convergence of regulations, or other  public health functions.  Gaps are filled to some extent by the World Health  Organization’s (WHO) regional offices covering South Asia, Afghanistan and Pakistan,  and Central Asia.

SCA countries are some of the most vulnerable to impacts  of climate change; face increased water shortages; ocean acidification; sea-level rise;  loss of habitats and environmental destruction; increased exposure to zoonotic diseases  and pathogens; climate-driven migration; food insecurity, lack of resilient infrastructure;  and risks of conflict.  The World Bank estimates climate change will push 40 million  people in South Asia to migrate within their own countries by 2050 from areas with  lower water availability and crop productivity, including those affected by rising sea  levels and storm surges.  SCA countries are also grappling with how to promote  sustainable economic development without exacerbating these vulnerabilities.  Rapid  population growth and development are driving increased demand for energy, water,  food, and transportation, thereby increasing both carbon emissions and air pollution  and reducing available water supplies.  The region is home to the world’s third largest  greenhouse gas emitter.  It also has both large producers and growing consumers of  fossil fuels, so mitigation measures must accompany adaptation measures to limit the  global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

The United States must work with partners in the  region to support the basic needs of refugees, so that they can peacefully co-exist with  host-country communities for the duration of their stay and resist dangers of  radicalization to violence.  Disasters and crises exacerbate gender inequalities, affecting       women and girls.

Many SCA countries are dependent on regional powers such as Russia, People’s  Republic of China, and India for security, economic growth, and maintaining the political  status-quo.

Climate  impacts in SCA, such as high levels of air pollution from automobile combustion and  flooding from rising sea levels, create social and economic costs, including negative  health effects for people and stalled economic activity.  However, multiple SCA  countries have strong potential for renewable energy generation and have updated  their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) to include an increase in the utilization  of renewable energy as a means to increase their climate ambitions and contribution to  limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.  To  achieve this goal, SCA countries will need increasing access to innovative, decarbonized  energy systems.  U.S. companies are at the forefront of clean energy technology  innovations and can provide solutions to the increased clean energy demand center of  SCA, which will have both climate-related and economic benefits for SCA and the United  States.  This objective also supports the State-USAID JSP Strategic Objective 2.3.

India is one of the largest markets for climate  technologies such as renewable energy and climate-smart infrastructure and can play a  key role in demonstrating, scaling, and driving down the costs of the innovative  solutions needed to address and adapt to climate change.  India’s leadership can  demonstrate how the world can align swift climate action with inclusive and resilient  economic development.  The United States will work bilaterally with India and  multilaterally through mechanisms such as the Quad and CRDI to catalyze India’s climate  leadership by supporting India to achieve its domestic climate commitments and  encourage India to be a partner in advancing clean energy transitions and adaptation  measures globally .

Keeping in reach the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius is  necessary to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Instability in energy markets,  political dynamics, slower than anticipated economic recovery, and inability to access  the level of technical and financial resources needed can hinder India’s ability to pursue  ambitious climate action at home and abroad.  Without India’s continued and elevated  climate leadership on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and advancing innovative  clean energy and adaptation solutions, global efforts to halt the worst impacts of  climate change will fall short.
