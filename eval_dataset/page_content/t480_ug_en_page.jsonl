LCD 面板 (LED 背光源) - LCD Panel (LED Backlight Source)\n5. 键盘 - Keyboard\n6. 内存 - Memory\n7. 电池 - Battery\n8. 电源适配器 - Power Adapter\n9. 底壳、顶盖和扬声器 - Bottom Case, Top Cover, and Speaker\n\n### Symbols:\n- X: Indicates the presence of the substance in the component.\n- O: Indicates the absence or compliance of the substance in the component.\n\nIn this table, all listed components have an 'X' under the '铅 (Pb)' column indicating the presence of lead, whereas the other substances (汞 (Hg), 镉 (Cd), 六价铬 (Cr(VI)), 多溴联苯 (PBB), 多溴二苯醚 (PBDE)) all have an 'O', indicating compliance with the standards (absence or within permissible limits).\n\n\n\n\nThe image contains Japanese text at the top that reads \"図示,\" which translates to \"illustration\" or \"diagram\" in English. Below this text is a circular design featuring two arrows forming a circle and the number \"10\" in the center. This symbol could indicate a concept related to cycles, rotation, or a process that involves 10 steps or iterations, but without additional context, the precise meaning remains unclear.\n"}
