DALE KILDEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN\nCONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN\n\nMr. KILDEE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much\nfor having this very important hearing.

One objective is to purchase products as part of the Depart- ment’s price-support and surplus-removal programs. The second is to provide  schools with high quality, nutritious foods so that children have access to meals that  are both healthful and appealing. These objectives are frequently at odds, which  poses an ongoing challenge for the Department. Because the Department is charged  with stabilizing agriculture markets, children’s preferences, food quality and nutri- tion must frequently compete with economic factors when the Department decides  which commodities to purchase and supply.  \nIn 1999, USDA undertook a broad evaluation of its commodity procurement and  distribution systems to improve food distribution to schools and other beneficiaries.  The Department’s ultimate goal was to better serve producers and consumers by im- proving both the efficiency of the distribution process and the quality of foods deliv- ered. USDA convened a blue ribbon panel, Food Distribution 2000, which included  representatives from industry, schools, and State commodity distribution agencies.  The result was a report that made many valuable recommendations for improving  USDA’s food distribution system.  \nSince that time, the Department has created a number of pilot programs and  other initiatives to improve upon the current system. However, additional efforts are  needed and several recommendations have yet to be implemented. Last month, I  sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman requesting information about  the Department’s efforts to implement the recommendations of the Food Distribu- tion 2000 panel. I look forward to working with Secretary Veneman, Under Sec- retary for Food and Nutrition, Eric Bost, Agriculture Marketing Service Adminis- trator, A.J. Yates, our partners in the food industry, and school food service pro- viders to continue the good work that has been started in making meaningful re- forms to the commodity distribution system.  \nToday, we will hear from experts who will help shed light on commodity distribu- tion to child nutrition programs—what works well and what needs improvement.  Several of today’s witnesses will tell us about progress made by the Department to  act upon the recommendations of the Food Distribution 2000 report and how Con- gress can help. I am certain all of today’s witnesses will offer unique perspectives  on child nutrition and program operations that will be tremendously helpful to the  Members of this Committee as we work to improve these programs. We look forward  to their comments.  \nWith that, I would like to recognize the Committee’s distinguished Ranking Mem- ber, Mr. Miller.  \nSTATEMENT OF HON. DALE KILDEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN  CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MICHIGAN  \nMr. K ILDEE . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much  for having this very important hearing. I have been involved with  child nutrition since about 1954, when I became a teacher. I see  people are there in the background that I have known since I have  been here in Congress, 27 years. It is certainly a very, very impor- tant program.  \nSome people forget that the program really began after World  War II when it was discovered that many people entering the mili- tary in the draft at that time were physically unable to enter the  military because of poor nutrition. Of course, many of them had  grown up during the 1930’s, when we had the Great Depression.  So it really became apparent to the Federal Government, Franklin  Roosevelt, and before him, Harry Truman, that nutrition was very,  very important for the long-term health of young people and for the  long-term health of this Nation.  \nI have been through every permutation that this program has  gone under, cash in lieu of commodities, everything, every per- mutation of that. But generally speaking, the Federal Government  has kept its commitment. There are times when we had some prob- lems with trying to call ketchup a vegetable and things like that,  which we do muse about from time to time. But generally, all of  the Administrations have been aware of the fact that this is a very,  very important program.  "}

There has been considerable attention paid to the fat,\nsodium, and sugar content of these meals. I would like to assure the Committee of\nour continuing and abiding concern in this area. The Department has reviewed and\nmodified the recipes, commodity specifications and other materials that support\ncompliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\n\nUSDA has worked with schools to more closely align the meals they serve with\nthe Dietary Guidelines. Today, over 80 percent of NSLP schools offer meals that are\nconsistent with good health. We have worked hard to improve the quality, variety,\nand nutritional content of the commodities we provide to schools and will continue\nto make improvements in the future. At the same time, we are strongly encouraging\nschools to offer more nutritious choices to students and we are providing food serv-\nice workers with the training and technical assistance to help them prepare more\nnutritious and appealing meals.\n\nAs many of you recall, back in the 1990’s, the Department became aware of a\ngrowing gap between the way we were delivering our commodity support to schools\nand the way States, schools and industry could most efficiently and safely produce,\ndeliver, store and serve a quality product. We asked our partners in industry, the\nState, and local agencies for their suggestions in order to identify how we could close\nthis gap, and we incorporated these recommendations, along with our own, into a\nreport entitled, “Food Distribution 2000,” and used it as a blueprint for change.\n\nRecognizing and Responding to a Challenge\n\nThe Food Distribution 2000 Report identified numerous ways in which USDA’s\ncommodity program for schools was overly cumbersome and burdened with red tape.\nCommodity ordering was handled by seven different regional offices, rather than\ncentrally at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service headquarters. Orders were sub-\nmitted on paper, not electronically.\n\nThe Department’s program was significantly out of step with commercial prac-\ntices.

There has been considerable attention paid to the fat,  sodium, and sugar content of these meals. I would like to assure the Committee of  our continuing and abiding concern in this area. The Department has reviewed and  modified the recipes, commodity specifications and other materials that support  compliance with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.  \nUSDA has worked with schools to more closely align the meals they serve with  the Dietary Guidelines. Today, over 80 percent of NSLP schools offer meals that are  consistent with good health. We have worked hard to improve the quality, variety,  and nutritional content of the commodities we provide to schools and will continue  to make improvements in the future. At the same time, we are strongly encouraging  schools to offer more nutritious choices to students and we are providing food serv- ice workers with the training and technical assistance to help them prepare more  nutritious and appealing meals.  \nAs many of you recall, back in the 1990’s, the Department became aware of a  growing gap between the way we were delivering our commodity support to schools  and the way States, schools and industry could most efficiently and safely produce,  deliver, store and serve a quality product. We asked our partners in industry, the  State, and local agencies for their suggestions in order to identify how we could close  this gap, and we incorporated these recommendations, along with our own, into a  report entitled, ‘‘Food Distribution 2000,’’ and used it as a blueprint for change.  \nRecognizing and Responding to a Challenge  \nThe Food Distribution 2000 Report identified numerous ways in which USDA’s  commodity program for schools was overly cumbersome and burdened with red tape.  Commodity ordering was handled by seven different regional offices, rather than  centrally at USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service headquarters. Orders were sub- mitted on paper, not electronically.  \nThe Department’s program was significantly out of step with commercial prac- tices. Vendors were required to use USDA labels on commodities, which entailed  running separate production lines and no interchangeable products. The Depart- ment required States and recipient agencies to maintain separate inventories for  USDA products and account for them aside from commercial products. Specifications  for USDA commodities often deviated from the specifications commonly used for  commercial products. The vendor contracting process—short-term lowest cost con- tract awards—made USDA the customer of last resort and created inconsistent and  unpredictable product quality and service.  \nOther key issues the report addressed were how USDA agencies could better co- ordinate their efforts, improve food safety protocols, and promote fresh fruits and  vegetables.  \nI am pleased to report that USDA has addressed each of the issues raised by the  Food Distribution 2000 Report, took action, and has now implemented most of the  Report’s recommendations, some of which I would like to share with you this after- noon.  \nMaking Commodity Programs More Responsive to Customer Needs  \nTo make our commodity programs more responsive to our customers, USDA has  implemented an Internet-based commodity ordering system called the Electronic  Commodity Ordering System (ECOS). This new system provides greater access,  speed and transparency to the food distribution process at the Federal, State, and  recipient agency levels. States can now place, cancel, or modify food orders online  that previously were handled by paper transactions. We plan to roll the system out  to schools, at the State’s option, beginning next year.  \nAligning Commodity Programs with Commercial Practices  \nTo bring our commodity programs more in line with commercial practices, USDA  now:  •  Allows vendors to use commercial labels on USDA commodities in lieu of USDA  labels;  •  Permits recipient agencies to maintain single inventory records, instead of re- quiring separate accounting for USDA commodities and commercial products;  and  •  Reviews all USDA commodity specifications, and improves/modifies them when  feasible, to better align them with commercial specifications.  \nWe have revised regulations to allow for full substitution of all commodities, with  the exception of beef and pork, and with limited substitution for poultry products.  Substitution allows processors more flexibility in scheduling production. Through  the use of the Standard Yield Program, schools can now obtain seamless distribu- tion of commodities and commercial purchases.  "}

Since those days, and\nin keeping with our Dietary Guidelines, we have established much more healthful\nstandards for canned fruits and vegetables offered in our nutrition programs. The\nsodium specifications for the vegetables we offer to schools are the minimum\namount possible that still assures palatability of the products.

Under this program, participating schools nationwide order fresh\nproduce directly from DoD prime vendors. In fiscal year 2003, USDA purchased $50\nmillion worth of fresh produce for schools and the program has proven to be very\npopular in the 41 States that took part in it last year.\n\nImproving USDA Inter-Agency Coordination\n\nFood Distribution 2000 has been a collective and unprecedented effort of four\nUSDA agencies.

Al- though weekly meal patterns must meet Federal standards, local school authorities  make the decisions about what specific foods to serve and how they are prepared.  Moreover, USDA commodities comprise less than 20 percent of the food products put  on schoolchildrens plates.  \nAMS and FSA are responsible for issuing and accepting bids and awarding and  administering contracts. FNS is responsible for taking commodity orders from  States, monitoring purchases and entitlements throughout the year, and the overall  administration of the commodity nutrition programs.  \nActual purchasing begins with AMS and FSA notifying specific industries through  press releases and other means of their intent to purchase particular food products.  The agencies invite bids under a formally advertised competitive bid program. These  ‘‘invitations’’ give specific details on when bids are due for a particular purchase.  All products must be U.S.-produced and of domestic origin.  "}
