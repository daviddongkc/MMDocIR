{"layout": 46, "type": "text", "text": "Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere  $5.55\\%$  , up from   $5.39\\%$   a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each    $0.1\\%$   of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to  \\$100 million . We spent  no  Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It’s important to understand that only  dividends  from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us  $\\S785$   million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering   $\\S5.6$   billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well. BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar. Your railroad had record earnings of \\$6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated  after  interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” to earnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..) BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad. BHE, our final Giant, earned a record  $\\S4$   billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the    $\\S I22$   million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns   $91.1\\%$   of the company. BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had no  wind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant in the huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE has become a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmission throughout much of the United States. Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is not in any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing its plans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since  2007 . To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that the company has  long  been making climate-conscious moves that soak up  all  of its earnings. More opportunities lie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projects that our country needs.
