The 2020 edition of the National Building Code allows  construction of encapsulated mass timber buildings of up to 12 stories, with certain  conditions. Wood-first legislation has been adopted in British Columbia, and a federal  version is currently before the federal parliament.    \nI.

As well, most major municipalities in Prince Edward  Island have also adopted the National Building Code.  In addition, it has been largely adopted  by the three territories: the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon.   "}

Building a Regulatory Framework\n\nAll building work and construction is governed by New Zealand’s Building Code.'2 As set out\nby the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Building Code sets out\nstandards that should be met with respect to matters including durability, structural stability,\naccess, energy efficiency, and protection from fire. It is considered a “ performance-based Building\nCode,” in that it sets standards for how buildings should perform as opposed to specifications on\nhow they must be designed or constructed.13\n\nThe overall regulatory framework is set through the Building Act 2004, which specifies, “all\nbuilding work must comply with the building code,” and the Building Regulations 1992, which\nset out the Building Code in Schedule 1.5 Each year the Building Code is updated through a\nconsultation process that allows both the public and private sectors to provide feedback on any\nchanges proposed, with each update available through the MBIE.'¢ While it appears that no\nchanges have been proposed specifically with respect to CLT, the 2022 changes include updates\nregarding fire protection.!”\n\nA relatively recent administrative decision addressing the use of CLT in New Zealand indicates\nthat, under the Building Code, the authorities look to whether a structure meets performance\nrequirements as opposed to the use of particular materials. In a 2018 case before the Ministry of\nBusiness, Innovation and Employment, the ministry considered whether certain glazing panels\ncould be used in a CLT structure. While the matter did not consider the use of CLT, its reasoning\nindicates that the determination was one that considered the adequacy of the plans submitted.'*\n\n11 Mid-Rise Wood Construction, Carbon Zero Wood, midrisewood.co.nz.\n\n?

Building a Regulatory Framework  \nAll building work and construction is governed by New Zealand’s Building Code.  As set out  by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Building Code sets out  standards that should be met with respect to matters including durability, structural stability,  access, energy efficiency, and protection from fire. It is considered a “performance-based Building  Code,” in that it sets standards for how buildings should perform as opposed to specifications on  how they must be designed or constructed.    \nThe overall regulatory framework is set through the Building Act 2004, which specifies, “all  building work must comply with the building code,” 14  and the Building Regulations 1992, which  set out the Building Code in Schedule 1.  Each year the Building Code is updated through a  consultation process that allows both the public and private sectors to provide feedback on any  changes proposed, with each update available through the MBIE.  While it appears that no  changes have been proposed specifically with respect to CLT, the 2022 changes include updates  regarding fire protection.    \nA relatively recent administrative decision addressing the use of CLT in New Zealand indicates  that, under the Building Code, the authorities look to whether a structure meets performance  requirements as opposed to the use of particular materials.   In a 2018 case before the Ministry of  Business, Innovation and Employment, the ministry considered whether certain glazing panels  could be used in a CLT structure. While the matter did not consider the use of CLT, its reasoning  indicates that the determination was one that considered the adequacy of the plans submitted.   "}
