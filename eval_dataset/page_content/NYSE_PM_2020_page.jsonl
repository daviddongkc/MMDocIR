This\nreflected the consistent, broad-based and increasingly profitable\ngrowth of /QOS, solid pricing for combustible tobacco products\noutside Indonesia, and significant cost efficiencies. We also\nachieved several important milestones, notably the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration’s authorization of a version of |QOS as a\nModified Risk Tobacco Product (MRTP).\n\nAs we look back on the year, we must first and foremost salute\nthe enormous efforts of the entire PMI organization to keep our\nemployees and their families safe, ensure business continuity,\nrapidly adapt our ways of working and help our local communities.\n\n2020 vs. 2019 Results\n\nThe industry backdrop was very challenging, as pandemic-linked\nconfinements and other restrictions led to reduced adult smoker\ndaily tobacco consumption, temporary disruptions of both our\nsupply chain and the retail trade in certain markets, a severe\ndecline in our duty-free business, and the exacerbation of market\nheadwinds in Indonesia.\n\nNonetheless, our 2020 results represent an outstanding\ndelivery by the organization under severe constraints, including\nthe management of the business through remote working for the\nmajority of the year.\n\nTotal cigarette and heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment\nvolume of 704.6 billion units decreased by 8.1%, or by 7.9% ona\nlike-for-like\" basis, reflecting lower cigarette volume, mainly due to\nindustry-wide COVID-related disruption, particularly in the second\nquarter. HTU shipment volume increased by 27.6%, to 76.1 billion\nunits, driven by the strong growth of QOS.\n\nTotal cigarette and HTU market share declined by 0.7\npercentage points, to 27.7% of the international market, excluding\nChina and the U.S., reflecting a lower share for cigarettes —\nmainly due to Indonesia and PMI Duty Free, which accounted\nfor a 0.8-percentage-point decline — partly offset by the strong\nperformance of our HTU brands, whose international share\nincreased by 0.8 percentage points to reach 3.0%.\n\nNet revenues of $28.7 billion decreased by 3.7%. On an organic\nbasis, net revenues declined by 1.6%, due primarily to unfavorable\ncombustible tobacco volume/mix — which was exacerbated by\npandemic-related headwinds — partly offset by higher HTU\nshipment volume and favorable combustible tobacco pricing.\n\nAdjusted operating income (Ol) of $117 billion decreased\nby 0.5%. On an organic basis, adjusted Ol increased by 4.6%,\ndriven by: the growing weight of [QOS in our business; significant\nefficiencies related to manufacturing and operating costs; and\nthe optimization, digitalization and greater utilization of our\nsmoke-free-product commercial infrastructure. Adjusted Ol\nmargin increased by 240 basis points on an organic basis.\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS of $5.17 decreased by 0.4%. On an organic\nbasis, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 7.0%.\n\nOperating cash flow of $9.8 billion decreased by $0.3 billion,\nor 2.8%. On a currency-neutral, like-for-like basis, operating cash\nflow increased by 3.5%.\n\nIn September, the Board of Directors approved a 2.6% increase\nin the quarterly dividend, to an annualized rate of $4.80 per share.\nThis represented the thirteenth consecutive year in which we\nincreased our dividend since becoming a public company in 2008.\n\nDelivering a Smoke-Free Future\nIQOS continued its strong performance in 2020. We closed the\nyear with an estimated 17.6 million total [QOS users,’ of which\n\napproximately 12.7 million have switched to [QOS and stopped\nsmoking.' Importantly, smoke-free products accounted for almost\none-quarter of our total net revenues for the year. This growing\nweight provides a powerful tailwind to our top- and bottom-line\nfinancial performance.\n\nWe added more /QOS users in 2020 than in the previous year,\nwith our accelerated shift to digital and remote engagement\nhelping to mitigate the pandemic-related impact on /QOS user\nacquisition. This supported strong HTU volume growth in the\nEU, Japan and Russia, only partly offset by Duty Free due to the\npandemic-related decline in international travel. By year-end,\nIQOS was commercialized in 64 markets.\n\nComplementing our [QOS heat-not-burn product offering,\nwe made important steps to expand our smoke-free portfolio\nin 2020 to provide adult smokers with an ever-broader range of\ntaste, price and technology choices. This included the launch of il\nSOLID in Russia and Ukraine and Ii! HYBRID in Japan, leveraging\nour global collaboration agreement with KT&G. We also began the\ninternational launch of our [QOS VEEV e-vapor product (pictured\non the back cover of this report) in New Zealand in August,\nfollowed by the Czech Republic in December.\n\nIn 2020, we maintained our relentless focus on consumer\ncentricity to enhance the experience along the entire consumer\njourney associated with our smoke-free products — from aware-\nness and understanding to full switching and advocacy. This drives\nour commercialization activities — covering channels and programs\n-and development activities, from both a product and brand\nperspective. A central element of this focus was our engagement\nwith consumers to collect timely, first-hand feedback to drive\nimprovements at each stage of consumer interaction.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s issuance, in July,\nof MRTP orders for the QOS Tobacco Heating System ([QOS\n2.4 device and three HTU variants) was a historic milestone for\nPMI, permitting the marketing of these products with reduced\nexposure claims in the U.S. and providing a strong reference for\nscience-based harm-reduction discussions in other jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, the FDA’s authorization of IQOS 3 via the premarket\ntobacco application (PMTA) pathway was another important step\nfor the tens of millions of men and women in the U.S. who smoke.\n\nThere were a number of important regulatory developments\ninternationally for smoke-free products in 2020. For example,\nGreece adopted an amendment to its tobacco regulation that\nsets forth a pre-approval regimen that allows the communication\nof scientifically substantiated messages to adult smokers. In\naddition, New Zealand included an amendment of its tobacco\nregulation in which non-combusted alternatives are clearly\ndifferentiated from smoking products.\n\nIn 2020, we extended our corporate “Unsmoke” campaign\nto include “Unsmoke Your Mind,” which communicates the\nimportance of creating a regulatory environment in which\ndecision-making is transparent, science based, and people\ncentric. In this vein, we held our first Open Science events,\nwhich showcased our latest scientific results and provided an\nopportunity to discuss — in a virtual setting — relevant topics with\nmore than 1,600 participants from 80 countries.\n\nCombustible Product Portfolio\n\nOur combustible tobacco portfolio showed resilience in 2020.\nWhile specific headwinds in Duty Free and Indonesia weighed on\nthe overall share of our cigarette brands, the share performance\nelsewhere was essentially stable net of |QOS-related cannibal-\nization.

Business.\nGeneral Development of Business\nGeneral\n\nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a Virginia holding company incorporated in 1987. We are a leading international tobacco company\nengaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes, as well as smoke-free products, associated electronic devices and accessories, and\nother nicotine-containing products in markets outside the United States of America. In addition, we ship versions of our Platform 1\ndevice and consumables to Altria Group, Inc. for sale under license in the United States, where these products have received\nmarketing authorizations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") under the premarket tobacco product application\n(\"PMTA\") pathway; the FDA has also authorized the marketing of a version of our Platform 1 device and its consumables as a\nModified Risk Tobacco Product (\"MRTP\"), finding that an exposure modification order for these products is appropriate to promote\nthe public health.\n\nWe are leading a transformation in the tobacco industry to create a smoke-free future, based on a new category of reduced-risk\nproducts that, while not risk free, are a much better choice than continuing to smoke. Our goal is to ultimately replace cigarettes with\nsmoke-free products to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, society, the company and its shareholders.\n\nReduced-risk products (\"RRPs\") is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to\npresent less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continuing smoking. We have a range of RRPs in various\nstages of development, scientific assessment and commercialization. Because our RRPs do not burn tobacco, they produce an aerosol\nthat contains far lower quantities of harmful and potentially harmful constituents than found in cigarette smoke. Through\nmultidisciplinary capabilities in product development, state-of-the-art facilities and scientific substantiation, we aim to ensure that our\nRRPs meet adult consumer preferences and rigorous regulatory requirements.\n\nOur JQOS smoke-free product brand portfolio includes heated tobacco and nicotine-containing vapor products. Our leading smoke-\nfree platform (\"Platform 1\") is a precisely controlled device into which a specially designed heated tobacco unit is inserted and heated\nto generate an aerosol. Heated tobacco units (\"HTU\") is the term we use to refer to heated tobacco consumables, which for us include\nour HEETS, HEETS Creations, HEETS Dimensions, HEETS Marlboro and HEETS FROM MARLBORO (defined collectively as\nHEETS), Marlboro Dimensions, Marlboro HeatSticks and Parliament HeatSticks, as well as the KT&G-licensed brands, Fiit and Miix\n(outside of Korea). Platform | was first introduced in Nagoya, Japan, in 2014. As of December 31, 2020, Platform | is available for\nsale in 64 markets in key cities or nationwide.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in more than 175 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share\nposition. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local\nbrands and is led by Marlboro, the world’s best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 37% of our total\n2020 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament. Our other leading\ninternational cigarette brands are Bond Street, Chesterfield, L&M, Lark and Philip Morris. These seven international cigarette brands\ncontributed approximately 79% of our cigarette shipment volume in 2020. We also own a number of important local cigarette brands,\nsuch as Dji Sam Soe, Sampoerna A and Sampoerna U in Indonesia, and Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines.\n\nSource of Funds — Dividends\n\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our direct and indirect subsidiaries. Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our\ncreditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of\ncreditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be recognized.

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality,\nbrand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and,\nincreasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American\nblend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro, L&M, Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield, which are the most popular across many\nof our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the JOOS\nbrand umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the\npremium-price category.\n\nThe competitive environment and our competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of\nconsumer confidence, competitors' introduction of lower-price products or innovative products, higher tobacco product taxes, higher\nabsolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate\ntobacco products and restricts adult consumer access to truthful and non-misleading information about our RRPs. Competitors include\nthree large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and\nlocal tobacco companies and, in some instances, state-owned tobacco enterprises, principally in Algeria, Egypt, the PRC, Taiwan,\nThailand and Vietnam. Industry consolidation and privatizations of state-owned enterprises have led to an overall increase in\ncompetitive pressures. Some competitors have different profit and volume objectives, and some international competitors are\nsusceptible to changes in different currency exchange rates. Certain new market entrants may alienate consumers from innovative\nproducts through inappropriate marketing campaigns, messaging and inferior product satisfaction, while not relying on scientific\nsubstantiation based on appropriate R&D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and\nextent of the dissemination of inaccurate and misleading information about our RRPs.\n\nProcurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In\n2020, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland.\nIn 2020, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI’s global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of\ntobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi,\nMozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe believe that there is an adequate supply of tobacco leaf in the world markets to satisfy our current and anticipated production\nrequirements.\n\nIn addition to tobacco leaf, we purchase a wide variety of direct materials from a total of approximately 400 suppliers. In 2020, our top\nten suppliers of direct materials combined represented approximately 55% of our total direct materials purchases. The three most\nsignificant direct materials that we purchase are printed paper board used in packaging, acetate tow used in filter making and fine\npaper used in the manufacturing of cigarettes and heated tobacco units.

Such restrictions could limit the success of our  RRPs.  \nOur RRPs and commercial activities for these products are designed for, and directed toward, current adult smokers and users of  nicotine-containing products, and not for non-smokers or youth. If nonetheless there is a significant usage of our products or  competitive products among youth or non-smokers, even in situations over which we have no control, our credibility may suffer, and  our efforts to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the commercialization of RRPs may be  significantly impacted. \nMoreover, the FDA’s premarket tobacco product and modified risk tobacco product authorizations of a version of our Platform 1  product are subject to strict marketing, reporting and other requirements. Although we have received these product authorizations from  the FDA, there is no guarantee that the product will remain authorized, particularly if there is a significant uptake in youth or non- smoker initiation. \nWe may be unsuccessful in our efforts to differentiate reduced-risk products and cigarettes with respect to taxation. \nTo date, we have been largely successful in demonstrating to regulators that our RRPs are not cigarettes due to the absence of  combustion, and as such they are generally taxed either as a separate category or as other tobacco products, which typically yields  more favorable tax rates than cigarettes. If we cease to be successful in these efforts, RRP unit margins may be adversely affected. \nRisks Related to Illicit Trade \nWe lose revenues as a result of counterfeiting, contraband, cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites,\" non-tax-paid volume  produced by local manufacturers, and counterfeiting of our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units. \nLarge quantities of counterfeit cigarettes are sold in the international market. We believe that  Marlboro  is the most heavily  counterfeited international cigarette brand, although we cannot quantify the revenues we lose as a result of this activity. In addition,  our revenues are reduced by contraband, legal cross-border purchases, \"illicit whites\" and non-tax-paid volume produced by local  manufacturers. Our revenues and consumer satisfaction with our Platform 1 device and heated tobacco units may be adversely affected  by counterfeit products that do not meet our product quality standards and scientific validation procedures.

Mix is a term used to refer to the proportionate value of premium-price brands to mid-price or low- price brands in any given market (product mix).  Mix can also refer to the proportion of shipment volume in more profitable markets  versus shipment volume in less profitable markets (geographic mix).   \nOur cost of sales consists principally of: tobacco leaf, non-tobacco raw materials, labor and manufacturing costs; shipping and  handling costs; and the cost of devices produced by third-party electronics manufacturing service providers.  Estimated costs  associated with device warranty programs are generally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized. \nOur marketing, administration and research costs include the costs of marketing and selling our products, other costs generally not  related to the manufacture of our products (including general corporate expenses), and costs incurred to develop new products.  The  most significant components of our marketing, administration and research costs are marketing and sales expenses and general and  administrative expenses. \nPhilip Morris International Inc. is a legal entity separate and distinct from its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Accordingly, our right,  and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is  subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of our company itself as a creditor may be  recognized.  As a holding company, our principal sources of funds, including funds to make payment on our debt securities, are from  the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries  currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions  that are otherwise compliant with law.

Our performance\nobligations are typically satisfied upon shipment or delivery to our customers. The company estimates the cost of sales returns based\non historical experience, and these estimates are immaterial. Estimated costs associated with warranty programs for /OOS devices are\ngenerally provided for in cost of sales in the period the related revenues are recognized, based on a number of factors, including\nhistorical experience, product failure rates and warranty policies. The transaction price is typically based on the amount billed to the\ncustomer and includes estimated variable consideration where applicable. Such variable consideration is typically not constrained and\nis estimated based on the most likely amount that PMI expects to be entitled to under the terms of the contracts with customers,\nhistorical experience of discount or rebate redemption, where relevant, and the terms of any underlying discount or rebate programs,\nwhich may change from time to time as the business and product categories evolve.\n\nInventories - Our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumptions about future demand and market\nconditions. The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory. We perform regular reviews of our\ninventory on hand, as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers, considering multiple factors, including demand\nforecasts, product life cycle, current sales levels, pricing strategy and cost trends. If our review indicates that inventories of raw\nmaterials, components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost\nexceeds net realizable value, we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations.\n\nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets Valuation - We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for\nimpairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review. While the company has the option to perform\na qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an\nimpairment exists, the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis. The impairment\nanalysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. If the\ncarrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. To determine the fair\nvalue of goodwill, we primarily use the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global companies within the tobacco\nindustry, supported by a discounted cash flow model. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our goodwill was $6.0 billion,\nwhich is related to ten reporting units, each of which consists of a group of markets with similar operating and economic\ncharacteristics. The estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of December 31, 2020. To\ndetermine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-\nroyalty method. We concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value. These\ndiscounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows, which are subject to\nchanges in business conditions, such as volumes and prices, costs to produce, discount rates and estimated capital needs. Management\nconsiders historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated, and we believe these assumptions\nare consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use. Since the March 28, 2008, spin-off from Altria\nGroup, Inc., we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets.\n\nMarketing Costs - We incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising, marketing, consumer\n\nengagement and trade promotions. The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S.\nGAAP. Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the\n\n22\n", "vlm_text": "Discussion and Analysis  \nCritical Accounting Estimates  \nItem 8, Note 2.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to our consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the  significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. In most instances, we  must use a particular accounting policy or method because it is the only one that is permitted under U.S. GAAP. \nThe preparation of financial statements requires that we use estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets,  liabilities, net revenues and expenses, as well as our disclosure of contingencies. If actual amounts differ from previous estimates, we  include the revisions in our consolidated results of operations in the period during which we know the actual amounts. Historically,  aggregate differences, if any, between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have not had a significant impact on our  consolidated financial statements. \nThe selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our Audit Committee. The following is a  discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our  consolidated financial statements: \nRevenue Recognition -  We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied.  Our primary performance obligation is the  distribution and sales of cigarettes and other nicotine-containing products, including reduced-risk products.

The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory.  We perform regular reviews of our  inventory on hand, as well as our future purchase commitments with our suppliers, considering multiple factors, including demand  forecasts, product life cycle, current sales levels, pricing strategy and cost trends.  If our review indicates that inventories of raw  materials, components or finished products have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or that inventory cost  exceeds net realizable value, we may be required to make adjustments that will impact the results of operations.  \nGoodwill and Non-Amortizable Intangible Assets Valuation -  We test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for  impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review.

The costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with U.S.  GAAP.  Recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the  judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program.   For volume-based incentives provided  to customers, management continually assesses and estimates, by customer, the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified  targets, and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made.  For other trade promotions, management relies on estimated  utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience.  Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any  individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash  flows.

Changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any\nindividual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position, results of operations or operating cash\nflows.\n\nEmployee Benefit Plans - As discussed in Item 8, Note 13. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements, we provide a range\nof benefits to our employees and retired employees, including pensions, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits\n(primarily severance). We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by U.S. GAAP. These\ncalculations include various actuarial assumptions, such as discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, compensation\nincreases, mortality, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make\nmodifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. As permitted by U.S.\nGAAP, any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods. We believe that the assumptions utilized in\ncalculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries.\n\nWeighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as\nfollows:\n\n2020 2019\nPension plans 0.56% 0.83%\nPostretirement plans 2.84% 3.28%\n\nWe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2021 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $300 million\nas compared with approximately $264 million in 2020, excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement\nprograms. The anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization of unrecognized actuarial gains/losses of $50 million,\ncoupled with higher service cost of $24 million, partially offset by lower interest cost of $18 million and higher expected return on\nplan assets of $17 million and other movements of $3 million.\n\nWeighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported\nfor the employee benefit plans. A fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2021 pension and postretirement\nexpense by approximately $80 million, and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2021 pension and\npostretirement expense by approximately $70 million. Similarly, a fifty-basis-point decrease (increase) in the expected return on plan\nassets would increase (decrease) our 2021 pension expense by approximately $40 million.\n\nIncome Taxes - Income tax provisions for jurisdictions outside the United States, as well as state and local income tax provisions, are\ndetermined on a separate company basis, and the related assets and liabilities are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe extent of our operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a\nmultitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in\nvarious jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. In accordance with the\nauthoritative guidance for income taxes, we evaluate potential tax exposures and record tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues\nbased on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. We adjust these reserves in light of changing\nfacts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a\npayment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less\nthan the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less\nthan the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we\ndetermine the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\nWe are required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income. If we determine,\nusing all available evidence, that we do not reach the more likely than not threshold for recovery, a valuation allowance is recorded.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets including\nestimates of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions and the feasibility of on-going tax planning strategies, as applicable.\n\nThe effective tax rates used for interim reporting are based on our full-year geographic earnings mix projections. Changes in currency\n\nexchange rates, earnings mix by taxing jurisdiction or future regulatory developments may have an impact on the effective tax rates.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions.\n\n23\n", "vlm_text": "\nEmployee Benefit Plans -  As discussed in Item 8, Note 13.

These challenges, which are discussed below and in “Cautionary Factors That May\nAffect Future Results,” include:\n\n* regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other\nnicotine-containing products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult\nconsumers, or even ban certain of our products;\n\n* — fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures;\n\n+ illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called\n“illicit whites”;\n\n* intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers;\n\n* pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17. Contingencies; and\n\n* — governmental investigations.\n\nRegulatory Restrictions: The tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment. The well-known risks of smoking have led\nregulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.\n\nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's\n(“WHO”) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”), which entered into force in 2005. The FCTC has as its main\nobjective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use. To date, 181 countries and the\nEuropean Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and\nrecommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties (“CoP”), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and\npolicy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty. In October 2018, the CoP\nrecognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products. Similar to its\nprevious policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as\nappropriate under their national laws.\n\n32\n", "vlm_text": "\nWe are regularly examined by tax authorities around the world, and we are currently under examination in a number of jurisdictions.

These challenges, which are discussed below and in “ Cautionary Factors That May  Affect Future Results ,” include: \n• regulatory restrictions on our products, including restrictions on the packaging, marketing, and sale of tobacco or other  nicotine-containing products that could reduce our competitiveness, eliminate our ability to communicate with adult  consumers, or even ban certain of our products; • fiscal challenges, such as excessive excise tax increases and discriminatory tax structures; • illicit trade in cigarettes and other tobacco and nicotine-containing products, including counterfeit, contraband and so-called  “illicit whites”;  • intense competition, including from non-tax paid volume by certain local manufacturers; • pending and threatened litigation as discussed in Item 8, Note 17.  Contingencies ; and • governmental investigations. \nRegulatory Restrictions:  The tobacco industry operates in a highly regulated environment.  The well-known risks of smoking have led  regulators to impose significant restrictions and high excise taxes on cigarettes.   \nMuch of the regulation that shapes the business environment in which we operate is driven by the World Health Organization's  (“WHO”) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”), which entered into force in 2005. The FCTC has as its main  objective to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation, with the purpose of reducing tobacco use.  To date, 181 countries and the  European Union are Parties to the FCTC. The treaty requires Parties to have in place various tobacco control measures and  recommends others. The FCTC governing body, the Conference of the Parties (“CoP”), has also adopted non-binding guidelines and  policy recommendations related to certain articles of the FCTC that go beyond the text of the treaty.  In October 2018, the CoP  recognized the need for more scientific assessment and improved reporting to define policy on heated tobacco products.  Similar to its  previous policy recommendations on e-cigarettes, the CoP invited countries to regulate, restrict or prohibit heated tobacco products, as  appropriate under their national laws.  "}

We have conducted a series of clinical studies for\nthis platform, the results of which were included in our submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) described\nbelow. We completed a 6+6-month exposure response study and shared the results with the FDA in April 2020. The study showed\nthat for the group that switched to our Platform | product, the eight clinical risk endpoints that were tested as co-primary endpoints in\nthe first six-month term moved in the same direction as observed for smoking cessation after 12 months of use of this product. In\naddition, we completed an 18-month combined chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity study in mice, which was on-going at the time of\nour FDA submission. We shared the results with the FDA in August 2018.\n\nPlatform 2 uses a pressed carbon heat source which, when ignited, generates a nicotine-containing aerosol by heating\ntobacco. The results of our pharmacokinetic study (that measured the nicotine pharmacokinetic profile as well as subjective effects)\nand of our five-day reduced exposure study indicate that this platform could be an acceptable substitute for adult smokers who seek an\nalternative to cigarettes. The reduced exposure study results showed a substantial reduction in relevant biomarkers of exposure to the\nmeasured HPHCs in those who switched to Platform 2 compared to those who continued to smoke cigarettes over a five-day period.\nThe sustainability of this reduction as well as changes in clinical risk markers were assessed in a three-month reduced exposure study,\nwhich was completed in 2018.\n\nPlatform 3 provides an aerosol of nicotine salt. We have explored two routes for this platform, one with electronics and one\nwithout, and conducted nicotine pharmacokinetic studies with both versions. The results of our pharmacokinetic study related to the\nversion without electronics indicate this product's potential as an acceptable alternative to continued cigarette smoking in terms of\nproduct satisfaction. In February 2020, we completed a product use and adaptation study in adult smokers for the product variant\nwithout electronics.\n\nPlatform 4 covers e-vapor products, which are battery-powered devices that produce an aerosol by vaporizing a nicotine-\ncontaining liquid solution. In 2020, our e-vapor products comprised devices with the “coil and wick” technology as well as our e-\nvapor mesh technology designed to ensure the consistency and quality of the generated aerosol compared to the products with the “coil\nand wick” technology. Recently, we discontinued the commercialization of devices with the “coil and wick” technology. We\nconducted a nicotine pharmacokinetic study with respect to products with our e-vapor mesh technology in 2017. The results of this\nstudy indicate that these products are an effective means of nicotine delivery while being a satisfying alternative for e-cigarette users.\nIn March 2019, a six-month pre-clinical study in mice evaluating the impact of e-cigarette vapor on the risks of pulmonary and\ncardiovascular disease compared to cigarette smoke was completed; this study did not pertain to a specific product.

We conduct rigorous  scientific assessments of our RRP platforms to substantiate that they reduce exposure to HPHCs and, ultimately, that these products  present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to adult smokers who switch to them versus continued  smoking. We draw upon a team of expert scientists and engineers from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines and our extensive  learnings of adult consumer preferences to develop and assess our RRPs. Our efforts are guided by the following key objectives: \n• to develop RRPs that adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke find to be satisfying alternatives to smoking; • for those adult smokers, our goal is to offer RRPs with a scientifically substantiated risk-reduction profile that approaches as  closely as possible that associated with smoking cessation;  • to substantiate the reduction of risk for the individual adult smoker and the reduction of harm to the population as a whole,  based on scientific evidence of the highest standard that is made available for scrutiny and review by external independent  scientists and relevant regulatory bodies; and • to advocate for the development of science-based regulatory frameworks for the development and commercialization of  RRPs, including the communication of scientifically substantiated information to enable adult smokers to make better  consumer choices. \nOur RRP Platforms:  Our product development is based on the elimination of combustion via tobacco heating and other innovative  systems for aerosol generation, which we believe is the most promising path to providing a better consumer choice for those who  would otherwise continue to smoke.

To date, we have filed a comprehensive dossier summarizing our scientific assessment of our Platform 1 product in over 20  member states.   \nIn addition, in Italy, in April 2018, we submitted an application for  HEETS , used with the  IQOS  device, requesting regulatory  recognition of the reduction of toxic substances and potential risk reduction resulting from switching to this product compared to  continued cigarette smoking.  In January 2019, our application was not granted primarily on the grounds of insufficient data and  questions of methodology.  Due to the constraints of the review process, we had been unable to supplement the application with all the  data we subsequently filed with the FDA and to address methodological questions during the review. We plan to submit a new  application where we will clarify the concerns raised by the decision and further strengthen our application by submitting additional  evidence that became available since we submitted our first application, consistent with our FDA filings. We are confident that our  evidence supports our application. \nOn October 31, 2019, our Australian subsidiary, Philip Morris Limited (“PML”), submitted an application to the Scheduling  Committee of the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia (“TGA”) seeking to exempt heated tobacco products from being  prohibited in Australia. In August 2020, the TGA issued its decision denying the application and stating that it did not present  compelling evidence to establish a public health benefit from greater access to nicotine in heated tobacco products.  \nTo date, several governmental agencies have published their scientific findings that analyze the harm-reduction potential of certain  RRPs versus continuing smoking, including: \nIn December 2017, at the request of the U.K. Department of Health and Public Health England, the U.K. Committee on Toxicity  published its assessment of the risk of heat-not-burn products relative to cigarette smoking.  This assessment included analysis of  scientific data for two heat-not-burn products, one of which was our Platform 1 product.  The assessment concluded that, while still  harmful to health, compared with the known risks from cigarettes, heat-not-burn products are probably less harmful. Subsequently, in  February 2018, Public Health England published a report stating that the available evidence suggests that heat-not-burn products may  be considerably less harmful than cigarettes and more harmful than e-cigarettes.

For further details, see Item 8, Note 19. Asset Impairment and Exit Costs for additional\ninformation.\n\nHigher net earnings in 2020, excluding the impact of the above 2019 non-cash charges, were partly attributable to the Russia excise\nand VAT audit charge of $374 million which was paid in the third quarter of 2019.

This decrease in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the reduction of cash in 2019\nresulting from the deconsolidation of RBH and lower capital expenditures, partially offset by higher cash collateral posted to secure\nderivatives designated as net investment hedges of Euro assets principally related to changes in exchange rates between the Euro and\nthe U.S. dollar.

PMI recognizes the funded status of its defined pension and postretirement plans on the consolidated balance\nsheets.

For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the\nprojected benefit obligation. For the postretirement health care plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit\nobligation.

The guidance also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable\ninputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The guidance describes three levels of input that may\nbe used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs\ninclude quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

PMI utilizes certain financial instruments to manage foreign currency and interest rate exposure. Derivative financial\ninstruments are used by PMI principally to reduce exposures to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange\nand interest rates by creating offsetting exposures. PMI is not a party to leveraged derivatives and, by policy, does not use derivative\nfinancial instruments for speculative purposes. Substantially all of PMI's derivative financial instruments are subject to master netting\narrangements, whereby the right to offset occurs in the event of default by a participating party. While these contracts contain the\nenforceable right to offset through close-out netting rights, PMI elects to present them on a gross basis in the consolidated balance\nsheets. Collateral associated with these arrangements is in the form of cash and is unrestricted. Financial instruments qualifying for\nhedge accounting must maintain a specified level of effectiveness between the hedging instrument and the item being hedged, both at\ninception and throughout the hedged period. PMI formally documents the nature and relationships between the hedging instruments\nand hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives, strategies for undertaking the various hedge transactions and method of\nassessing hedge effectiveness. Additionally, for hedges of forecasted transactions, the significant characteristics and expected terms of\nthe forecasted transaction must be specifically identified, and it must be probable that each forecasted transaction will occur. If it were\ndeemed probable that the forecasted transaction would not occur, the gain or loss would be recognized in earnings.\n\nPMI uses deliverable and non-deliverable forward foreign exchange contracts, foreign currency swaps and foreign currency options,\ncollectively referred to as foreign exchange contracts (\"foreign exchange contracts\"), and interest rate contracts to mitigate its\nexposure to changes in exchange and interest rates from third-party and intercompany actual and forecasted transactions. Both foreign\nexchange contracts and interest rate contracts are collectively referred to as derivative contracts (\"derivative contracts\"). The primary\ncurrencies to which PMI is exposed include the Euro, Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, Russian ruble\nand Swiss franc.

Imperial Tobacco\nLtd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada, filed in November 1998, RBH\nand other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants. The plaintiffs, an anti-\nsmoking organization and an individual smoker, sought compensatory and punitive damages for each member of the class who\nallegedly suffers from certain smoking-related diseases. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court issued its judgment on May 27,\n2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and found that the class members’ compensatory\ndamages totaled approximately CAD 15.5 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $12.1 billion). The trial court\nawarded compensatory damages on a joint and several liability basis, allocating 20% to our subsidiary (approximately CAD 3.1\nbillion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.4 billion)). In addition, the trial court awarded CAD 90,000 (approximately\n$70,250) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 30,000 (approximately $23,400) to RBH. The trial court estimated the disease class at\n99,957 members. RBH appealed to the Court of Appeal of Quebec. In October 2015, the Court of Appeal ordered RBH to furnish\nsecurity totaling CAD 226 million (approximately $176.4 million) to cover both the Létourneau and Blais cases, which RBH has paid\nin installments through March 2017. The Court of Appeal ordered Imperial Tobacco Canada Ltd. to furnish security totaling CAD\n758 million (approximately $592 million) in installments through June 2017. JTI Macdonald Corp. was not required to furnish\nsecurity in accordance with plaintiffs’ motion. The Court of Appeal ordered that the security is payable upon a final judgment of the\nCourt of Appeal affirming the trial court’s judgment or upon further order of the Court of Appeal. On March 1, 2019, the Court of\nAppeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the compensatory and punitive damages award\nwhile reducing the total amount of compensatory damages to approximately CAD 13.5 billion including interest (approximately $10.5\nbillion) due to the trial court’s error in the calculation of interest. The compensatory damages award is on a joint and several basis with\nan allocation of 20% to RBH (approximately CAD 2.7 billion, including pre-judgment interest (approximately $2.11 billion)). The\nCourt of Appeal upheld the trial court’s findings that defendants violated the Civil Code of Quebec, the Quebec Charter of Human\nRights and Freedoms, and the Quebec Consumer Protection Act by failing to warn adequately of the dangers of smoking and by\nconspiring to prevent consumers from learning of the dangers of smoking. The Court of Appeal further held that the plaintiffs either\nneed not prove, or had adequately proven, that these faults were a cause of the class members’ injuries. In accordance with the\njudgment, defendants are required to deposit their respective portions of the damages awarded in both the Létourneau case described\nbelow and the Blais case, approximately CAD 1.1 billion (approximately $859 million), into trust accounts within 60 days. RBH’s\nshare of the deposit is approximately CAD 257 million (approximately $194 million). PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $194 million\nin its consolidated results, representing $142 million net of tax, as tobacco litigation-related expense, in the first quarter of 2019. The\ncharge reflects PMI’s assessment of the portion of the judgment that represents probable and estimable loss prior to the\ndeconsolidation of RBH and corresponds to the trust account deposit required by the judgment.\n\nIn the second class action pending in Canada, Cecilia Létourneau v.

The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and\npunitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court\nissued its judgment on May 27, 2015. The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of\nCAD 131 million (approximately $102.3 million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 46 million (approximately $36 million) to\nRBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at 918,000 members but declined to award compensatory damages to the\naddiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy. The trial court found that a claims process\nto allocate the awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer. On March\n1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the total amount of punitive\ndamages awarded allocating CAD 57 million including interest (approximately $44.5 million) to RBH. See the Blais description\nabove and Note 20. Deconsolidation of RBH below for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both Létourneau and\nBlais cases and the impact of the decision on PMI’s financial statements.\n\nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both Létourneau and the Blais cases were incorrect and in contravention\nof applicable law on several grounds including the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or\nshould have known, of the risks of smoking; (ii) defendants cannot be liable to class members who would have smoked regardless of\nwhat warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences between class\nmembers.\n\nIn the third class action pending in Canada, Kunta v.

Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. and  JTI-Macdonald Corp., Quebec Superior Court, Canada,  filed in September 1998, RBH and other Canadian manufacturers (Imperial  Tobacco Canada Ltd. and JTI-Macdonald Corp.) are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, sought compensatory and  punitive damages for each member of the class who is deemed addicted to smoking. The class was certified in 2005. The trial court  issued its judgment on May 27, 2015.  The trial court found RBH and two other Canadian manufacturers liable and awarded a total of  CAD 131 million (approximately   $\\S102.3$   million) in punitive damages, allocating CAD 46 million (approximately   $\\S36$   million) to  RBH. The trial court estimated the size of the addiction class at 918,000 members but declined to award compensatory damages to the  addiction class because the evidence did not establish the claims with sufficient accuracy.  The trial court found that a claims process  to allocate the awarded punitive damages to individual class members would be too expensive and difficult to administer.  On March  1, 2019, the Court of Appeal issued a decision largely affirming the trial court’s findings of liability and the total amount of punitive  damages awarded allocating CAD 57 million including interest (approximately   $\\S44.5$   million) to RBH.  See the  Blais  description  above and Note 20.  Deconsolidation of RBH  below for further detail concerning the security order pertaining to both  Létourneau  and  Blais  cases and the impact of the decision on PMI’s financial statements. \nRBH and PMI believe the findings of liability and damages in both  Létourneau  and the  Blais  cases were incorrect and in contravention  of applicable law on several grounds including the following: (i) defendants had no obligation to warn class members who knew, or  should have known, of the risks of smoking; (ii) defendants cannot be liable to class members who would have smoked regardless of  what warnings were given; and (iii) defendants cannot be liable to all class members given the individual differences between class  members.  \nIn the third class action pending in Canada,  Kunta v. Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, et al., The Queen's Bench, Winnipeg,  Canada , filed June 12, 2009, we, RBH, and our indemnitees (PM USA and Altria), and other members of the industry are defendants.  The plaintiff, an individual smoker, alleges her own addiction to tobacco products and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (“COPD”), severe asthma, and mild reversible lung disease resulting from the use of tobacco products. She is seeking compensatory  and punitive damages on behalf of a proposed class comprised of all smokers, their estates, dependents and family members, as well as  restitution of profits, and reimbursement of government health care costs allegedly caused by tobacco products.

The claim  asks the court to order the government to enact stricter regulations on the manufacture and sale of tobacco products. In addition, the  plaintiffs ask the court to order companies involved in the tobacco industry to allocate a percentage of their “sales or benefits” to  establish a fund to pay for the health care costs of treating smoking-related diseases. In October 2008, the court ruled that plaintiffs  have standing to file the claim and that the claim meets the threshold admissibility requirements. In December 2012, the court  admitted our subsidiary and BAT's subsidiary as interested third parties. In February 2013, our subsidiary answered the complaint. \nReduced-Risk Products \nIn Colombia, an individual filed a purported class action,  Ana Ferrero Rebolledo v. Philip Morris Colombia S.A., et al. , in April 2019  against our subsidiaries with the Civil Court of Bogota related to the marketing of our Platform 1 product. Plaintiff alleged  that our  subsidiaries advertise the product in contravention of law and in a manner that misleads consumers by portraying the product in a  positive light, and further asserts that the Platform 1 vapor contains many toxic compounds, creates a high level of dependence, and  has damaging second-hand effects.   Plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages on her behalf and on a behalf of two classes (class 1  - all Platform 1 consumers in Colombia who seek damages for the purchase price of the product and personal injuries related to the  alleged addiction, and class 2 - all residents of the neighborhood where the advertising allegedly took place who seek damages for  exposure to the alleged illegal advertising).  Our subsidiaries answered the complaint in January 2020, and in February 2020, plaintiff  filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint modifies the relief sought on behalf of the named plaintiff and on behalf of a  single class (all consumers of Platform 1 products in Colombia who seek damages for the product purchase price and personal injuries  related to the use of an allegedly harmful product).  \nOther Litigation \nThe Department of Special Investigations of the government of Thailand (\"DSI\") conducted an investigation into alleged  underpayment by our subsidiary, Philip Morris (Thailand) Limited (\"PM Thailand\"), of customs duties and excise taxes relating to  imports from the Philippines covering the period 2003-2007.  On January 18, 2016, the Public Prosecutor filed charges against our  subsidiary and seven former and current employees   in the   Bangkok Criminal Court alleging that PM Thailand and the individual  defendants jointly and with the intention to defraud the Thai government, under-declared import prices of cigarettes to avoid full  payment of taxes and duties in connection with import entries of cigarettes from the Philippines during the period of July 2003 to June  2006. The government is seeking a fine of approximately THB 80.8 billion (approximately   $\\S2.7$   billion).  In May 2017, Thailand  enacted a new customs act. The new act, which took effect in November 2017, substantially limits the amount of fines that Thailand  could seek in these proceedings.  PM Thailand believes that its declared import prices are in compliance with the Customs Valuation  Agreement of the World Trade Organization and Thai law and that the allegations of the Public Prosecutor are inconsistent with  several decisions already taken by Thai Customs and other Thai governmental agencies.  Trial in the case began in November 2017  and concluded in September 2019.  In November 2019, the trial court found our subsidiary guilty of under-declaration of the prices  and imposed a fine of approximately THB 1.2 billion (approximately   $\\S39.9$   million).  The trial court dismissed all charges against the  individual defendants. In December 2019, as required by the Thai law, our subsidiary paid the fine.  This payment is included in other  assets on the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated  statements of cash flows in the period of payment.  Our subsidiary filed an appeal of the trial court's decision. In addition, the Public  Prosecutor filed an appeal of the trial court's decision challenging the dismissal of charges against the individual defendants and the  amount of the fine imposed. If our subsidiary ultimately prevails on appeal, then Thailand will be required to return this payment to  our subsidiary.   "}

(\"PM Korea\"), our South Korean subsidiary, were in compliance with South Korean tax laws. In\nNovember 2016, the tax authorities completed their audit and assessed allegedly underpaid taxes and penalties. In order to avoid\nnonpayment financial costs, PM Korea paid approximately KRW 272 billion (approximately $243 million), of which KRW 100\nbillion (approximately $89.3 million) was paid in 2016 and KRW 172 billion (approximately $153.7 million) was paid in the first\nquarter of 2017. These paid amounts are included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and negatively impacted net cash\nprovided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the period of payment. PM Korea appealed the\nassessments. In January 2020, a trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay taxes in the amount of approximately KRW 218\nbillion (approximately $195 million). The tax authorities appealed this decision to the appellate court. In September 2020, the\nappellate court upheld the trial court's decision. The tax authorities have appealed to the Supreme Court of South Korea. In June 2020,\nanother trial court ruled that PM Korea did not underpay approximately KRW 54 billion (approximately $48 million) of alleged\nunderpayments. The government agencies appealed this decision. In January 2021, the appellate court upheld the trial court's decision.\nThe government agencies may appeal. If the tax authorities and government agencies ultimately lose, then they would be required to\nreturn the paid amounts to PM Korea.\n\nThe Moscow Tax Inspectorate for Major Taxpayers (“MTI”’) conducted an audit of AO Philip Morris Izhora (“PM Izhora’’), our\nRussian subsidiary, for the 2015-2017 financial years. On July 26, 2019, MTI issued its initial assessment, claiming that intercompany\nsales of cigarettes between PM Izhora and another Russian subsidiary prior to excise tax increases and submission by PM Izhora of the\nmaximum retail sales price notifications for cigarettes to the tax authorities were improper under Russian tax laws and resulted in\nunderpayment of excise taxes and VAT. In August 2019, PM Izhora submitted its objections disagreeing with MTI’s allegations set\nforth in the initial assessment and MTI’s methodology for calculating the alleged underpayments. MTI accepted some of PM Izhora’s\narguments and in September 2019, issued the final tax assessment claiming an underpayment of RUB 24.3 billion (approximately\n$374 million), including penalties and interest. In accordance with Russian tax laws, PM Izhora paid the entire amount of MTI’s final\nassessment. This amount was neither imposed on, nor concurrent with, the specific revenue-producing transaction, nor was it\ncollected from customers of our Russian subsidiaries. In the third quarter of 2019, PMI recorded a pre-tax charge of $374 million, in\nmarketing, administration and research costs in the consolidated statements of earnings, representing $315 million net of an associated\nincome tax benefit of $59 million.\n\nThe Saudi Arabia Customs General Authority issued its assessments requiring our distributors (one former and one current) to pay\nadditional customs duties in an amount of approximately 1.5 billion Saudi Riyal, or approximately $396 million, in relation to the fees\npaid by these distributors under their agreements with our subsidiary for exclusive rights to distribute our products in Saudi Arabia\nduring the period of 2014 through 2018.
