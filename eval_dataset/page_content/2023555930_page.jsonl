Blood Money (Diya) \nHistorically, Iranian law, influenced by interpretations from Islamic jurists, has exhibited  significant religious and gender-based discrimination, including in the context of blood money  ( diya ), where the law established clear and implied distinctions among Muslims; constitutionally  recognized non-Muslims; unrecognized non-Muslims; and men, women, and transgender  individuals. Before 2003, constitutionally recognized non-Muslims were openly awarded lower  diya  amounts than Muslims in accordance with the implied language of the law and Islamic  interpretations of it, though the exact fraction of this difference varied due to diverse  interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence. In 2003, an amendment was introduced to the then- existing article 297 of the penal code, explicitly providing for equality between constitutionally  recognized non-Muslims and Muslims with regard to  diya .
