The task was to develop a classiﬁer that could discriminate between  Overtly Aggressive ,  Covertly Aggressive , and  Non-aggressive  texts. For this task, the participants were provided with a dataset of 15,000 aggression-annotated Facebook Posts and Comments each in Hindi (in both Roman and Devanagari script) and English for training and validation. For testing, two different sets - one from Facebook and another from a different social media - were provided. A total of 130 teams registered to participate in the task, 30 teams submitted their test runs, and ﬁnally 20 teams also sent their system description paper which are included in the TRAC workshop proceedings. The best system obtained a weighted F-score of 0.64 for both Hindi and English on the Facebook test sets, while the best scores on the surprise set were 0.60 and 0.50 for English and Hindi respectively. The results presented in this report depict how challenging the task is. The positive response from the community and the great levels of participation in the ﬁrst edition of this shared task also highlights the interest in this topic.

This has resulted in not only positive exchange of ideas but has also lead to a widespread dissemination of aggressive and potentially harmful content over the web. While most of the potentially harmful incidents like bullying or hate speech have predated the Internet, the reach and extent of Internet has given these incidents an unprecedented power and inﬂuence to affect the lives of billions of people. It has been reported that these incidents have not only created mental and psychological agony to the users of the web but has in fact forced people to deactivate their accounts and in extreme cases also commit suicides (Hinduja and Patchin, 2010). Thus the incidents of aggression and unratiﬁed verbal behaviour have not remained a minor nuisance, but have acquired the form of a major criminal activity that affects a large number of people.

Moreover, it has also resulted in duplication of research, to certain extent, and a certain kind of lack of focus and reusability of datasets across different strands of research. In order to make improvements towards solving a complex phenomenon like this, it is of utmost importance that some kind of uniform understanding of problem be achieved so that, at least, standardised datasets and an understanding of different approaches to solving the problem may be developed.

All of these behaviours are considered undesirable, aggressive and detrimental for those on the receiving end. So, trolling is intended “to cause disruption and/or to trigger or exacerbate conﬂict for the purposes of their own amusement” (Hardaker, 2010). Cyberbullying is “humiliating and slandering behavior towards other people” (Nitta et al., 2013).

(2017) makes an attempt to unify these different trends of research in what may be con- sidered a signiﬁcantly overlapping ﬁeld and proposes a 2-way typology for understanding what they call\n\n ’abusive language’ over the web. They propose 2 scales on which abusive language could be categorised\n\n - the target of the abuse (an individual or a group) and the nature of the language (explicit or implicit). Our classiﬁcation of aggression into overt and covert aggression is largely similar to the explicit-implicit distinction. However, we make a more detailed distinction in relation to the target of the abuse (Kumar et al., 2018b) and it is not made along the axis of individual vs. group. This is so because we noticed in a large number of instances both individuals and groups are simultaneously targeted - in such cases individuals are targeted as members of certain groups or the individuals’ actions were considered those of the group and became the locus of attack. As such it was not feasible to distinguish between the individual and group attack in lot of instances while annotating the dataset. The distinction that we made was related to the “locus” of attack and included such targets as gender, religion, caste, country of origin, race, etc. This classiﬁcation, on the one hand, gave scope for focusing on different kinds of attack (for example, racial attacks or communal attacks) and, on the other hand, each of these targets may actually be attacked using a different set of vocabulary, thereby, making these more natural classes that could be classiﬁed using the surface-level linguistic features. Of course, it cannot be denied that these targets are not mutually exclusive and, as such, it makes the problem not just a multi-class classiﬁcation problem but also multi-label classiﬁcation problem. In addition to this, we also make use of a different terminol- ogy taking into account its use within socio-pragmatics. This was done with an understanding that huge amount of literature within the ﬁeld of aggression and impoliteness studies might be able to contribute and provide insights to understanding the phenomenon in a better way.
