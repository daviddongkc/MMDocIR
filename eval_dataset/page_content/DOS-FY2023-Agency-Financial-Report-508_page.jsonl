We established new bureaus and  offices to lead and elevate U.S. diplomacy on  cyberspace, emerging technology, and global  health security, and stood up an integrated  Office of China Coordination to lead on the  global, economic, and technological dimensions  of the PRC challenge. We have accelerated  hiring and secured new resources to allow our  employees to invest time in training without  impeding readiness, while implementing a new  learning policy to offer employees more ways  to enhance their professional development. To  ensure the Department continues to attract and  retain world-class talent, we’ve shortened hiring  timelines, established a retention unit, expanded  opportunities for Civil Service employees to  serve overseas, and launched a paid internship  program to expand pathways for students from all  backgrounds to pursue career opportunities with  the Department. \nAs the scale and scope of the challenges we face  are intensifying, our work is far from finished.  Yet, the United States is in a stronger geopolitical  position today thanks to the work we are  doing to renew our alliances and partnerships  and reimagine them for a new era of strategic  competition and global change. \nAnd the Department of State is stronger for the  investments we are making in our greatest asset,  our workforce. These investments are essential to  fulfill our responsibility of ensuring our diplomacy  and foreign policy deliver for the American  people.

Department of State \nThis AFR is our principal report to the President,  Congress, and the American people on the  Department’s management of the public  funds entrusted to us to achieve our goals  and objectives, enabling our leadership of  U.S. diplomacy. The Department maintains a  comprehensive, sound system of management  controls to ensure this AFR is complete and  reliable. The Department conducted its  assessment of the effectiveness of internal  controls over reporting in accordance with  Appendix A of OMB Circular A-123. Based  on the results of this assessment and the  results of the independent audit, I can provide  reasonable assurance that the FY 2023 financial  statements are complete and reliable. \nMoreover, the reports on performance and  additional financial information in the AFR should  strengthen public confidence in the Department’s  management. The Message from the Comptroller  in this AFR highlights progress made to improve  financial management this past year and includes  the results of the independent audit of our  FY 2023 financial statements.  \nThis image appears to show a signature that reads \"Antony Blinken.\"\nAntony J.

Guided by the policy, the Department  supports the analysis and use of evidence  in policymaking by training staff, creating  groups for knowledge sharing, establishing  and monitoring evaluation requirements, and  maintaining a central database to manage  and share evaluations. The Department  continues efforts to strengthen the use of  data and evidence to drive better decision  making, achieve greater impacts, and more  effectively and efficiently achieve U.S. foreign  policy objectives.  \nOne of the efforts includes an annual internal  review of the Department’s strategies and  resources. These strategic discussions allow  Department leadership to monitor progress  against strategic priorities, consider emerging  challenges, and inform resource decisions.  \nOther examples of ongoing efforts to bolster the  Department’s ability to plan, execute, monitor,  and evaluate programs and projects in a way that  encourages learning and adapting are outlined  in Figure 12. \nThe table is titled \"Figure 12. Program Design, Monitoring, and Evaluation Policy\" and is divided into three columns:\n\n1. **Tools**\n   - Program Design and Performance Management Toolkit\n   - Evaluation Toolkit\n\n2. **Skill Building**\n   - Courses on strategic planning and performance management\n   - Courses on managing evaluations and evaluation design\n   - Developing State’s capacity to perform strategic evaluations of cross-cutting key priorities\n\n3. **Peer Learning**\n   - Program Design and Performance Management Community of Practice\n   - Evaluation Community of Practice\nBuilding a Learning and Data-Centric  Culture: Evidence Act Implementation  \nWith passage of the Foundations for  Evidence-Based Policymaking Act  (“Evidence Act”; Public Law No. 115- 435)  in 2018, the Department engaged with  leadership, performance, and evaluation  professionals across the Department and  external stakeholders to implement this  groundbreaking legislation to advance  evidence-building in the Federal Government  by improving access to data and expanding  research and evaluation capacity. As required  of CFO Act agencies, and in support of Title 1  of the “Evidence Act,” the  Department’s FY  2022-2026 Learning Agenda  contains a set of  policy-relevant questions critical to achieving  the agency’s foreign policy objectives. In 2023,  the Department created the State Evidence and  Learning Partnership to structure collaborative  research via private/public partnerships  to address these important questions.  "}

Many, including  art, historic American furnishings, rare books  and cultural objects, are not reflected as assets  on the Department’s Balance Sheets 2 . Federal  accounting standards attempt to match costs  to accomplishments in operating performance  and have deemed that the allocation of  historical cost through depreciation of a national  treasure or other priceless item intended to  \nbe preserved forever as part of our American  heritage would not contribute to performance  cost measurement. Thus, the acquisition cost  of heritage assets is expensed, not capitalized.  The maintenance costs of these heritage assets  are expensed as incurred, since it is part of the  Government’s role to maintain them in good  condition. All embassies and other properties  on the Secretary of State’s Register of Culturally  Significant Property, however, do appear as  assets on the Balance Sheets, since they are used  in the day-to-day operations of the Department. \nLiabilities . The Department’s total liabilities  were  $\\S43.6$   billion as of September 30, 2023,  an increase of  $\\mathsf{S}2.8$   billion (7 percent) between  2022 and 2023. Federal Employee and Veteran  Benefits Liability increased  $\\S2.0$   billion  (6 percent) from 2022, accounting for most of  this increase. This increase from the prior year  related to higher actuarial liabilities for the  pension and retirement plans administered by  the Department, which reviews and adjusts this  liability annually.  \nFigure 15 summarizes the total liabilities as  of September 30, 2023.

Since then,  Russia has continued to willingly and knowingly  inflict incalculable damage on the Ukrainian  people, Ukrainian sovereignty, and the rest  of the world – violating international law,  human rights, and core principles of the United  Nations Charter. Ukraine has defended itself  courageously, with robust support from the  United States and other partners. \nIn 2023, Russia continued to commit atrocities  against the people of Ukraine. Occupation  forces have routinely kidnapped and refused to  return tens of thousands of Ukrainian children.  These children are instead sent to “re-education  facilities” across Russia. Additionally, thousands  of innocent civilians have been killed by missile  and drone strikes, while Russia’s forces have  intentionally targeted civilian infrastructure in  energy and other sectors. In July, Russia formally  ended its participation in the Black Sea Grain  Initiative that previously facilitated agricultural  exports from Ukraine by sea, driving up food  prices and causing hunger worldwide. \nHowever, U.S. assistance has delivered powerful  results. Ukraine has not only withstood these  challenges, but it has also retaken over half of  the territory seized by Russia in early 2022. Now,  Ukrainian forces are conducting a broad-based  counter offensive and striking Russian command  and control and military supply lines deep in  Russian-occupied territory. \nAs of September 30, 2023, the U.S. Embassy in  Kyiv was still actively providing services and has  not sustained any damage from Russia’s war of  aggression against Ukraine that would trigger an  impairment of Federal assets or real property.  The United States will continue to provide vital  economic, humanitarian, and security assistance  so Ukraine can defend itself and protect  its people. \nSuspension of Operations in Sudan \nThe U.S. Embassy in Khartoum, Sudan,  was evacuated and on-site operations were  suspended in April 2023, except for the  continued physical monitoring and protection  of the Embassy compound and facilities. As  heavy fighting between the Sudanese Armed  Forces and Rapid Support Forces inflicts untold  harm on civilians, the Department will use every  diplomatic, economic, political, and development  assistance tool at our disposal to advance the  five U.S. principles of 1) ending the fighting, 2)  ensuring humanitarian access, 3) returning to a  credible and inclusive political process, 4) having  a Sudanese-led process, and 5) acknowledging  there is no military solution to the conflict.  \nThe Department must continue to lead  engagement with Sudanese civilian  groups from around the country, including  representatives of political parties and  initiatives, civil society, professional and labor  unions, Resistance Committees, and women  and youth organizations, to foster an inclusive  and broadly representative civilian coalition  that can determine priorities for a transitional  government and select its leadership.

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion\non the effectiveness of the Department’s internal control. We limited our internal control\ntesting to those controls necessary to achieve the objectives described in OMB Bulletin No. 24-\n01. We did not test all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly defined by\nthe Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982,1 such as those controls relevant to\nensuring efficient operations.\n\nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow\nmanagement or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to\nprevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.

Accordingly, we do not express an opinion  on the effectiveness of the Department’s   internal control. We limited our internal control  testing to those controls necessary to achieve the objectives described in OMB Bulletin No. 24- 01. We did not test all internal controls relevant to operating objectives as broadly defined by  the Federal Managers’ Financial Integrity Act of 1982,  such as those controls relevant to  ensuring efficient operations.  \nA deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow  management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to  prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements on a timely basis.

We also found instances in which the Department did not transfer amounts\nrecorded as prepayments for real property acquisitions (e.g., deposits or option fees) to\na property account in a timely manner. Additionally, we identified one instance in which\nthe Department did not accurately record prepayments made related to a planned real\nproperty acquisition. Although the Department implemented certain controls, such as a\nquarterly data call, to identify real property acquisitions and disposals, the controls did\nnot ensure that all real property transactions were recorded in the proper fiscal year or\nthat prepayments were identified and recorded as required.

We also identified instances in which\ncompleted projects were not transferred from SID to the internal use software account\nin a timely manner. Additionally, we identified a software initiative that should have\nbeen identified as an SID project; however, the Department inaccurately recorded costs\nrelated to this project as operating expenses. One reason this occurred was that the\nDepartment’s quarterly data call process relied on the responsiveness and\nunderstanding of individual project managers, not all of whom understood the\naccounting requirements for reporting SID. Additionally, the Department did not have\nan effective process to confirm that information provided by project managers was\ncomplete, accurate, or supported.

Title 22,  Foreign Relations and Intercourse, Section 3968,  Local Compensation Plans, provides the authority  to the Department to establish such benefits as  part of a total compensation plan for  these employees.  \nDefined Benefit Plans:  The Department has  implemented various arrangements for defined  benefit pension plans in other countries, for the  benefit of some FSN employees. Some of these  plans supplement the host country’s equivalent  to U.S. social security, others do not. While none  of these supplemental plans are mandated by the  host country, some are substitutes for optional  tiers of a host country’s social security system.  The Department accounts for these plans under  the provisions and guidance contained in  International Accounting Standards (IAS) No. 19,  Employee Benefits . IAS No. 19 provides a better  structure for the reporting of these plans which  are established in accordance with local practices  in countries overseas. \nLump Sum Retirement and Severance:  Under  some local compensation plans, FSN employees  are entitled to receive a lump-sum separation  payment when they resign, retire, or otherwise  separate through no fault of their own. The  amount of the payment is generally based on  length of service, rate of pay at the time of  separation, and the type of separation. \nS. International Organizations Liability \nThe United States is a member of the  United Nations (UN) and other international  organizations and supports UN peacekeeping  operations. As such, the United States either  contributes to voluntary funds or an assessed  share of the budgets and expenses of these  organizations and activities. These payments are  funded through congressional appropriations  to the Department. The purpose of these  appropriations is to ensure continued American  leadership within those organizations and  activities that serve important U.S. interests.  Funding by appropriations for dues assessed  for certain international organizations is  not received until the fiscal year following  assessment. These commitments are regarded  as funded only when monies are authorized and  appropriated by Congress. For financial reporting  purposes, the amounts assessed, pledged,  and unpaid are reported as liabilities of the  Department. Additional information is disclosed  in Note 10,  International Organizations Liability. \n\nT. Contingent Liabilities \nContingent liabilities are liabilities where the  existence or amount of the liability cannot  be determined with certainty pending the  outcome of future events. The Department  recognizes contingent liabilities when the  liability is probable and reasonably estimable.  See Note 8,  Other Liabilities , and Note 12,  Contingencies and Commitments . \nU. Funds from Dedicated Collections \nFunds from Dedicated Collections are financed  by specifically identified revenues, often  supplemented by other financing sources, which  remain available over time. These specifically  identified revenues and other financing sources  are required by statute to be used for designated  activities or purposes and must be accounted  for separately from the Government’s general  revenues. Additional information is disclosed in  Note 4,  Investments, Net,  and Note 13,  Funds  from Dedicated Collections . \nV. Net Position \nThe Department’s net position contains the  following components: \nUnexpended Appropriations:  Unexpended  appropriations is the sum of undelivered orders  and unobligated balances. Undelivered orders  represent the amount of obligations incurred for  goods or services ordered, but not yet received.  An unobligated balance is the amount available  after deducting cumulative obligations from  total budgetary resources. As obligations for  goods or services are incurred, the available  balance is reduced. "}

If the Plan terminates, different actuarial  assumptions and other factors might be  applicable for determining the actuarial present  value of accumulated plan benefits. The  assumption changes arise in connection with  the annual valuation and follow the guidelines  of SFFAS No. 33. The following table presents  the calculation of the combined FSRDS and FSPS  Pension Actuarial Liability and the assumptions  used in computing it for the years ended  September 30, 2023 and 2022  (dollars in millions) . \nThe table provides a financial snapshot as of September 30 for the years 2023 and 2022. It lists different financial items including:\n\n- **Fund Balance with Treasury**: There is no balance listed for both 2023 and 2022.\n- **Accounts and Interest Receivable**: $173 for 2023 and $150 for 2022.\n- **Investments in U.S. Government Securities**: $21,055 for 2023 and $20,681 for 2022.\n- **Total Assets**: $21,228 for 2023 and $20,831 for 2022.\n- **Less: Liabilities Other Than Actuarial**: $99 for 2023 and $91 for 2022.\n\nThe final line provides the **Net Assets Available for Benefits**: $21,129 for 2023 and $20,740 for 2022.

A liability is recognized  for those environmental costs that are both  probable and reasonably estimable (see Note 8,  Other Liabilities , for additional information). \nThe following table shows each type of  contingency, the likelihood of future events  occurring, and the estimated range of  loss as of September 30, 2023, and 2022  (dollars in millions) . \nThis table provides a breakdown of the accrued liabilities and estimated range of loss for legal and environmental contingencies for the years 2023 and 2022.\n\n- **Legal Contingencies:**\n  - **Probable (2023):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: $222\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $222 (Lower End) to $227 (Upper End)\n  - **Probable (2022):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: $66\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $66 (Lower End) to $223 (Upper End)\n  - **Reasonably Possible (2023):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: None\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $15 (Lower End) to $130 (Upper End)\n  - **Reasonably Possible (2022):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: None\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $20 (Lower End) to $134 (Upper End)\n\n- **Environmental Contingencies:**\n  - **Probable (2023):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: $52\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $52 (Lower End) to $52 (Upper End)\n  - **Probable (2022):**\n    - Accrued Liabilities: $52\n    - Estimated Range of Loss: $52 (Lower End) to $52 (Upper End)\n  - **Reasonably Possible (2023 & 2022):**\n    - No accrued liabilities or estimated range of loss is listed.\n\nThe table compares the financial impact of these contingencies over the two years, highlighting changes in the estimated loss amounts and accrued liabilities.\nCommitments \nIn addition to the future lease commitments  discussed in Note 11,  Leases , the Department  is committed under obligations for goods and  services which have been ordered but not yet  received at fiscal year-end; these are termed  undelivered orders (see Note 15,  Combined  Statements of Budgetary Resources ). \nRewards Programs  \nUnder 22 U.S.C. 2708, the Department has  the authority to operate rewards programs to  assist in the prevention of acts of international  terrorism, narcotics trafficking, war crimes, and  transnational organized crime.

The DBR provides a baseline against which the  Department can measure future DEIA progress  and allows the Department to identify potential  barriers to equal employment opportunity  and areas for further analysis and research to  develop strategies to mitigate them. \n\nThis noted step towards transparency – and by  extension greater accountability – is the first  time such a detailed view of a Federal agency’s  workforce has been publicly released.  Information is accessed via an interactive  dashboard, and a comprehensive alternative  version of the dashboard is available to ensure  those with disabilities have access to the  information. The data in the dashboard is  anonymous to ensure employees’ privacy. \nThe DBR data shows that while parts of our  workforce are diverse, there is progress still to  be made. By transparently sharing the workforce  data with employees, Congress, and the public,  the Department demonstrates its commitment  to holding itself accountable for creating an  environment where all employees have equal  opportunity to reach their full potential and  make their maximum contribution to protecting  and promoting U.S. national security interests.

Climate is the focus of  Objective 1.2 of the FY 2022-2026 State-USAID  Joint Strategic Plan (JSP), to which bureaus and  missions align their annual resource requests  and link their own strategic objectives. Climate  risk assessment and mitigation also supports  Objective 4.3 of the JSP, “Protect our personnel,  information, and physical infrastructure from  21st Century threats.” Many bureaus – including  OBO, the Bureau for Western Hemisphere  Affairs, and the Bureau of Population, Refugees,  and Migration – address climate in their bureau  strategic goals and/or objectives based on higher  level guidance from the JSP and White House. In  2022, the Department released a new risk policy  and is updating its global presence strategy,  and climate is included in each. Additionally,  as a part of the Secretary’s Modernization  Agenda, the Department is creating a risk  register and process to provide leaders with an  understanding of the Department’s risk exposure  and identify top “enterprise-level risks” – to  include climate risks – and mitigation.  \nThe transition to a lower-carbon economy has  many benefits for Department operations.  An example is that diesel generators are used  as a back-up energy source for residences  and facilities overseas. These generators are  noisy, costly to run, contribute to air pollution,  and require fuel supply. Deploying battery  and solar arrays can reduce the use of diesel  generators, while at the same time reducing  reputational risk from the Department  running lights during a blackout, improving air  quality, reducing or containing fuel costs, and  showcasing climate solutions. This transition  also requires significant capital investment at  the outset. The Department is evaluating the  use of Energy Savings Performance Contracts  and Power Purchase Agreements to make these  initiatives more systematic. At the same time,  the Department’s expansive global presence  means there may not be local suppliers or  mechanics, resulting in increased installation  and maintenance costs and risks. Additionally,  in some markets this transition may precipitate  lower and/or more consistent and predictable  energy costs, while in some markets it may  increase the cost of energy. Limited dedicated  funding and staff for climate and sustainability  means the Department will be slow to take  advantage of these opportunities, despite where  a clear return on investment exists, or may pay  more to deploy these technologies due to a lack  of in-house capability. \n\nThe Department uses the Climate Resilience  sub-working group of the Climate and  Sustainability Working Group as the platform for  bureaus to share identification, assessment, and  mitigation efforts for climate risks. Members of  the working group include key management and  regional bureaus. \nThe Department maintains more than 25,000  building assets at 287 locations overseas. The  current replacement value for these assets is  estimated at  $\\S75.2$   billion. For managing the risk  of exposure to natural hazards of these overseas  facilities, OBO uses a portfolio screening tool  that assesses risk levels for seven natural  hazards: flooding, extreme heat, extreme wind,  water stress, earthquake, tsunami, and landslide.  OBO is in process of adding two more natural  hazards to their screening tool in 2024: volcano  and wildfire.

During transfer season, employees turn in their  devices that keep them securely connected to  the Department of State’s networks and wait  for new devices at their onward assignment.  This gap disconnected employees during  their transfer, slowed their integration to  their onward assignment, and created asset  management redundancies. Tech for Life solves  this. Now, from the moment an employee  onboards, they are issued laptops and/or  phones that remain with them for the lifecycle  of the device – accompanying them as they  transfer assignments ensuring they stay  connected. This program has received warm  reception, decreased downtime, boosted  morale, and enabled smoother transitions.  \nSimplifying Asset Management : Tech for Life  aligns with the Secretary’s Modernization  Agenda by addressing persistent workforce  mobility and asset management challenges.  \nThe image shows two people sitting at a table with a laptop in front of them. They seem to be engaged in a discussion or perhaps working on something together. There are papers on the table, and a box that appears to be for an Apple product. The setting looks like an office or conference room.\nBureau of Information Resource Management staff  provide guidance to employees on the use of new  Tech for Life devices.  Department of State \nNo longer will overseas posts need to manage  the administrative complexities of issuing  and retrieving devices as employees come  and go. Tech for Life creates a leap forward  by providing centralized oversight and  accountability – allowing posts to refocus their  efforts on their priorities.  \nAs Tech for Life is implemented, the employee  experience is being enhanced, transitions are  becoming smoother, and asset management of  important network devices is optimized – all  bolstering our workforce capabilities while  supporting modernization efforts in  the Department.
