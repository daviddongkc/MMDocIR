If we are required to\nresubmit our capital plan, we must receive prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any capital distributions (including\ncommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases), other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital\ninstrument.\n\nDividends and Other Capital Distributions\n\nThe Company and TRS, as well as AENB and the Company’s insurance and other regulated subsidiaries, are limited in their\nability to pay dividends by statutes, regulations and supervisory policy.\n\nCommon stock dividend payments and share repurchases by the Company are subject to the oversight of the Federal\nReserve, as described above.

In addition to specific limitations on the dividends AENB can pay to TRS, federal banking\nregulators have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of a dividend if, in the banking regulator's opinion, payment of a\ndividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution.\n\nPrompt Corrective Action\n\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires, among other things, that federal banking regulators take prompt\ncorrective action in respect of depository institutions insured by the FDIC (such as AENB) that do not meet minimum\ncapital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories for FDIC-insured banks: well capitalized, adequately\ncapitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The FDIA imposes progressively\nmore restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the capital category in\nwhich an institution is classified. In order to be considered “well capitalized,” AENB must maintain CET1 capital, Tier 1\ncapital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios of 6.5 percent, 8.0 percent, 10.0 percent and 5.0 percent, respectively.\n\nUnder the FDIA, AENB could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposits (i.e., deposits raised through third-party\nbrokerage networks) or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in its normal\nmarket area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited), unless (1) it is well capitalized or (2) it is\nadequately capitalized and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A portion of our outstanding U.S. retail deposits are considered\nbrokered deposits for bank regulatory purposes. If a federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound\ncondition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practices, the regulator may reclassify our capital category\nor otherwise place restrictions on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposits.\n\nIn December 2020, the FDIC issued a final rule intended to update and modernize the FDIC’s brokered deposit regulations.\nEffective April 1, 2021, the final rule, among other things, expanded the definition of “deposit broker” and updated the\ninterest rate restrictions for less than well capitalized banks.\n\n14\n", "vlm_text": "Due to the economic uncertainty related to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve prohibited share repurchases in the third and  fourth quarters of 2020 for all bank holding companies participating in CCAR, but allowed them to pay common stock  dividends provided (a) they did not increase the amount of the dividend and (b) the dividends did not exceed the average of  a firm’s net income for the four preceding calendar quarters.

Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices\ncould affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things,\nregulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn,\nincluding as a result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with\ncaps on interchange fees.

There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange  fee caps and other provisions of the EU and UK payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and  agents in the EU and the UK. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are  subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent  relationships in the EU or the UK.  \nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge  card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been  overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Surcharging is an  adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately  impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or  differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse  effect on us. See “ Surcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of  operations ” under “Risk Factors.”  \nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally  licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under  the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, has issued a  mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. On April 23, 2021, the  Reserve Bank of India imposed restrictions on the ability of American Express Banking Corp. to engage in certain card  issuing activities in India from May 1, 2021 until it complies with a regulation requiring storage of payment transaction data  exclusively in India. This order does not impact existing customers. We are working towards complying with the regulation.  Governments in some countries also provide resources or protection to select domestic payment card networks. The  development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to  compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network.  "}

RISK FACTORS\n\nThis section highlights certain risks that could affect us and our businesses, broadly categorized as “Strategic, Business and\nCompetitive Risks,” “Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks” and “Credit, Liquidity and Market Risks.” You should carefully\nconsider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including\nthe “Risk Management” section under “MD&A,” which describes our approach to identifying, monitoring and managing the\nrisks we assume in conducting our businesses and provides certain quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market\nrisks. The risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business.\n\nStrategic, Business and Competitive Risks\n\nBusiness and economic conditions are a major driver of our results of operations and difficult conditions in the business\nand economic environment, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, have had a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness.\n\nWe offer a broad array of products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients and thus are very\ndependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing products. Slow\neconomic growth, economic contraction or shifts in broader consumer and business trends significantly impact customer\nbehaviors, including spending on our cards, the ability and willingness of Card Members to borrow and pay amounts owed to\nus, and demand for fee-based products and services. Factors such as consumer spending and confidence, household\nincome and housing prices, unemployment rates, business investment and inventory levels, bankruptcies, geopolitical\ninstability, public policy decisions, government spending, international trade relationships, interest rates, taxes, energy\ncosts, availability of capital and credit, inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and, ultimately, our\nprofitability. Such factors may also cause our earnings, billings, loan balances, credit metrics and margins to fluctuate and\ndiverge from expectations of analysts and investors, who may have differing assumptions regarding their impact on our\nbusiness, adversely affecting, and/or increasing the volatility of, the trading price of our common shares. The consequences\nof negative circumstances impacting us or the economic environment generally can be sudden and severe and can impact\ncustomer types and geographies in which we operate in very different ways.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies,\nfinancial markets and consumer and business spending. The pandemic and resulting containment measures adversely\nimpacted a significant portion of our network volumes (including, but not limited to, travel and entertainment (T&E)\nspending) and spending in certain categories have still not recovered to pre-pandemic levels. For example, airline-related\nbilled business was down 62 percent in 2021 relative to 2019 and spending by large and global corporate customers was\ndown 45 percent relative to 2019. The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of\nfactors, including the Omicron variant, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted, all of which\nmay continue to exacerbate many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\n\nThe extent to which our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by the continuing impacts of the\npandemic will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the\ncontinued spread and severity of the virus and new variants; the imposition or concern of the possible imposition of further\ncontainment measures; the availability, distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines; the extent to which\nvaccines are effective over the long term and against new, emerging variants; the extent and duration of the effect on the\neconomy, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact on consumers and businesses\nas forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to shutdowns, operational\nchanges and staffing issues; and how quickly and to what extent normal operating conditions and customer behaviors\nresume, such as with respect to travel, dining and in-person events.\n\nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic\nevents.\n\nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics,\ninformation or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattacks)\nand other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, fiscal and\nmonetary policies, trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or\ndomestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively\naffect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business\ninvestment, and demand for credit.\n\nAs noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and\nresults of operations. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center site, our headquarters were damaged as a result of\nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

The global macroeconomic outlook continues to remain uncertain due to a variety of  factors, including the Omicron variant, labor shortages, supply chain disruptions and inflation, and the impacts of the  COVID-19 pandemic may continue even after the outbreak has subsided and containment measures are lifted, all of which  may continue to exacerbate many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.  \nThe extent to which our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by the continuing impacts of the  pandemic will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including the  continued spread and severity of the virus and new variants; the imposition or concern of the possible imposition of further  containment measures; the availability, distribution and use of effective treatments and vaccines; the extent to which  vaccines are effective over the long term and against new, emerging variants; the extent and duration of the effect on the  economy, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact on consumers and businesses  as forbearance and government support programs end; the continued stress on businesses due to shutdowns, operational  changes and staffing issues; and how quickly and to what extent normal operating conditions and customer behaviors  resume, such as with respect to travel, dining and in-person events.  \nOur business is subject to the effects of geopolitical conditions, weather, natural disasters and other catastrophic  events.  \nGeopolitical conditions, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, severe weather, widespread health emergencies or pandemics,  information or cyber security incidents (including intrusion into or degradation of systems or technology by cyberattacks)  and other catastrophic events can have a material adverse effect on our business. Political and social conditions, fiscal and  monetary policies, trade wars and tariffs, labor shortages, prolonged or recurring government shutdowns, regional or  domestic hostilities, economic sanctions and the prospect or occurrence of more widespread conflicts could also negatively  affect our business, operations and partners, consumer and business spending, including travel patterns and business  investment, and demand for credit.  \nAs noted above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on our business and  results of operations. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center site, our headquarters were damaged as a result of  the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Recent hurricanes and other natural disasters have impacted spending and  "}

We may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rates  or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rates, for the reasons discussed above and others, which could  materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability, and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value- added services for merchants and Card Members.  \nSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.  \nIn certain countries, such as Australia and certain Member States in the EU, and in certain states in the U.S., merchants are  expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchases. In jurisdictions allowing surcharging, we have seen  merchant surcharging on American Express cards in certain merchant categories, and in some cases, either the surcharge is  greater than that applied to Visa and Mastercard cards or Visa and Mastercard cards are not surcharged at all (practices that  are known as differential surcharging), even though there are many cards issued on competing networks that have an equal  or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant.

A\nhypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact\non our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates\nchange. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card\nMembers carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment\nrequirements, further impacting our results of operations.

Increased credit risk, whether resulting from underestimating the  credit losses inherent in our portfolio of loans and receivables, deteriorating economic conditions (particularly in the United  States where, for example, Card Members were responsible for approximately 87 percent of our total Card Member loans  outstanding as of December 31, 2021), increases in the level of loan balances, changes in our mix of business or otherwise,  could require us to increase our provisions for losses and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  and financial condition.  \nInterest rate changes could materially adversely affect our earnings.  \nOur interest expense was approximately  $\\S1.3$   billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. If the rate of interest we pay on  our borrowings increases more or decreases less than the rate of interest we earn on our loans, our net interest yield, and  consequently our net interest income, could decrease. As of December 31, 2021, a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point  increase in market interest rates would have a detrimental impact on our annual net interest income of up to  $\\S206$   million. A  hypothetical immediate 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would have a smaller but still detrimental impact  on our annual net interest income. We expect the rates we pay on our deposits will change if benchmark interest rates  change. In addition, interest rate changes may affect customer behavior, such as impacting the loan balances Card  Members carry on their credit cards or their ability to make payments as higher interest rates lead to higher payment  requirements, further impacting our results of operations. For a further discussion of our interest rate risk, see “Risk  Management — Market Risk Management Process” under “MD&A.”  \nThe discontinuance of LIBOR may negatively impact our access to funding and the value of our financial instruments  and commercial agreements.  \nCertain of our financial instruments and commercial agreements will need to be amended or otherwise modified to replace  references to the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) with an alternative reference rate, as the LIBOR tenors referenced  are expected to be quoted only through June 2023. Alternative reference rates, such as the secured overnight financing rate,  are calculated using components different from those used in the calculation of LIBOR and may fluctuate differently than,  and not be representative of, LIBOR. In order to compensate for these differences, certain of our financial instruments and  commercial agreements allow for a benchmark replacement adjustment. However, there is no assurance that any  benchmark replacement adjustment will be sufficient to produce the economic equivalent of LIBOR, either at the  benchmark replacement date or over the life of such instruments and agreements.  \nUncertainty as to the replacement of LIBOR with alternative reference rates and the discontinuance of LIBOR generally may  negatively impact market liquidity, our access to funding and the trading market for our financial instruments. Furthermore,  the timing of implementation and use of alternative reference rates and corresponding adjustments or other reforms could  be subject to disputes, could cause the interest payable on our outstanding financial instruments and commercial  agreements to be materially different than expected and may impact the value of such instruments and agreements.  \nAdverse market conditions may significantly affect our access to, and cost of, capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.  \nOur ability to obtain financing in the debt capital markets for unsecured term debt and asset securitizations is dependent  on financial market conditions. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility across the financial markets, as well as adverse  developments affecting our competitors and the financial industry generally, could negatively impact market liquidity and  limit our access to funding required to operate our business. Such market conditions may also limit our ability to replace, in  a timely manner, maturing liabilities, satisfy regulatory capital requirements and access the funding necessary to grow our  business. In some circumstances, we may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital, which could decrease profitability and  significantly reduce financial flexibility. Additional factors affecting the extent to which we may securitize loans and  receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loans and receivables, the costs of securitizing our loans and  receivables, the demand for credit card asset-backed securities and the legal, regulatory, accounting or tax rules affecting  securitization transactions and asset-backed securities, generally. Our liquidity and cost of funds would also be adversely  affected by the occurrence of events that could result in the early amortization of our existing securitization transactions.  For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” under  “MD&A.”  "}

Corporate\nfunctions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other.\n\nOur range of products and services includes:\ne Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products\n\ne Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information\nproducts and services for merchants\n\ne Network services\n\ne Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs\ne Expense management products and services\n\ne Travel and lifestyle services\n\nOur various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses,\nmid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including\nmobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business\npartners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. We have a significant ownership\nposition in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). The commercial\narrangements with GBT include, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBT uses\nthe American Express brand, GBT’s support of certain of our partnerships, joint negotiation with travel suppliers and a\nstrategic relationship between GBT and our GCS business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT\nwas reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT’s acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights\nremain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with\nApollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG).

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL  CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) \nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW  \nBUSINESS INTRODUCTION  \nWe are a globally integrated payments company with three reportable operating segments: Global Consumer Services  Group (GCSG), Global Commercial Services (GCS) and Global Merchant and Network Services (GMNS). Corporate  functions and certain other businesses and operations are included in Corporate & Other.  \nOur range of products and services includes:  \nx   Credit card, charge card, banking and other payment and financing products  x   Merchant acquisition and processing, servicing and settlement, and point-of-sale marketing and information  products and services for merchants  x   Network services  x   Other fee services, including fraud prevention services and the design and operation of customer loyalty programs  x   Expense management products and services  x   Travel and lifestyle services  \nOur various products and services are sold globally to diverse customer groups, including consumers, small businesses,  mid-sized companies and large corporations. These products and services are sold through various channels, including  mobile and online applications, affiliate marketing, customer referral programs, third-party service providers and business  partners, direct mail, telephone, in-house sales teams, and direct response advertising. We have a significant ownership  position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, American Express Global Business Travel (GBT). The commercial  arrangements with GBT include, among other things, a long-term trademark license agreement pursuant to which GBT uses  the American Express brand, GBT’s support of certain of our partnerships, joint negotiation with travel suppliers and a  strategic relationship between GBT and our GCS business. During the fourth quarter of 2021, our economic interest in GBT  was reduced to approximately 41 percent from 50 percent as a result of GBT’s acquisition of Egencia; our voting rights  remain at 50 percent. Also during the fourth quarter of 2021, GBT entered into a business combination agreement with  Apollo Strategic Growth Capital (APSG). Upon consummation of the business combination, which is subject to the  satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by APSG’s shareholders and certain regulatory approvals,  the terms of certain of our commercial arrangements with GBT will be amended and GBT will become a public company.   \nThe following types of revenue are generated from our various products and services: \nx   Discount revenue, our largest revenue source, primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring  at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS)  partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card  Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment, or merchant discount, varies with,  among other factors, the industry in which the merchant does business, the merchant’s overall American Express- related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of  submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope for the related card acceptance  agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., domestic or global) and the transaction amount. In some instances,  an additional flat transaction fee is assessed as part of the merchant discount, and additional fees may be charged  such as a variable fee for “non-swiped” card transactions or for transactions using cards issued outside the United  States at merchants located in the United States;  x   Interest income, principally represents interest earned on outstanding loan balances;  x   Net card fees, represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card  and the number of cards for each account;  x   Other fees and commissions, primarily represent Card Member delinquency fees, foreign currency conversion fees  charged to Card Members, loyalty coalition-related fees, service fees earned from merchants, travel commissions  and fees, and Membership Rewards program fees; and  x   Other revenue, primarily represents revenues arising from contracts with our GNS partners (including commissions  and signing fees less issuer rate payments), cross-border Card Member spending, ancillary merchant-related fees,  earnings (losses) from equity method investments (including GBT), insurance premiums, and prepaid card and  Travelers Cheque-related revenue.

Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current\nperiod presentation.

However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by\nother companies.\n\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\nOur results for the year reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen in our business throughout 2021, and our\nstrategy of investing in our customers, brand and talent is helping in our effort to drive share, scale and relevance. Spending\non our network reached record levels and credit metrics remained around historic lows. Net income more than doubled\nversus the prior year to $8.1 billion and exceeded 2019 levels; contributing to this increase in Net income in the current year\nwas a $2.5 billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As certain\nof the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, and through the successful\nexecution of our investment strategy, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-\npandemic (2019) levels in 2021.\n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed\nbusiness, which represented 85 percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results, increased 25\npercent and continued to show different paces of recovery for G&S and T&E spend. G&S spend, which accounts for the\nmajority of our billed business, grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, and was 18 percent above 2019 levels. This\ngrowth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline\nspending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&E spend grew 59 percent versus the prior\nyear, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&E volumes reaching 82 percent of\n2019 levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased 26 percent versus the\nprior year and exceeded 2019 levels by 6 percent, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises.\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double digit growth in all our non-\ninterest revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by\ngrowth in Card Member spending. Other fees and commissions and Other revenues increased year-over-year, primarily\ndriven by higher travel-related revenues. Net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021 and were up 11 percent year over\nyear, as new card acquisitions increased, and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of\ninvestments we have made in our premium value propositions. Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year,\nprimarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.\n\nCard Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates\ndriven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased\nand resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the\nprior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved\nportfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and\nreceivables. We do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in 2022.\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or\nare variable based on usage, and increased year-over-year due to growth in spend and higher usage of travel-related\nbenefits. Additionally, our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our Membership\nRewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. During the year we increased marketing\ninvestments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Our ongoing investments in differentiated\nvalue propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased Card Member engagement and\nstrong retention rates. Our operating expenses for 2021 were in line with 2020; however, the current year included sizeable\nnet gains associated with the Amex Ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in\n2022.

The  $\\S_{ Ḋ }240 Ḍ$   million of eligible subordinated notes reflect a 60 percent, or  $\\S360$   million, reduction of Tier 2 capital  credit for the  $\\S600$   million subordinated debt issued in December 2014.   \nTier 1 Leverage Ratio  — Calculated by dividing Tier 1 capital by our average total consolidated assets for the most recent  quarter.   \nWe elected to delay the impact of the adoption of the CECL methodology on regulatory capital for two years followed by a  three-year phase-in period pursuant to rules issued by federal banking regulators (the CECL final rules). As of December 31,  2021, our reported regulatory capital excluded the  $\\S0.9$   billion impact to retained earnings upon the adoption of the CECL  methodology and 25 percent of the  $\\S0.9$   billion decrease in reserves for credit losses from January 1, 2020 to December 31,  2021. We have begun phasing in the  $\\S0.7$   billion cumulative amount that is not recognized in regulatory capital at 25 percent  per year beginning January 1, 2022. Refer to “Capital and Liquidity Regulation” under Part 1, Item 1. “Business - Supervision  and Regulation” for additional details.  \nAs a Category IV firm, we were not subject to the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2021 and will be participating  in the Federal Reserve's supervisory stress tests in 2022. We are required to submit to the Federal Reserve our annual  capital plan, on or before April 5 of each year.  \nOn June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve confirmed our SCB of 2.5 percent and resulting CET1 capital ratio requirement of 7  percent, which remain unchanged from the levels announced in August 2020.  \nDIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES  \nWe return capital to common shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The share repurchases reduce  common shares outstanding and generally more than offset the issuance of new shares as part of employee compensation  plans.   \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we returned  $\\S9.0$   billion to our shareholders in the form of common stock  dividends of  $\\S1.4$   billion and share repurchases of  $\\S7.6$   billion. We repurchased 46 million common shares at an average  price of   $\\S165.40$   in 2021. These dividend and share repurchase amounts collectively represent approximately 109 percent of  total capital generated during the year.  \nWe plan to increase the regular quarterly dividend on our common shares outstanding by approximately 20 percent, from  43 cents to 52 cents per share beginning with the first quarter of 2022, subject to approval by our Board of Directors.  \nIn addition, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid   $\\Updownarrow71$   million in dividends on non-cumulative perpetual  preferred shares outstanding. Refer to Note 16 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on our  preferred shares.  \nDuring the first six months of 2021, the Federal Reserve placed restrictions on common stock dividends and common share  repurchases for bank holding companies like us that participate in the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis  and Review (CCAR). These capital distribution restrictions ceased to apply on July 1, 2021. Our capital distributions have  since returned to being governed by the SCB framework and based on managing our CET1 risk-based capital ratio within a  10 to 11 percent target range. We may conduct share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market  purchases, 10b5-1 plans, privately negotiated transactions (including employee benefit plans) or other purchases, including  block trades, accelerated share repurchase programs or any combination of such methods as market conditions warrant  and at prices we deem appropriate.   \nOur decisions on capital distributions depend on various factors, including: our capital levels and regulatory capital  requirements; regulatory guidance or restrictions, actual and forecasted business results; economic and market conditions;  revisions to, or revocation of, the Federal Reserve’s authorization of our capital plan; and the supervisory stress test process.   \nPREFERRED SHARES  \nWe issue preferred shares to finance a portion of the Tier 1 capital requirements in excess of common equity requirements.  On August 3, 2021, we issued  $\\S1.6$   billion of  $3.550\\%$   Fixed Rate Reset Noncumulative Preferred Shares, Series D. With the  proceeds from that issuance, we redeemed in full the  $\\S850$   million of   $4.900\\%$   Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative  Preferred Shares, Series C on September 15, 2021 and the  $\\S750$   million of  $5.200\\%$   Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Noncumulative  Preferred Shares, Series B on November 15, 2021.

Our funding strategy and activities are integrated into our asset-liability\nmanagement activities.

Our financing needs are in large part a consequence of our proprietary card-issuing\nbusinesses, where we generally pay merchants for card transactions prior to reimbursement by Card Members and\ntherefore fund the merchant payments during the period Card Member loans and receivables are outstanding. In addition,\nwe maintain a liquidity position to meet regulatory requirements and support our business activities.\n\nWe aim to satisfy these financing needs with a diverse set of funding sources. The diversity of funding sources by type of\ninstrument, by tenor and by investor base, among other factors, mitigates the impact of disruptions in any one type of\ninstrument, tenor or investor. We seek to achieve diversity and cost efficiency in our funding sources by maintaining scale\nand market relevance in unsecured debt, asset securitizations and deposits, and access to secured borrowing facilities and\na committed bank credit facility.\n\nOur direct retail deposits have become a larger proportion of our funding over time.

The primary areas of\njudgment used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves relate to the determination of the appropriate\nR&S Period, the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default, and the methodology to incorporate current and\nfuture economic conditions. We use these models and assumptions, combined with historical loss experience, to determine\nthe reserve rates that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balances to produce our reserves for expected credit\nlosses for the R&S Period. The qualitative component is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully\ncaptured in the quantitative component.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-\nbacked securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of\nsuch securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of\nour Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts\nare reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAverage discount rate — This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting\nAmerican Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we\nacquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The\naverage discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.\n\nBilled business — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued\nby American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the\nlocation of the issuer.\n\nCapital ratios — Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether\nthe regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates.\nRefer to the Capital Strategy section under “Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity” for further related definitions\nunder Basel III.\n\nCard Member — The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans — Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and\nassociated card-related fees.\n\nCard Member receivables — Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full\non or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force — Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-\nin-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions,\nincluding joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity\nduring the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-\nforce is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of\npayment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely\neconomics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns.

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset- backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of  such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of  our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts  are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.   \nAverage discount rate —  This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting  American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we  acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The  average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.   \nBilled business  — Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued  by American Express.

Basic cards-in-force  excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in- force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.   \nCharge cards  — Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of  payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely  economics reflecting a Card Member’s most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay  the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features  offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases  with interest over time.  \nCobrand cards  — Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand  agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card  Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of  accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand  partner’s own loyalty program.   \nCredit cards  — Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It),  grace periods, and rate and fee structures.   \nDiscount revenue  — Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into  a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions  between the merchants and Card Members.   \nGoods and Services (G&S)-related volume  — Includes spend in merchant categories other than T&E-related merchant  categories, which includes B2B spending by small and medium size enterprise customers in our GCS segment.

As disclosed by management,  the URR assumption is used by management to estimate the number of points earned that will ultimately be redeemed in  future periods. Management uses statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card  product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12  months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative  of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.   \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Membership Rewards liability  is a critical audit matter are (i) the estimate of the URR involved significant judgment by management, which in turn led to a  high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the audit evidence relating  to the models, significant inputs and assumptions used by management, (ii) the audit effort involved the use of  professionals with specialized skill and knowledge and (iii) the estimate of the WAC involved significant judgment by  management, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing procedures and  evaluating audit evidence relating to the methodology.   \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall  opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to  the estimate of the Membership Rewards liability, including the URR and WAC assumptions. These procedures also  included, among others, (i) testing the completeness and accuracy of significant inputs to the statistical and actuarial  models used to estimate the URR assumption, including redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, and card  spend levels, (ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an  independent estimate of the URR assumption and comparing the independent estimate to management’s assumption to  evaluate its reasonableness, (iii) evaluating management’s methodology for determining the WAC assumption and (iv)  comparing our independently calculated Membership Rewards liability to management’s estimate.

These estimates are based, in part, on\nmanagement's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to\nreserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes.\nThese accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\nINCOME STATEMENT\n\nDiscount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a\ncard acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for\nfacilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as\npayment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant\nconducts business, the merchant’s overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the\nsettlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic\nscope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount.\nThe merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the\ntime the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in\nduration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those\nwith large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-\nperiod agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated\nexpiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term,\noften on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment\nnetwork.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with\ncertain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is\nindividually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card\nMember transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on\nbehalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer\nand us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other\nrevenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year\nor less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest\nrevenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\nNet Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the\nnumber of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member\ncancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net\ncard fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or\neconomic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized\nover the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are\n\nnow recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nOther Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign\ncurrency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other\nfees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period\ncovered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and\nfees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the\nperiod the fee is charged.

Interest income\nis recognized as earned using the effective interest method, which adjusts the yield for security premiums and discounts,\nfees and other payments, so that a constant rate of return is recognized on the investment security’s outstanding balance.\nAmounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be\nmade as scheduled.\n\nInterest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess\nof near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing\ndemand and call accounts.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate\npurposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories:\n\n(i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt,\nwhich primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact\nof derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt.\n\nMarketing and Business Development\n\nMarketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of\nadvertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and\nbusiness development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits and promotional\nrewards-based incentives for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate client incentive payments earned on\nachievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred.\n\nCard Member Rewards\n\nWe issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership\nRewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by\nspending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the\nrewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For\ncobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make\nassociated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the\ncobrand partner's own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels,\nattrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member\nrewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income.\n\nBALANCE SHEET\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities\npurchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days\n\nor less.

Amounts are recognized until securities are in default or when it becomes likely that future interest payments will not be  made as scheduled.  \nInterest on deposits with banks and other is recognized as earned, and primarily relates to the placement of cash, in excess  of near-term funding requirements, in interest-bearing time deposits, overnight sweep accounts, and other interest-bearing  demand and call accounts.  \nInterest Expense  \nInterest expense includes interest incurred primarily to fund Card Member loans and receivables, general corporate  purposes and liquidity needs, and is recognized as incurred. Interest expense is divided principally into two categories:  (i) deposits, which primarily relates to interest expense on deposits taken from customers and institutions, and (ii) debt,  which primarily relates to interest expense on our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, as well as the realized impact  of derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk on our long-term debt.  \nMarketing and Business Development  \nMarketing and business development expense includes costs incurred in the development and initial placement of  advertising, which are expensed in the year in which the advertising first takes place. Also included in Marketing and  business development expense are payments to our cobrand partners, Card Member statement credits and promotional  rewards-based incentives for qualifying charges on eligible card accounts, corporate client incentive payments earned on  achievement of pre-set targets, and certain payments to GNS partners. These costs are generally expensed as incurred.  \nCard Member Rewards  \nWe issue charge and credit cards that allow Card Members to participate in various rewards programs (e.g., Membership  Rewards, cash back and cobrand). Rewards expense is recognized in the period Card Members earn rewards, generally by  spending on their enrolled card products. For Membership Rewards and cash back, we record a liability that represents the  rewards that are expected to be redeemed, as well as, for Membership Rewards, the estimated cost of points earned. For  cobrand, we record a liability based primarily on rewards earned on Card Member spending on cobrand cards, and make  associated payments to our cobrand partners. The partner is liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the  cobrand partner’s own loyalty program. Card Member rewards liabilities are impacted over time by enrollment levels,  attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. Changes in the Card Member  rewards liabilities during the period are taken as an increase or decrease to the Card Member rewards expense in the  Consolidated Statements of Income.  \nBALANCE SHEET  \nCash and Cash Equivalents  \nCash and cash equivalents include cash and amounts due from banks, interest-bearing bank balances, including securities  purchased under resale agreements, restricted cash, and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days  or less. Restricted cash primarily represents amounts related to Card Member credit balances as well as upcoming debt  maturities of consolidated VIEs.  "}

We allocate goodwill to our reporting units for the purpose of impairment testing. A reporting unit is\ndefined as an operating segment, or a business that is one level below an operating segment, for which discrete financial\ninformation is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager.\n\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually as of June 30, or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change\nthat would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting units below its carrying value. Prior to\ncompleting the assessment of goodwill for impairment, we also perform a recoverability test of certain long-lived assets. We\nhave the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not\nthat the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Alternatively, we can perform a more detailed\nquantitative assessment of goodwill impairment.\n\nThis qualitative assessment entails the evaluation of factors such as economic conditions, industry and market\nconsiderations, cost factors, overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit-\nspecific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment.\n\nThe quantitative assessment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the\ncarrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount over and above the\nreporting unit's fair value.\n\nWhen measuring the fair value of our reporting units in the quantitative assessment, we use widely accepted valuation\ntechniques, applying a combination of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and market approach (market\nmultiples). When preparing discounted cash flow models under the income approach, we use internal forecasts to estimate\nfuture cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting units. To discount these cash flows, we use the expected cost of\nequity, determined by using a capital asset pricing model. We believe the discount rates appropriately reflect the risks and\nuncertainties in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally-developed forecasts. When using market\nmultiples under the market approach, we apply comparable publicly traded companies’ multiples (e.g., earnings or\nrevenues) to our reporting units’ actual results.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we performed a qualitative assessment in connection with our annual\ngoodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of each of our reporting\nunits exceeded their carrying values.\n\nPremises and Equipment\n\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Costs\nincurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset is placed in service. Depreciation is generally\ncomputed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 10 years for\nequipment, furniture and building improvements, and from 40 to 50 years for premises, which are depreciated based upon\ntheir estimated useful life at the acquisition date.\n\nCertain costs associated with the acquisition or development of internal-use software are also capitalized and recorded in\nPremises and equipment. Once the specific software feature is ready for its intended use, these costs are amortized ona\nstraight-line basis over the software's estimated useful life, generally 5 years. We review these assets for impairment using\nthe same impairment methodology used for our intangible assets.\n\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased\nfacility, or the economic life of the improvement, and range from 5 to 10 years. We recognize lease restoration obligations at\nthe fair value of the restoration liabilities when incurred and amortize the restoration assets over the lease term.\n\nLeases\n\nWe have operating leases worldwide for facilities and equipment, which, for those leases with terms greater than 12 months,\nare recorded as lease-related assets and liabilities. We do not separate lease and non-lease components.

The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1,\n2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current\nand future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), which is approximately three years,\nbeyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a\nreserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses.\n\nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the\nR&S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD),\nExposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&S Period. Beyond the R&S Period, we estimate\nexpected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates.\n\n* PD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off.\n\n* EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less\nexpected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer.

The CECL methodology, which became effective January 1,  2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current  and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period (R&S Period), which is approximately three years,  beyond the balance sheet date. We make various judgments combined with historical loss experience to determine a  reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce a reserve for expected credit losses.   \nWe use a combination of statistically-based models that incorporate current and future economic conditions throughout the  R&S Period. The process of estimating expected credit losses is based on several key models: Probability of Default (PD),  Exposure at Default (EAD), and future recoveries for each month of the R&S Period. Beyond the R&S Period, we estimate  expected credit losses by immediately reverting to long-term average loss rates.  \n•   PD models are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written-off.   •   EAD models are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write-off. This includes balances less  expected repayments based on historical payment and revolve behavior, which vary by customer. Due to the nature  of revolving loan portfolios, the EAD models are complex and involve assumptions regarding the relationship  between future spend and payment behaviors.  •   Recovery models are used to estimate amounts that are expected to be received from Card Members after default  occurs, typically as a result of collection efforts. Future recoveries are estimated taking into consideration the time  of default, time elapsed since default and macroeconomic conditions.   \nWe also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off accounts considering how long ago the  account was written off and future economic conditions, even if such expected recoveries exceed expected losses.

The vesting period is the shorter of the vesting schedule as defined in each  award agreement or the date an individual will become eligible to retire. Retirement eligibility is dependent upon age and/or  years of service.  \nSTOCK OPTIONS \nEach stock option has an exercise price equal to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock  options generally vest on the third anniversary of the grant date and have a contractual term of 10 years from the date of  grant.  \nThe weighted-average remaining contractual life and the aggregate intrinsic value (the amount by which the fair value of our  stock price exceeds the exercise price of the option) of the stock options outstanding, exercisable, and vested and expected  to vest as of December 31, 2021, were as follows:  \nThe table provides information about financial metrics related to stock options or similar financial instruments, dividing the data into three categories: \"Outstanding,\" \"Exercisable,\" and \"Vested and Expected to Vest.\" \n\n1. **Weighted-average remaining contractual life (in years)**\n   - Outstanding: 5.3 years\n   - Exercisable: 3.8 years\n   - Vested and Expected to Vest: 5.3 years\n\n2. **Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions)**\n   - Outstanding: $218 million\n   - Exercisable: $166 million\n   - Vested and Expected to Vest: $218 million\n\nThese figures typically represent the average remaining time before options expire and their current intrinsic value, respectively. The \"Outstanding\" category includes all options currently active, \"Exercisable\" includes only those options that can currently be exercised, and \"Vested and Expected to Vest\" includes options that are currently vested plus those expected to vest in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was  $\\S4$   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options, which  will be recognized ratably over the weighted-average remaining vesting period of 1.3 years.

In 2008, the tribunal rendered a  partial award, including a direction that an audit should take place to verify whether acquirer discount revenue related to  transactions occurring with airlines located in the Middle East region had been properly allocated to AEME since its  inception in 1992. In September 2021, the tribunal rendered a further partial award regarding the location of transactions  through non-physical channels. The consequences of the tribunal’s 2008 and 2021 partial awards on the allocation of airline  acquirer revenues will be determined in the remaining phase of the arbitration.  \nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain of our  international transactions, which are in various stages of audit, or are being contested in legal actions. While we believe we  have complied with all applicable tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax authorities may  determine that we owe additional VAT. In certain jurisdictions where we are contesting the assessments, we were required to  pay the VAT assessments prior to contesting.  \nOur legal proceedings range from cases brought by a single plaintiff to class actions with millions of putative class members  to governmental proceedings. These legal proceedings involve various lines of business and a variety of claims (including,  but not limited to, common law tort, contract, application of tax laws, antitrust and consumer protection claims), some of  which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. While some matters pending against us specify the  damages sought, many seek an unspecified amount of damages or are at very early stages of the legal process. Even when  the amount of damages claimed against us are stated, the claimed amount may be exaggerated and/or unsupported. As a  result, some matters have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or development of important factual  information and legal issues to enable us to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss, while other matters have  progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or a range of possible loss.  \nWe have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceedings. An accrual is recorded when it is both (a) probable that a  loss has occurred and (b) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. There may be instances in which an exposure to  loss exceeds the accrual. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings that could cause an increase  or decrease in the amount of the accrual that has been previously recorded, or a revision to the disclosed estimated range of  possible losses, as applicable.  \nFor those disclosed legal proceedings where a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of a recorded  accrual for legal or tax contingencies, or where there is no such accrual, and for which we are able to estimate a range of  possible loss, the current estimated range is zero to  $\\S170$   million in excess of any accruals related to those matters. This  range represents management’s estimate based on currently available information and does not represent our maximum  loss exposure; actual results may vary significantly. As such legal proceedings evolve, we may need to increase our range of  possible loss or recorded accruals.

These instruments enable end users to increase, reduce or alter exposure to\nvarious market risks and, for that reason, are an integral component of our market risk management. We do not transact in\nderivatives for trading purposes.\n\nMarket risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability values resulting from movements in market prices. Our market risk\nexposures include:\n\n¢ — Interest rate risk due to changes in the relationship between the interest rates on our assets (such as loans, receivables\nand investment securities) and the interest rates on our liabilities (such as debt and deposits); and\n\n¢ Foreign exchange risk related to transactions, funding, investments and earnings in currencies other than the U.S.\ndollar.\n\nWe centrally monitor market risks using market risk limits and escalation triggers as defined in our Asset/Liability\nManagement Policy. Our market exposures are in large part by-products of the delivery of our products and services.\n\nInterest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of Card Member receivables and fixed-rate loans with variable-rate\nborrowings, as well as through the risk to net interest margin from changes in the relationship between benchmark rates\nsuch as Prime, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight indexed\nswap rate. Interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed-rate lending products is managed by varying the\nproportion of total funding provided by short-term and variable-rate debt and deposits compared to fixed-rate debt and\ndeposits. In addition, interest rate swaps are used from time to time to economically convert fixed-rate debt obligations to\nvariable-rate obligations, or to convert variable-rate debt obligations to fixed-rate obligations. We may change the mix\nbetween variable-rate and fixed-rate funding based on changes in business volumes and mix, among other factors.\n\nForeign exchange exposures arise in four principal ways: (1) Card Member spending in currencies that are not the billing\ncurrency, (2) cross-currency transactions and balances from our funding activities, (3) cross-currency investing activities,\nsuch as in the equity of foreign subsidiaries, and (4) revenues generated and expenses incurred in foreign currencies, which\nimpact earnings. Our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreements to buy and sell currencies on a\nspot basis or by hedging this market exposure, to the extent it is economical, through various means, including the use of\nderivatives such as foreign exchange forwards.\n\nDerivatives may give rise to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that a derivative counterparty will default on, or\notherwise be unable to perform pursuant to, an uncollateralized derivative exposure. We manage this risk by considering the\ncurrent exposure, which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date, as well as estimating the maximum\npotential future exposure of the contracts over the next 12 months, considering such factors as the volatility of the\nunderlying or reference index.

Fair value is\nestimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the\ncurrent market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets.\n\nLong-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized\ndiscount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and\n(iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through\nthe use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted\nmarket prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future\ncash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and\ncredit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar\nterms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own\ncredit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads,\nbond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of\ncomparable maturities.\n\nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.

Fair value is  estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the  current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets.  \nLong-term Debt  \nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized  discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and  (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through  the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted  market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future  cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and  credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar  terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own  credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads,  bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of  comparable maturities.  \nNONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  \nWe have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets,  measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be  impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values.  During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not have any material assets that were measured at fair value  due to impairment.  "}
