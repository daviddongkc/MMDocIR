The survey was conducted under the direction of  SSRS. A combination of landline and cell phone random digit dial samples were used. Interviews  were conducted in English (969) and Spanish (35). Respondents in the landline sample were  selected by randomly asking for the youngest adult male or female who is now at home. Interviews  in the cell sample were conducted with the person who answered the phone, if that person was an  adult 18 years of age or older.

The weighting process takes into  account the disproportionate probabilities of household and respondent selection due to the  number of separate telephone landlines and cellphones answered by respondents and their  households, as well as the probability associated with the random selection of an individual  household member. Following application of the above weights, the sample is post-stratified and  balanced by key demographics such as age, race, sex, region, and education. The sample is also  weighted to reflect the distribution of phone usage in the general population, meaning the  proportion of those who are cellphone only, landline only, and mixed users.
