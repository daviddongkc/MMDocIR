The financial year\ngone by has taught all of us to value\n\nhis more than anything else. Many of\nyou may have lost your near and dear\nones. My heartfelt condolences to all\n\nof you. We in the HDFC Bank family\n\n‘00 have lost several colleagues. My\nhead bows in grief and sorrow. We are\nsupporting and will continue to support\nheir families.\n\nThe year gone by saw people across\n\nhe world being largely confined to their\nhomes with several travel restrictions in\nplace.

The\nReserve Bank of India (RBI) and the\nGovernment introduced a slew o\nmeasures to revive the economy.\nThese measures bore fruit with the\neconomy growing by 1.6 per cent in\n\nhe fourth quarter of the year while it\nhad contracted by 24.4 per cent at the\nend of the first quarter. In the current\ninancial year India is expected to be\none of the fastest growing economies\nin the world. The second wave of the\npandemic has dented the optimism\n\na bit, but the peak of the pandemic\nclearly appears to be behind us. As the\nvaccine rollout gathers momentum, the\neconomy is expected to be on a much\nstronger footing especially from the\nsecond quarter.\n\nIntroduction to Our\n\nOur Performance\n\nWe posted a healthy growth in Net\nProfit, Net Interest Income and Balance\nSheet size without compromising on\nasset quality. Net Profit increased by\n18.5 per cent to $31,116.5 Crore in\n\nFY21 and balance sheet size by 14.1\nper cent to 71,746,871 Crore.

Net interest income, an indication\nof the difference between interest\nearned and interest paid grew by 15.5\nper cent to 764,879.6 Crore. The details\nof our performance are elaborated in\nthe report.\n\n| am proud of my colleagues and thank\nall of them (and their families too) for\nthis performance despite, the difficulties\nthey had to face during the year. As an\norganisation we learnt and relearnt on\nthe way, pivoted our way to a Work from\nHome culture and continued to serve\nour customers. | am delighted by the\nway our colleagues responded to the\nmyriad challenges we all faced.\n\nStrengths\n\nAt this point | would like to elaborate\non some of our strengths and also talk\nabout things that we could have done\nbetter.\n\nOne of our biggest strengths has been\nthe legacy of over a quarter century.\nOur iconic ex-Managing Director, Mr\nAditya Puri created an institution with\nstrong foundation and fundamentals.\nIt is a huge advantage as well as a\nprivilege to inherit and build upon this.\nThanks to his leadership, we today\nhave a strong balance sheet with\namong the lowest NPAs in the banking\nindustry and strong capitalisation. This\nhas helped us to lend even during\ndifficult times, build market leadership\nand deliver shareholder value without\ncompromising on our commitment to\nsociety and the environment.\n\nAreas for Improvement\n\nTechnology. Quite frankly, it continues\n‘0 remain both a strength as well as an\narea for improvement. In the last couple\nof years our technological capability\nhas been questioned. Justifiably. But\nat the same time, we cannot afford\n\n‘o miss the big picture. We would not\nhave become a Bank of this scale, size,\nand grown market share consistently\nyear after year, without having a strong\nechnology backbone. We are one\n\nof the largest transaction processing\nBanks and have come up with cutting\nedge customer solutions like 10-second\npersonal loans and digital loan against\nmutual funds. Not to forget the rollout\nof Video KYC during the pandemic\nwhich helped people to become a\nbank customer from the safety of\n\nheir homes.

In the last 28 months, we\nhave, however, been in the spotlight\n\nfor the wrong reasons when it comes\n\n‘0 technology. Also, there have been\ndeficiencies in compliance.\n\nThe technology problems as well as\n\nhe compliance issues have led to\nregulatory actions. This brings me to my\nlocus areas.\n\nMy Focus Areas\n\nhe last technology downtime led to\nhe Reserve Bank of India banning\n\nus from issuing new credit cards as\nwell as putting on hold new launches\nunder Digital 2.0 initiative. Further, the\nregulator also appointed a third party\naudit of our IT systems. This audit is\nnow over and the report has been\nsubmitted to the regulator. We now\nawait the decision from RBI.\n\nAs a Bank we are certainly sorry for\nwhat has happened.

But this is always\nan important area of focus and\naction plans are underway for further\nrobustness.\n\n(4) Monitoring Mechanisms:\n\nAn enhanced application monitoring\nmechanism has been put in place\nacross the board to enable us to keep\nour IT systems Always On.\n\nWhile we execute this Technology\nTransformation agenda, there will\nsometimes be pain and outages beyond\nour control.

Henceforth, all building premises that  we occupy will have only LED lights. \nBranches with the energy  management system implemented as  of March 31, 2021  \n600 \nEnergy efficient space  cooling \nBuilding management  and Green Buildings \nEnergy saved during FY21 on account  of auto controls in branches  \nIn FY21, we installed EC Fan Motors in  55 Air Handling Units (AHUs) resulting  in potential savings of 0.2 Million kWh of  energy per year. We have also installed  inverter ACs at our locations, which  helped save over 1.75 Million kWh of  electricity during FY21. We also saved  32,325 kWh of electricity by installing  VRF HVAC units at our back offices.  \nWe have incorporated several changes  within our infrastructure to improve  energy efficiency through auto controls  and environment-friendly equipment.  We have LEED Gold certified offices in  Mumbai and Bhubaneswar. In addition,  new buildings in Mohali and Palava  training centres are being constructed  to meet the IGBC gold certification  standards. We have also implemented  elevator and equipment scheduling to  reduce our energy consumption, and  installed occupancy sensors, capacitor  banks as well as Building Management  Systems at several of our operating  locations. The energy management  module with auto controls deployed  across select branches since FY19  resulted in potential energy savings  of about   $16\\%$  . We plan to extend  this initiative to an additional 2,000  branches across the country. \n4.4 Million kWh \nDuring FY21, not only our energy  intensity (GJ/employee) decreased  by over  $30\\%$   over FY20, but we also  achieved a reduction of over  $28\\%$   in  absolute energy consumption. The  reduction in energy consumption  is attributed to the comprehensive  set of energy reduction measures  implemented at our operating locations,  as well as the temporary reduction  in activity/energy load at some of  our operating locations as a result  of COVID-19 induced lockdown and  movement restrictions. \nEfficient data centres \nDisposal of old assets at three of our  data centres led to the avoidance of   1.4 Million kWh of electricity during  FY21. Our Bangalore data centre  ‘Netmagic-DC3B’ is a certified  green data centre under the IGBC  Green Data Centre Rating System.  We have implemented several other  energy-saving measures including  upgradation to efficient cooling units,  \nWe also surpassed our energy targets.  In FY21, we achieved a reduction  of about   $34\\%$   in absolute energy  consumption, and  $24\\%$   in energy  intensity   $(\\mathsf{G}\\mathsf{J}/\\mathsf{r}$  per employee) from base  year FY19. \nIGBC Platinum Certification  for our data centre in  Bangalore "}

We work  towards increasing sensitisation of  managers and leaders across levels to  enable them to develop a conscious  and comprehensive understanding of  the challenges women often face as  a result of unconscious bias. As part  of this initiative, we have launched an  audio-visual campaign, ‘Uncovering  Unconscious Biases’, which focuses  on creating an inclusive work  environment. We have also launched  #Intentional Inclusion video series  to create overall awareness around  unconscious biases relating to gender,  disability, age, marital status, sexual  orientation, among others. \nWe are also making efforts to prioritise  female hiring, e.g., by offering additional  referral bonus for women candidates.  We have introduced policies and  processes to enable women  employees to manage professional  and personal commitments – such  as offering flexi work time and part- time work arrangements with the  objective of arresting attrition. To  improve representation of women in  leadership positions, we have designed  a dedicated, multi-phased, three- year-long leadership programme in  middle-management, called the Career  Accelerator Programme. Our flagship  programme on diversity, ‘Shrishti’ aims  to create a level-playing field for women  employees.  \nWe strive to create and maintain  an inclusive work environment for  all our employees irrespective of  gender, caste, creed, colour, sexual  orientation, religion, among others. We  provide equal and fair remuneration  opportunities, irrespective of gender.  We have adopted a gender diversity  target to increase the representation of  women in our workforce to  $25\\%$   by   FY25\\*. With this objective, we are  working simultaneously on talent  acquisition, as well as talent retention.  We have launched a unique endeavour  called Careers 2.0, which has provided  a platform for transitioning back to work  for skilled women professionals who  had opted for a break due to family/ personal reasons. So far, we have  onboarded 33 women through this  initiative.  "}

The digital initiative  will make CWMI accessible  \nto public while digitising the  entire process of ranking states.  Data for crucial indicators such  as groundwater restoration,  irrigation management, on-farm  water use, rural/urban drinking  water supply as well as water  policy frameworks can be viewed  in various formats for agencies  \nto forecast, plan and manage  water resources. The results of  the entire exercise will be used  to propel action in the states to  improve respective outcomes,  besides improving upon data  collection and performance  monitoring mechanisms. \n $\\widehat{\\pmb{\\mathscr{z}}})$   Promotion of Education \nThe programme is being executed in partnership with several leading non-governmental  organisations. It encompasses teacher training, scholarships, career guidance as well as  infrastructure support, such as building toilets in schools and improving classrooms.  \nThe ‘Teaching the Teacher’ (3T)  programme seeks to transform  education in government schools  across India by improving the skills of  teachers. Our flagship Zero Investment  Innovations for Education Initiatives  (ZIIEI) was launched under the 3T  programme to find and systematically  scale up scattered, unrecognised  \nbut effective and zero-cost solutions  created by teachers to improve existing  systems and processes. Under 3T,  teachers across 28 states/union  territories have been trained, by inviting  ideas from them and implementing the  selected ideas in schools to improve  the quality of education.  \nIn addition, with the objective of making  learning fun and engaging for the  students, we integrated technology with  education and have so far supported  state-run schools in eight states by  introducing digital classrooms.  \nThe image shows a classroom setting where a student is standing and reading from a book.

The data is categorized into different sections including income statements elements, funds, and key financial ratios:\n\n1. **Income and Expenses:**\n   - **Interest income** and **Interest expense** show the revenue from interest and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, respectively.\n   - **Net interest income** is calculated by subtracting interest expense from interest income.\n   - **Other income** refers to income not related to the core banking operations.\n   - **Net revenues** are the sum of Net interest income and Other income.\n   - **Operating costs** include expenses related to running the bank's operations.\n   - **Operating result** is the difference between Net revenues and Operating costs.\n   - **Profit before tax** is Operating result less provisions and other adjustments.\n   - **Profit after tax** is Profit before tax minus Provision for taxation.\n\n2. **Funds:**\n   - **Deposits** represent the total amount of customer deposits.\n   - **Subordinated debt** indicates long-term debt that ranks below other debts in case of liquidation.\n   - **Stockholders' equity** is the amount invested by shareholders.\n   - **Working funds** refer to the total resources available for conducting the bank's operations.\n   - **Loans** are the total amount of money lent to customers.\n   - **Investments** imply financial assets held by the bank.\n\n3. **Key Ratios:**\n   - **Earnings per share (₹)** shows the portion of a company's profit allocated to each share of stock.\n   - **Return on average net worth** indicates the profitability concerning shareholders' equity.\n   - **Tier 1 capital ratio** is a measure of a bank's core equity capital compared with its total risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe data is presented year by year to show the progression or changes in the bank's financial status throughout the specified period.\nThe table shows the following financial metrics over four periods or categories:\n\n1. **Earnings per share (₹)**\n2. **Return on average net worth** (%)\n3. **Tier 1 capital ratio** (%)\n4. **Total capital ratio** (%)\n5. **Dividend per share (₹)**\n6. **Dividend payout ratio** (%)\n7. **Book value per share as at March 31 (₹)**\n8. **Market price per share as at March 31 (₹)**\n9. **Price to earnings ratio**\n\nEach row represents a different financial metric, and each column (left to right) contains data for a specific period or category.\nThe table appears to present financial data over several years, specifically from 2015-2016 to 2020-2021. The values seem to be expressed in crore, which is a unit in the Indian numbering system equivalent to ten million. Here’s a breakdown of the columns and possible interpretation of the table:\n\n1. **Annual Data**: Each column corresponds to a fiscal year, ranging from 2015-2016 to 2020-2021. The numbers represent some form of financial metrics, likely revenue, expenses, or other financial statements.\n\n2. **Data Categories**: \n   - The first section of numbers (e.g., 60,221.45, 69,305.96) likely represents the main category or headline figures for each fiscal year.\n   - Subcategories beneath them (slightly indented and in smaller font size) most likely represent detailed breakdowns or components contributing to the main figure.\n\n3. **Highlighted Figures**: Certain rows and figures are highlighted in bold which suggests the importance or key metrics for those specific years.\n\n4. **Growth Indicators/Percentages**: Towards the bottom of the table, there are percentages and decimal numbers (e.g., 24.42, 28.59, 17.97%). These might be financial ratios, growth rates, or other key performance indicators.\n\n5. **Asterisks**: The use of asterisks (e.g., ***) may denote data that is provisional, estimated, or not finalized.\n\nWithout a caption or additional context, it's difficult to be certain, but the layout and figures suggest that the table likely represents a financial summary or report over a period of time for a company or sector, providing important figures and possibly trends in performance."}

To recall, the World Health Organization declared\non March 12, 2020 that the virus is a pandemic. On March 23,\n2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown\nfor 21 days, which got further extended till May 31, 2020 with\nsome relaxations. India enforced one of the strictest lockdowns\nat an early phase of rising cases to limit the spread of the virus.\nDaily COVID-19 cases peaked in September touching a high of\n~98,000 and easing to ~8,600 in early February 2021, due to\nintroduction of social distancing norms, localised lockdowns and\ncontainment measures.\n\nThe Government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced\na host of measures to cushion the direct impact of the lockdown\non the economy. This helped GDP growth come off its low of\n-24.4 per cent in Q1 and -7.4 per cent in Q2 to +0.5 per cent in\nQ3 and +1.6 per cent in Q4 2020-21. Looking at the internals,\nagriculture growth continued to remain positive (registering a\ngrowth of 3.6 per cent in 2020-21) due to the relative insulation of\nthe rural sector from the virus. Manufacturing growth contracted\nby 7.2 per cent in 2020-21. However, the sector showed signs\nof recovery in H2 2020-21 - with a contraction of 18.7 per cent\nin H1 2020-21 but picked upto + 1.6 per cent in Q3 and +\n6.9 per cent in Q4. Service sector remained a laggard with a\ncontraction of 8.4 per cent in 2020-21. Domestic demand began\nto show green shoots in the second half of the year as activity\n\n128\n\nresumed. Private consumption indicators such as production\nof consumer durables and non-durables gathered pace in Q3\nalong with passenger vehicle (PV) sales that turned green in H2\nFY21. Encouragingly, GST collections rose to = 1.23 trillion in\nMarch 2021, averaging % 1.13 trillion in H2 FY21 as compared to\nan average collection of = 0.76 trillion in H1 FY21.\n\nThe Government announced a stimulus package of & 20 trillion\nin five different tranches in FY 2020-21 to provide support to\n1) the MSMEs and the NBFCs via a credit guarantee scheme\nand liquidity support 2) migrant labourers via direct spending and\ngenerating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA\n8) small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4)\nannounced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power,\nagriculture, etc.\n\nOn the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps\n‘0 provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system. The\nRBI delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 basis points (bps) since\nFebruary 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The\ncentral bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity\nconstraints such as the announcement of the moratorium,\niquidity infusion through TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo\nOperations) for NBFCs (% 500 billion), liquidity facility of = 500\nbillion for mutual funds, liquidity support of = 500 billion for all\nIndia financial institutions and a cut in the CRR (Cash Reserve\nRatio) by 100 bps to 3 per cent. These measures helped anchor\nborrowing costs in the economy, support credit growth and\ncushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market.\n\nLooking at the inflation side, CPI inflation averaged 6.7 per cent in\nH1 FY21 mainly due to higher food prices on account of COVID-\nled supply disruptions. Inflation eased below RBI’s upper band\nof 6.0 per cent from December 2020 to February 2021. In FY\n2020-21, the headline inflation averaged 6.2 per cent, above\nhe RBI's target range of 4 +/-2 per cent. In FY 2021-22, CPI\nnflation rose to 6.3 per cent in May-21 from 4.2 per cent in\nApr-21, breaching the RBI’s upper threshold of 6 per cent for\nhe first time in six months. Apart from higher fuel and food\ninflation, a large part of this increase was driven by higher core\ninflation, possibly reflecting the impact of second wave related\nsupply disruptions and a pass through of cost push pressures.\nGoing forward, we expect inflation to remain above 6 per cent\nfor the next 3 months. For FY 2021-22, we expect the headline\ninflation to average 6.1% led by higher commodity prices and\nsticky core inflation.\n\nOn the policy front, we expect the central bank to keep its rates\nunchanged in FY 2021-22 and maintain an accommodative\nstance. The RBI is likely to only gradually reduce the liquidity\nsurplus in the system once it is confident about the prospects of\ngrowth recovery. The central bank is likely to continue managing\nthe yield curve, especially the benchmark yield through open\nmarket operations (sterilised and unsterilsed) and the latest\nannounced G-SAP bond buying programme in order to contain\nborrowing costs in the economy and improve transmission.\n\nIntroduction to Our How We\nOverview HDFC Bank Performance Create Value\n\nOn the policy front, we expect the central\nbank to keep its rates unchanged in FY 2021-\n22 and maintain an accommodative stance.\n\nIn the financial sector, the onset of COVID-19 weighed down\non credit growth while the deposit growth remained robust.\nIn FY 2020-21, the credit growth averaged at 5.9 per cent as\ncompared to 9.5 per cent y-o-y in FY 2019-20. A sharp slowdown\nin economic activity as reflected by a 7.3 per cent contraction in\nGDP weighed on credit demand. On the flip side, deposit growth\nimproved to 10.9 per cent in FY 2020-21 from 9.9 per cent in FY\n2019-20. The improvement in deposit growth could be reflecting\npandemic related saving tendency among individuals. In Apr-\n21, while credit growth came in at 5.7 per cent, deposit growth\nracked at 10.3 per cent.\n\nLooking at the credit sectoral level, the weakness was recorded\nin the industry sector (large industries) while credit deployment\n‘0 personal loans and to services sector rose albeit at a slower\npace. As per the RBI’s January 2021 Financial Stability Report,\nhe GNPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks eased to 7.5\nper cent in September 2020 from 9.3 per cent in September\n2019. That said, the central bank estimates the ratio to increase\n‘0 13.5 per cent by September 2021. The GNPA could escalate\n0 14.8 per cent if the macroeconomic environment worsens\ninto a severe stress scenario. Heading into FY 2021-22, credit\ngrowth outlook is expected to improve amid improvement in\nGDP growth and as liquidity remains comfortable.\n\nFor the financial sector, the Government announced the Partial\nCredit Guarantee Scheme (PCGS) 2.0 to provide liquidity support\nor NBFCs. Under this scheme, the Government provides a\nsovereign guarantee for the first 20 per cent loss to the public\nsector banks buying AAA and below rated paper issued by the\nNBFCs/MFls/HFCs.\n\nTo recall, the stimulus package worth % 20 trillion (10 per cent\nof GDP) announced by the Government had a clear focus on\nhe MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the\norganised and unorganised segments and a critical component\nof the domestic industrial supply chain. The MSME sector\nhat encompasses a wide range of industries had been under\nconsiderable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence\nof COVID-19. This made them particularly vulnerable to the\nlockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider\nof funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period\nof stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks\nand the market. Thus, the stimulus package focused on the\nsurvival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-19 crisis\nand also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was\nits attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly\nand to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing\nthe risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them\nby providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a\nfraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose\n\nStatutory Reports and\nFinancial Statements\n\nResponsible\nOur Strategy Business\n\nVehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an\nequity stake. Thus, for instance, the targeted credit flow of = 300\nbillion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs\nwas backed by a 100 per cent Government of India guarantee\ngiven through National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company\n(NCGTC). Other measures included creating a fund of funds for\nMSMEs, PCGS for NBFCs/MFIs and providing subordinate debt\n‘or stressed MSMEs through a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust.\n\nThe direct fiscal spending component (on MNREGA, EPF\nsupport for business and workers, foodgrain supply for migrant\nworkers and enhancing micro food enterprises among other\nhings) is relatively low and stands at % 2 trillion or 1 per cent of\nGDP. Instead, the broad strategy of the stimulus is to remove\nbottlenecks on the supply side for the smaller and labour-\nintensive firms to set off a ‘virtuous cycle’ of more viable\noperations, increased production and employment, and higher\nincomes that would translate into enhanced demand.\n\nThe broad strategy of the Government’s\nstimulus is to remove bottlenecks on the\nsupply side for the smaller and labour-\nintensive firms to set off a ‘virtuous cycle’\nof more viable operations, increased\nproduction and employment, and higher\nincomes that would translate into enhanced\ndemand.\n\nThere are non-financial measures as well that aim to benefi\nMSMEs. The upward revision of turnover and investment limi\n(Micro: turnover increased to % 5 crore, investment increased to\n= 1 crore; Small: Turnover increased to = 50 crore and investment\nincreased to = 10 crore; Medium: Turnover increased to = 100\ncrore and investment increased to & 20 crore) would help MSMEs\nexpand operations considerably without fear of losing some of\nhe fiscal and other benefits that the segment enjoys. In addition\no the aforementioned measures, the Government of India\nannounced measures to facilitate capex and help businesses.\nMeasures announced included - guaranteed collateral free\ncredit support for 26 stressed sectors, = 1.46 lakh crore boos\nfor Atmanirbhar manufacturing, Production Linked Incentive (PLI)\nscheme for sectors such as electronics, textile, telecom, etc. and\nadditional outlay of = 102 billion towards industrial expenditure,\nindustrial incentives and development of defence equipment.\n\nFrom the Government side, trend in capex has also been\nencouraging. In FY 2020-21, the Government has spent INR\n4.3 trillion on capex, which is a 26.5 per cent y-o-y increase from\nFY 2019-20. For the ongoing fiscal year, the Government has\nbudgeted capex at an 18 year high of 2.5 per cent of GDP. In INR\nlerms, FY 2021-22 capex is budgeted at INR 5.3 trillion, which\nmarks an increase of 30.5 per cent from the last year.\n\nIN fiscal 2020-21, while export demand dipped by 7.2 per cent,\nimports shrank 17.6 per cent, reflecting pandemic related\n\nHDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21 129\n", "vlm_text": "Issuance of Equity Shares and Employee  Stock Option Scheme (ESOP) \nAs on March 31, 2021, the issued, subscribed and paid up capital  of your Bank stood at  \\`  5,512,776,482/- comprising 5,512,776,482  equity shares of  $\\Xi\\uparrow/-$   each.

Encouragingly, GST collections rose to  \\`  1.23 trillion in  March 2021, averaging  \\`  1.13 trillion in H2 FY21 as compared to  an average collection of  \\`  0.76 trillion in H1 FY21. \n\nThe Government announced a stimulus package of  $\\gtrdot20$   trillion  in five different tranches in FY 2020-21 to provide support to  1) the MSMEs and the NBFCs via a credit guarantee scheme  and liquidity support 2) migrant labourers via direct spending and  generating employment via enhanced allocation to MNREGA  3) small traders, vendors and farmers via loan facilities and 4)  announced structural reforms across sectors like coal, power,  agriculture, etc. \nOn the monetary policy side, the RBI also took a number of steps  to provide liquidity and enhance credit flow in the system. The  RBI delivered a total rate cut (repo) of 115 basis points (bps) since  February 2020, taking the repo rate down to 4.0 per cent. The  central bank also took a slew of measures to address liquidity  constraints such as the announcement of the moratorium,  liquidity infusion through TLTRO (Targeted Long Term Repo  Operations) for NBFCs ( \\`  500 billion), liquidity facility of   $\\nexists~500$    billion for mutual funds, liquidity support of   $\\mp\\ 500$   billion for all  India financial institutions and a cut in the CRR (Cash Reserve  Ratio) by 100 bps to 3 per cent. These measures helped anchor  borrowing costs in the economy, support credit growth and  cushioned the impact of the disruptions in the financial market. \nLooking at the inflation side, CPI inflation averaged 6.7 per cent in  H1 FY21 mainly due to higher food prices on account of COVID- led supply disruptions. Inflation eased below RBI’s upper band  of 6.0 per cent from December 2020 to February 2021. In FY  2020-21, the headline inflation averaged 6.2 per cent, above  the RBI’s target range of   $4+/2$   per cent. In FY 2021-22, CPI  inflation rose to 6.3 per cent in May-21 from 4.2 per cent in   $\\mathsf{A p r-21}$  , breaching the RBI’s upper threshold of 6 per cent for  the first time in six months. Apart from higher fuel and food  inflation, a large part of this increase was driven by higher core  inflation, possibly reflecting the impact of second wave related  supply disruptions and a pass through of cost push pressures.  Going forward, we expect inflation to remain above 6 per cent  for the next 3 months. For FY 2021-22, we expect the headline  inflation to average  $6.1\\%$   led by higher commodity prices and  sticky core inflation. \nOn the policy front, we expect the central bank to keep its rates  unchanged in FY 2021-22 and maintain an accommodative  stance. The RBI is likely to only gradually reduce the liquidity  surplus in the system once it is confident about the prospects of  growth recovery. The central bank is likely to continue managing  the yield curve, especially the benchmark yield through open  market operations (sterilised and unsterilsed) and the latest  announced G-SAP bond buying programme in order to contain  borrowing costs in the economy and improve transmission. \nOn the policy front, we expect the central  bank to keep its rates unchanged in FY 2021- 22 and maintain an accommodative stance. \nIn the financial sector, the onset of COVID-19 weighed down  on credit growth while the deposit growth remained robust.  In FY 2020-21, the credit growth averaged at 5.9 per cent as  compared to 9.5 per cent y-o-y in FY 2019-20. A sharp slowdown  in economic activity as reflected by a 7.3 per cent contraction in  GDP weighed on credit demand. On the flip side, deposit growth  improved to 10.9 per cent in FY 2020-21 from 9.9 per cent in FY  2019-20. The improvement in deposit growth could be reflecting  pandemic related saving tendency among individuals. In Apr- 21, while credit growth came in at 5.7 per cent, deposit growth  tracked at 10.3 per cent. \nLooking at the credit sectoral level, the weakness was recorded  in the industry sector (large industries) while credit deployment  to personal loans and to services sector rose albeit at a slower  pace. As per the RBI’s January 2021 Financial Stability Report,  the GNPA ratio of scheduled commercial banks eased to 7.5  per cent in September 2020 from 9.3 per cent in September  2019. That said, the central bank estimates the ratio to increase  to 13.5 per cent by September 2021. The GNPA could escalate  to 14.8 per cent if the macroeconomic environment worsens  into a severe stress scenario. Heading into FY 2021-22, credit  growth outlook is expected to improve amid improvement in  GDP growth and as liquidity remains comfortable. \nFor the financial sector, the Government announced the Partial  Credit Guarantee Scheme (PCGS) 2.0 to provide liquidity support  for NBFCs. Under this scheme, the Government provides a  sovereign guarantee for the first 20 per cent loss to the public  sector banks buying AAA and below rated paper issued by the  NBFCs/MFIs/HFCs. \nTo recall, the stimulus package worth  $\\mp\\;20$   trillion (10 per cent  of GDP) announced by the Government had a clear focus on  the MSME sector, a key provider of employment in both the  organised and unorganised segments and a critical component  of the domestic industrial supply chain. The MSME sector  that encompasses a wide range of industries had been under  considerable stress for a prolonged period before the incidence  of COVID-19. This made them particularly vulnerable to the  lockdown and its aftermath. The NBFC sector, a major provider  of funding to the MSMEs had also been going through a period  of stress, particularly in its access to finances both from banks  and the market. Thus, the stimulus package focused on the  survival of both MSMEs and NBFCs through the COVID-19 crisis  and also their revival. The critical element of the stimulus was  its attempt to facilitate the flow of credit to both MSMEs directly  and to NBFCs. The Government aimed to do this by reducing  the risk taken by banks and other institutions in lending to them  by providing explicit guarantees either on the entire loan or a  fraction. The guarantees delivered were through Special Purpose  Vehicles (SPVs) in which the Government had initially taken an  equity stake. Thus, for instance, the targeted credit flow of  \\`  300  billion in the form of collateral free loans to the smaller MSMEs  was backed by a 100 per cent Government of India guarantee  given through National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company  (NCGTC). Other measures included creating a fund of funds for  MSMEs, PCGS for NBFCs/MFIs and providing subordinate debt  for stressed MSMEs through a Credit Guarantee Fund Trust. \n\nThe direct fiscal spending component (on MNREGA, EPF  support for business and workers, foodgrain supply for migrant  workers and enhancing micro food enterprises among other  things) is relatively low and stands at  $\\mp\\;2$   trillion or 1 per cent of  GDP. Instead, the broad strategy of the stimulus is to remove  bottlenecks on the supply side for the smaller and labour- intensive firms to set off a ‘virtuous cycle’ of more viable  operations, increased production and employment, and higher  incomes that would translate into enhanced demand. \nThe broad strategy of the Government’s  stimulus is to remove bottlenecks on the  supply side for the smaller and labour- intensive firms to set off a ‘virtuous cycle’  of more viable operations, increased  production and employment, and higher  incomes that would translate into enhanced  demand. \nThere are non-financial measures as well that aim to benefit  MSMEs. The upward revision of turnover and investment limit \n\n (Micro: turnover increased to  $\\mp\\,5$   crore, investment increased to \n\n  $\\mp\\;\\uparrow$   crore; Small: Turnover increased to  $\\mp\\,50$   crore and investment  increased to  $\\textsuperscript{\\texttt{F}10}$   crore; Medium: Turnover increased to  \\`  100  crore and investment increased to  $\\gtrdot20$   crore) would help MSMEs  expand operations considerably without fear of losing some of  the fiscal and other benefits that the segment enjoys. In addition  to the aforementioned measures, the Government of India  announced measures to facilitate capex and help businesses.  Measures announced included - guaranteed collateral free  credit support for 26 stressed sectors,  \\`  1.46 lakh crore boost  for Atmanirbhar manufacturing, Production Linked Incentive (PLI)  scheme for sectors such as electronics, textile, telecom, etc. and  additional outlay of  $\\mp\\ 102$   billion towards industrial expenditure,  industrial incentives and development of defence equipment. \nFrom the Government side, trend in capex has also been  encouraging. In FY 2020-21, the Government has spent INR  4.3 trillion on capex, which is a 26.5 per cent y-o-y increase from  FY 2019-20. For the ongoing fiscal year, the Government has  budgeted capex at an 18 year high of 2.5 per cent of GDP. In INR  terms, FY 2021-22 capex is budgeted at INR 5.3 trillion, which  marks an increase of 30.5 per cent from the last year. \nIn fiscal 2020-21, while export demand dipped by 7.2 per cent,  imports shrank 17.6 per cent, reflecting pandemic related  "}

This results  in lower carbon emission not just from operations, but also  from reduced customer travel. We have installed rooftop solar  panels in some of our large offices to supplement grid power  with renewable energy.  \n(Please refer to  Annexure 2  of this report for disclosures  pertaining to CSR as required under the relevant Rules) \nF)  Business Enablers 1)  People Transformation \nIn a year which has seen the worst humanitarian and health  crisis of the century, your Bank has continued to show  buoyant growth and resilience due to the commitment and  tenacity of its people. \nThis year, your Bank, being in the essential services sector,  had to strike a delicate balance between ensuring the  health and safety of its employees while at the same time  ensuring that banking operations continued unhindered.  As an immediate response to the COVID-19 crisis, every  effort was made to transition large sections of the employee  base to ‘Work from home’. However, there were also several  employees who had to continue to attend office physically  as branches and ATMs continued to be functional during the  lockdown. Hence a two-pronged approach was taken viz.  a) Measures to ensure health and safety of employees who  were physically required to attend office and b) Transition  support to new ways of working to those who were working  from home. The focus of the actions has been along three  dimensions: a) Physical well-being, b) Psychological well- being and c) Social well-being. \nThe entire employee awareness and support campaign  under the aegis of #Hum Ha arNa h in Maa neng e’ and ‘HDFC  Bank Cares’. which was initiated during the initial wave of  the pandemic continues to run even now as we battle the  second and more serious wave of the pandemic in India. The  campaign also focused on building employee morale and  resilience during this period of crisis. Your Bank’s internal  communication channel ‘Our World’, which is accessible  to all employees, was leveraged to ensure all relevant  communication reached employees through a single  channel. This was in addition to regular communication  over emails. "}

Your Bank has a distinct credit risk architecture,\npolicies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in\nboth its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is\nmanaged on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast,\nretail lending, given the granularity of individual exposures, is\nmanaged largely on a portfolio basis across various products\nand customer segments. For both categories, there are robust\nfront-end and back-end systems in place to ensure credit quality\nand to minimise loss from default. The factors considered while\nsanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit\nhistory, loan tenor and banking behaviour. In addition, there are\nmultiple credit risk models developed and used to appraise and\nscore different segments of customers on the basis of portfolio\nbehaviour. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping\nexposures on the basis of borrower group, industry, credit rating\ngrades and country, among others. This is backed by portfolio\ndiversification, stringent credit approval processes and periodic\npost-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures.

This is critical in a highly competitive business  environment, especially since it has various lines of  businesses. Ensuring product quality and service delivery  becomes vital for business growth. Your Bank desires  to achieve this by seeking customer feedback as well as  benchmarking with best-in-class business entities. Your  Bank invites and reviews the performance on customer  service as well as grievance redressal at different levels  - Branch Level Customer Service Committees (BLCSCs),  Standing Committee on Customer Service (SCCS) and  Customer Service Committee of the Board (CSCB). \n\nYour Bank has adopted a multi-pronged approach to  provide an omnichannel experience to its customers. On  one side, your Bank has traditional touch points like branch  and phonebanking, and on the other side, it has state- of-the-art platforms like Net Banking, Mobile Banking,  the chatbot Eva offering a wide range of channel choice  to its customers. Your Bank has also improvised on the  relationship based banking programmes. In addition to  the branch based relationship managers, it now has a  Virtual Relationship Manager (VRM) programme to cater  to various financial needs in a personalised manner. Your  Bank has put robust processes in place to regularly monitor  and measure quality of service levels not only at various  touch points but also at a product and process level by  a specialised team called Quality Initiatives Group, which  also works towards implementing strategic initiatives of your  Bank through customer experience management. \nAs part of its continuous efforts to enhance quality of  service, the Service Quality team carries out regular  reviews, including mystery shopping across various  products/processes/channels by following a structured  calendar. Service Quality reviews span across all customer  touch points like Retail Branches, ATM, PhoneBanking,  NetBanking, MobileBanking, Email Services, Relationship  based banking etc, and cover key service parameters like  adherence of stipulated TAT, complaints reduction and  transactions monitoring to ensure meeting the committed  service levels along with process enhancements.  The effectiveness of the quality of service is reviewed  periodically at different levels, including the Customer  Service Committee of the Board. \nYour Bank has provided multiple channels to its customers  to share feedback on its services as well as register their  grievances. It has a Grievance Redressal Policy, duly  approved by its Board, available in the public domain for  ready reference of the customers. Your Bank is at the  forefront of developing innovative financial solutions and  digital platforms. This, coupled with concerted efforts  at creating awareness among customers, has led to  an increase in the use of its digital channels as well as  customer loyalty. Keeping customer interest in focus,  your Bank has formulated a Board approved Customer  Protection Policy, which limits the liability of customers in  case of unauthorised electronic banking transactions. \n\nYour Bank is on a journey to measure customer loyalty  through a high velocity, closed loop customer feedback  system. This customer experience transformation  programme will help employees empathise better with  customers and improve turnaround times. Branded as  ‘Infinite Smiles’, the programme would help establish  behaviours and practices that result in customer-centric  actions through continuous improvements in product,  services, process and policies. \nThanks to these initiatives, your Bank’s customer complaints  for FY 21 decreased by 14.8 per cent to 3,25,786 from  3,82,235 in the previous year. \n4)  Risk Management and Portfolio Quality \nTraditionally, the key risks that your Bank is exposed to  in the course of its business have been the Pillar 1 risks  - Credit Risk, Market Risk and Operational Risk. Given  the evolving banking landscape, Liquidity Risk and Cyber  Security Risk are also vital. These risks not only have a  bearing on your Bank’s financial strength and operations  but also on its reputation. Keeping this in mind, the  Bank has put in place Board-approved risk strategy  and policies, whose implementation is supervised by  the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (RPMC). The  Committee monitors the compliance of risk parameters / aggregate exposures with the appetite set by the Board.  It ensures that frameworks are established for assessing  and managing various risks faced by your Bank, systems  are developed to relate risk to the Bank‘s capital level  and methods are in place for monitoring compliance with  internal risk management policies and processes. It guides  the development of policies, procedures and systems for  managing risks. It ensures that these are adequate and  appropriate to changing business conditions, the structure  and needs of your Bank and its risk appetite. \nThe hallmark of your Bank’s risk management function is  that it is independent of the business sourcing unit with  convergence only at the CEO level. \nThe gamut of key risks faced by the Bank which are  dimensioned and managed include: \nt\u0001\u0001 \\$SFEJU\u00013JTL\u0001JODMVEJOH\u00013FTJEVBM\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 \\$SFEJU\u0001\\$PODFOUSBUJPO\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 \\$PVOUFSQBSUZ\u0001\\$SFEJU\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 .BSLFU\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 0QFSBUJPOBM\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 -JRVJEJUZ\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 \\*OUFSFTU\u00013BUF\u00013JTL\u0001JO\u0001UIF\u0001#BOLJOH\u0001#PPL t\u0001\u0001 \\*OUSBEBZ\u0001-JRVJEJUZ\u00013JTL\u0001BOE\u0001\\*OUSB\u0001%BZ\u0001\\$SFEJU\u00013JTL \nt\u0001\u0001 .PEFM\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 5FDIOPMPHZ\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 0VUTPVSDJOH\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 4USBUFHJD\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 #VTJOFTT\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 \\$PNQMJBODF\u00013JTL t\u0001\u0001 3FQVUBUJPO\u00013JTL \nCredit Risk \nCredit Risk is defined as the possibility of losses associated with  diminution in the credit quality of borrowers or counterparties.  Losses stem from outright default or reduction in portfolio  value. Your Bank has a distinct credit risk architecture,  policies, procedures and systems for managing credit risk in  both its retail and wholesale businesses. Wholesale lending is  managed on an individual as well as portfolio basis. In contrast,  retail lending, given the granularity of individual exposures, is  managed largely on a portfolio basis across various products  and customer segments. For both categories, there are robust  front-end and back-end systems in place to ensure credit quality  and to minimise loss from default. The factors considered while  sanctioning retail loans include income, demographics, credit  history, loan tenor and banking behaviour. In addition, there are  multiple credit risk models developed and used to appraise and  score different segments of customers on the basis of portfolio  behaviour. In wholesale loans, credit risk is managed by capping  exposures on the basis of borrower group, industry, credit rating  grades and country, among others. This is backed by portfolio  diversification, stringent credit approval processes and periodic  post-disbursement monitoring and remedial measures. Your  Bank has been able to ensure strong asset quality through  volatile times in the lending environment by stringently adhering  to prudent norms and institutional is ed processes. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank followed RBI  directions and granted moratorium, loans backed by Government  guaranteed schemes and also carried out one-time restructuring  of the accounts. Your Bank has been prudent and adaptive in  ensuring higher risk standards and proactively reviewing risk  thresholds keeping in mind the COVID-19 pandemic. Further,  your Bank assessed the potential stress impact of the pandemic  on the credit profile of the Bank basis the available information  accompanied with assumptions and judgemental overlay. As  on March 31, 2021, your Bank’s ratio of Gross Non Performing  Assets (GNPAs) to Gross Advances was 1.32 per cent. Net Non- performing Assets (Gross Non-Performing Assets Less Specific  Loan Loss provisions) was 0.40 per cent of Net Advances. \nYour Bank has a conservative and prudent policy for specific  provisions on NPAs. Its provision for NPAs is higher than the  minimum regulatory requirements and adheres to the regulatory  norms for Standard Assets. "}

Digital lending enables\ncustomers to secure loans at the click of a button in a matter of\nminutes, if not seconds. However, there are also attendant risks\nassociated with it and your Bank has put in place appropriate\nchecks and balances to manage these risks. Such loans are\nsanctioned primarily to your Bank’s existing customers. Often,\nthey are customers across multiple products, thus enabling the\nBank ready access to their credit history and risk profile. This\nfacilitates evaluation on their loan eligibility. Besides, most of the\ncredit checks and scores used by your Bank in process-based\nunderwriting are replicated for digital loans. The Bank has an\nindependent model validation unit that minutely assesses the\nmodels used to generate the credit scores for such loans. These\nmodels are monitored, reviewed periodically, back tested and\ncorrective action is taken whenever needed.\n\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk arises largely from your Bank’s statutory reserve\nmanagement and trading activity in interest rates, equity and\ncurrency market. These risks are managed through a well-defined\nBoard approved Market Risk Policy, Investment Policy, Foreign\nExchange Trading Policy and Derivatives Policy that caps risk in\ndifferent trading desks or various securities through trading risk\nlimits/triggers. The risk measures include position limits, tenor\nrestrictions, sensitivity limits, namely, PVO1, Modified Duration\nof Hold to Maturity Portfolio and Option Greeks, Value-at-Risk\n(VaR) Limit, Stop Loss Trigger Level (SLTL), Scenario based P&L\nTriggers, Potential Loss Trigger Level (PLTL), and are monitored on\nan end-of-day basis. In addition, forex open positions, currency\noption delta and interest rate sensitivity limits are computed\nand monitored on an intraday basis. This is supplemented by\na Board-approved stress testing policy and framework that\nsimulates various market risk scenarios to measure losses and\ninitiate remedial measures. The Market Risk capital charge of\nyour Bank is computed on a daily basis using the Standardised\nMeasurement Method applying the regulatory factors.\n\nFurther, owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank evaluated\nthe plausible Mark to Market (MTM) impact on the trading\nportfolio, assuming judgemental scenario shocks, and undertook\nfrequent reviews of trading portfolio for optimised deployment of\nsurplus liquidity within the Bank. It is observed that at the onset\nof the pandemic, most of the asset classes became extremely\nvolatile and the market witnessed significant correction in\nequities, weakening of domestic currency, surge in corporate\nspreads, etc under extreme risk aversion. Subsequently, both\nthe global and Indian markets showed a sharp recovery.\n\nLiquidity Risk\n\nLiquidity Risk is the risk that a bank may not be able to meet its\nshort-term financial obligations due to an asset-liability mismatch\nor interest rate fluctuations.\n\n142\n\nYour Bank’s framework for liquidity and interest rate risk\nmanagement is spelt out in its Asset Liability Management Policy\nthat is implemented, monitored and periodically reviewed by\nthe Asset Liability Committee (ALCO). As part of this process,\nyour Bank has established various Board-approved limits, both\nfor liquidity and interest rate risks. While the maturity gap and\nstock ratio limits help manage liquidity risk, net interest income\nand market value impacts help mitigate interest rate risk. This is\nreinforced by a comprehensive Board-approved stress testing\nprogramme covering both liquidity and interest rate risk. Due\nto the moratorium on loans and advances announced by the\nRBI during the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank has conducted\niquidity stress under an additional stress scenario, assuming\nincremental moratorium availed by customers and the stress\ngaps were within the internal threshold defined.\n\nYour Bank conducts various studies to assess the behavioural\npattern of non-contractual assets and liabilities and embedded\noptions available to customers, which are used while managing\nmaturity gaps. Further, your Bank also has the necessary\nramework in place to manage intraday liquidity risk.\n\nThe Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), a global standard, is also\nused to measure your Bank’s liquidity position. LCR seeks to\nensure that the Bank has an adequate stock of unencumbered\nHigh-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) that can be converted into\ncash easily and immediately to meet its liquidity needs under\na 30-day calendar liquidity stress scenario. While the RBI had\nprovided dispensation to maintain the LCR at 80 per cent until\nSeptember 30, 2020 and at 90 per cent until March 31, 2021\nowing to COVID 19 pandemic, your Bank has consistently\nmaintained the LCR well above 100 per cent. Based on Basel\nIl norms, your Bank’s LCR stood at 137.95 per cent on a\nconsolidated basis for FY 2020-21.\n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio\n\n137.95 per cent\non a consolidated basis for FY 2020-21\n\nThe RBI has also proposed a minimum Net Stable Funding Ratio\n(NSFR) of 100 per cent, which shall be effective from October\n1, 2021. The NSFR seeks to ensure that your Bank maintains a\nstable funding profile in relation to the composition of its assets\nand off-balance sheet activities. As a prudent risk management\npractice, your Bank has been monitoring this ratio, and is thus\nadequately prepared to meet the RBI mandated requirements.\n\nThe accommodative policy stance by the RBI during the pandemic\nhas resulted in the system liquidity at elevated levels. Your Bank\nalso had a comfortable liquidity surplus during the year.\n\nOperational Risk\nThis is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal\nprocesses, people and systems or from external events.\n\nIntroduction to Our How We\nOverview HDFC Bank Performance Create Value\n\nGiven below is a detailed explanation under four different\nheads: Framework and Process, Internal Control, Information\nTechnology and Security Practices and Fraud Monitoring and\nControl.\n\na. Framework and Process\n\nTo manage Operational Risks, your Bank has in place a\ncomprehensive Operational Risk Management Framework,\nwhose implementation is supervised by the Operational\nRisk Management Committee (ORMC) and reviewed by\nhe RPMC of the Board.

Please refer to page 54 for more details.\n\nEnsuring Business Continuity during COVID 19\n\nTeam HDFC Bank rose to the challenge of delivering banking\nservices during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Your\nBank emerged successfully from the nationwide lockdown and\nadopted a hybrid approach of working from home, nearby location\nas well as base location in accordance with pandemic protocols\nhat have been periodically released by the Government.\n\nThis has ensured that we continue to keep the safety of our\nemployees as our first priority. It was realised that the pandemic\nsituation was going to be a long haul. Therefore the teams\nadopted various continuity strategies like split operations, work\nransfer, people transfer and work from home to move from crisis\nmode to business mode and continue delivering services to\ncustomers.\n\n5) Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards\n(IND-AS)\n\nThe Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in its press release dated\nJanuary 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for implementation of\nIndian Accounting Standards (IND-AS) for scheduled commercial\nbanks, insurers/insurance companies and non-banking financial\ncompanies. This roadmap required these institutions to prepare\nND-AS based financial statements for the accounting periods\nbeginning April 1, 2018 with comparatives for the periods\nbeginning April 1, 2017. The RBI, through its circular dated\nFebruary 11, 2016, required all scheduled commercial banks\no0 comply with IND-AS for financial statements for the stated\nperiods. The RBI did not permit banks to adopt IND-AS earlier\nhan the stated timelines. The said guidelines also stated that\nhe RBI shall issue necessary instructions/guidance/clarifications\non the relevant aspects for implementation of IND-AS as and\nwhen required.\n\nThe implementation of IND-AS by banks requires certain\nlegislative changes in the format of financial statements to\n\nIntroduction to Our How We\nOverview HDFC Bank Performance Create Value\n\ncomply with the disclosures required under IND-AS. The change\nin the format requires an amendment to the third schedule of the\nBanking Regulation Act, 1949 to make it compatible with the\npresentation of financial statements under IND-AS. Considering\nhe amendments needed to the Banking Regulation Act, 1949,\nas well as the level of preparedness of several banks, the RBI,\nhrough its Statement on Developmental and Regulatory Policies\ndated April 5, 2018, had deferred the implementation of IND-AS\nby a year by when the necessary legislative anendments were\nexpected. The legislative amendments recommended by the RBI\nare under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly,\nhe RBI, through its circular dated March 22, 2019, deferred the\nimplementation of IND-AS until further notice.\n\nThe implementation of IND-AS is expected to result in significant\nhanges to the way your Bank prepares and presents its financial\natements. The areas that are expected to have significant\niccounting impact on the application of IND-AS are summarised\nlow:\n\nTM2ROA\n\n=\n\n) Financial assets (which include advances and investments)\nshall be classified under amortised cost, fair value through other\ncomprehensive income (a component of reserves and surplus) or\nair value through profit/loss categories on the basis of the nature\nof the cash flows and the intention of holding the financial assets.\n\n2) Interest will be recognised in the income statement using the\neffective interest rate method, where the coupon, fees net of\nransaction costs and all other premiums or discounts will be\namortised over the life of the financial instrument.\n\n3) Stock options will be required to be fair valued on the date\nof grant and be recognised as staff expenses in the income\nstatement over the vesting period of the stock options.\n\n4) The impairment requirements of IND-AS 109, Financial\nnstruments, are based on an Expected Credit Loss (ECL)\nmodel that replaces the incurred loss model under the extant\nramework. Your Bank will generally be required to recognise\neither a 12-month or lifetime ECL, depending upon whether\nhere has been a significant increase in credit risk since\ninitial recognition. IND-AS 109 will change the Bank’s current\nmethodology for calculating the provision for standard assets\nand NPAs. Your Bank will be required to apply a three-stage\napproach to measure ECL on financial instruments accounted\njor at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive\nincome. Financial assets will migrate through the following\nhree stages based on the changes in credit quality since initial\nrecognition:\n\nStage 1: 12-Month ECL\n\nFor exposures which have not been assessed as credit-impaired\nor where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk\nsince initial recognition, the portion of the ECL associated with\nhe probability of default events occurring within the next 12\nmonths will need to be recognised.\n\nResponsible\nOur Strategy Business\n\nStatutory Reports and\nFinancial Statements\n\nStage 2: Lifetime ECL - not Credit impaired\n\nFor credit exposures where there has been a significant increase\nin credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit-impaired,\na lifetime ECL will need to be recognised.\n\nStage 3: Lifetime ECL - Credit impaired\nFinancial assets will be assessed as credit impaired when one\nor more events having a detrimental impact on the estimated\nure cash flows of that asset have occurred. For financial assets\nat have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL will need to be\nrecognised.\n\nSc\n\nnterest revenue will be recognised at the original effective\ninterest rate applied on the gross carrying amount for assets\nalling under stages 1 and 2 and on written down amount for the\nassets falling under stage 3.\n\n5) Accounting impact on the application of IND-AS at the transition\ndate shall be recognised in equity (reserves and surplus).\n\nYour Bank, being an associate of Housing Development Finance\nCorporation Limited (the ‘Corporation’), is required to submit\nits consolidated financial information (‘fit-for-consolidation\ninformation’), prepared in accordance with the recognition and\nmeasurement principles of IND-AS as specified under Section\n133 of the Companies Act, 2013, to the Corporation for the\npurposes of the consolidated financial statements/results of the\nCorporation. The results of the Bank upon its first-time adoption\nof and transition to IND-AS, based on the updated regulations\nand accounting standards/guidance and business strategy at\nhe date of actual transition, could differ from those reported in\nhe fit-for-consolidation information.\n\n6) Internal Controls, Audit and Compliance\nYour Bank has put in place extensive internal controls and\nprocesses to mitigate Operational Risks, including centralised\noperations and ‘segregation of duty’ between the front office\nand back office. The front-office units usually act as customer\n‘ouch-points and sales and service outlets while the back-office\ncarries out the entire processing, accounting and settlement\nof transactions in the Bank’s core banking system. The policy\nramework, definition and monitoring of limits is carried out by\nvarious mid-office and risk management functions. The credit\nsanctioning and debt management units are also segregated\nand do not have any sales and operations responsibilities.\n\nYour Bank has set up various executive-level committees, with\nparticipation from various business and control functions, that\nare designed to review and oversee matters pertaining to capital,\nassets and liabilities, business practices and customer service,\nOperational Risk, information security, business continuity\nplanning and internal risk-based supervision among others.\nThe control functions set standards and lay down policies and\nprocedures by which the business functions manage risks,\nincluding compliance with applicable laws, compliance with\nregulatory guidelines, adherence to operational controls and\n\nHDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21 145\n", "vlm_text": "Directors’ Report \nCyber Security and Data Risk \nYour Bank has robust cyber security measures in place.  For  details please refer page 53.   \nICAAP \nYour Bank has a structured management framework in the  Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) to  identify, assess and manage all risks that may have a material  adverse impact on its business/financial position/capital  adequacy. The ICAAP framework is guided by the Board- approved ICAAP Policy. \nStress Testing Framework \nYour Bank has implemented a Board approved Stress Testing  Policy and Framework which forms an integral part of the Bank’s  ICAAP. Stress testing involves the use of various techniques  to assess your Bank’s potential vulnerability to extreme but  plausible stressed business conditions. The changes in the  levels of Pillar I risks and select Pillar II risks, along with the  changes in the on and off balance sheet positions of your Bank  are assessed under assumed ‘stress’ scenarios and sensitivity  factors. Typically, these relate, inter alia, to the impact on your  Bank’s profitability and capital adequacy. \nIn the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, your Bank developed  a topical stress scenario to assess the impact of COVID-19  stress on Credit Risk, Market Risk and Liquidity Risk. The  COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been unprecedented, uncertain  and continuously evolving. Thus the underlying assumptions  and building blocks of the stress methodology get modified  depending upon how the pandemic evolves domestically and  globally. The stress results from this framework are deployed to  ascertain the capital consumption under Pillar II risks as well as  the overall impact on the capital adequacy of your Bank. \nThe COVID-19 pandemic crisis has been  unprecedented, uncertain and continuously  evolving. Thus the underlying assumptions  and building blocks of the stress  methodology get modified depending upon  how the pandemic evolves domestically and  globally. \nGroup Risk \nYour Bank has two subsidiaries, HDB Financial Services Limited  and HDFC Securities Limited. The Board of each subsidiary is  responsible for managing their respective material risks (Credit  Risk, Market Risk, Operational Risk, Liquidity Risk, Technology  Risk, Reputation Risk, Compliance Risk and others). The Group  Risk Management Committee (GRMC) was instituted in your  Bank under the ICAAP framework to establish a formal and  dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature/quantum  of material risks of the subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk  management processes. Stress testing for the group as a whole  is carried out by integrating the stress tests of the subsidiaries.  Similarly, capital adequacy projections are formulated for the  group after incorporating the business/capital plans of the  subsidiaries. \n\nBusiness Continuity Planning (BCP) \nYour Bank has an ISO 22301 certified Business Continuity Plan  (BCP) in place to minimise service disruptions and potential  impact on its business, employees and customers during  any unforeseen adverse event or circumstances. The central  Business Continuity Office works towards strengthening the  continuity preparedness. The plan is designed in accordance  with the regulatory guidelines and is reviewed regularly. The  implementation is overseen by the Information Security Group  and the Business Continuity Steering Committee which is chaired  by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). The Business Continuity Policy  and Procedure defines roles for Crisis Management, Business  Recovery, Emergency Response and IT Disaster Recovery  Planning teams.

While the country\nhad barely come out of the first wave, the more dangerous\nsecond wave struck posing fresh challenges for the global and\nthe Indian economy. The presence of the vaccine is a clear\nsource of comfort but there are challenges around its supply. The\nproactive measures taken by the Union Government like allowing\nimports is expected to ease the situation. As is the decision to go\nin for a centralised vaccination procurement and free distribution\nof vaccines to everyone above the age of 18.\n\nNotwithstanding these challenges the Indian economy is\nexpected to be among the fastest growing ones in the world.\nPerhaps not as fast as projected earlier. The Union Government's\ndecision to put growth ahead of fiscal consolidation is another\npositive.\n\nYour Bank of course cannot remain entirely unaffected by these\ndevelopments. It has certain factors in its favour : A strong\nbalance sheet with among the lowest NPA levels in the industry,\na franchise that inspires trust and capitalisation levels that\nexceed regulatory norms. This means it can continue lending\nas well as innovate. While there have challenges when it comes\n‘0 technology, your Bank has initiated both short term as well as\nlong term measures to overcome these.\n\nThe biggest opportunity is of course the under penetration of\nbanking services in the country. Changing global dynamics\nmeans that countries are increasingly trying to diversify and do\nnot want want to put all their eggs in the China basket. India is\nwell positioned to capitalise on this opportunity. Your Bank is also\nexpected to benefit from these developments.\n\nIt will however not abandon the core principles of its journey of\nover a quarter century.

The risk of identification  of NPAs is affected by factors like stress and liquidity concerns in  certain sectors.  \nEvaluated the governance process and review controls over  calculations of provision of non-performing advances, basis of  provisioning in accordance with the Board approved policy. \nSelected the borrowers based on quantitative and qualitative risk  factors for their assessment of appropriate classification as NPA  including computation of overdue ageing to assess its correct  classification and provision amount as per extant IRAC norms and  the Bank policy.  \nThe provision on NPA is estimated based on ageing and classification  of NPAs, recovery estimates, nature of loan product, value of  security and other qualitative factors and is subject to the minimum  provisioning norms specified by RBI and approved policy of the Bank  in this regard.  \nPerformed other substantive procedures included and not limited to  the following: \n• Selected samples of performing loans and assessed independently  as to whether those should be classified as NPA; • For samples selected reviewed the collateral valuation, financial  statements and other qualitative information; • Considered the accounts reported by the Bank and other Banks as  Special Mention Accounts (“SMA”) in RBI’s Central Repository of  Information on Large Credits (CRILC) to identify stress; • For selected samples assessed independently accounts that can  potentially be classified as NPA and Red Flagged Accounts; • Performed inquiries with the credit and risk departments to  ascertain if there were indicators of stress or an occurrence of an  event of default in a particular loan account or any product category  which needed to be considered as NPA; • Examined the early warning reports generated by the Bank to  identify stressed loan accounts;  • Held specific discussions with the management of the Bank on  sectors where there is perceived credit risk and the steps taken to  mitigate the risks to identified sectors; • Selected samples for standard accounts, default but standard  accounts and overdue accounts and assessed compliance with  RBI circular on COVID-19 Regulatory Package; • Selected and tested samples of accounts which were restructured  under MSME restructuring circular and Resolution Framework for  COVID-19 related stress circular for their compliance with the RBI  directions; and • Selected samples of accounts which were not declared as NPA  due to the interim order of Honourable Supreme Court and later  on due to the vacation of the interim order and the RBI circular  in that connection to ensure the asset classification of borrower  accounts has been continued as per the extant RBI instructions /  IRAC norms.

These are classiﬁed as contingency provisions. \nThe management of the Bank also made an assessment of the impact  on borrowers’ account due to COVID-19 pandemic and in line with  the COVID-19 Regulatory Package announced by the RBI in respect  of moratorium and restructuring of advances as relief measures to  the borrowers.  \nAdditionally, the Bank has considered the impact of judegment, on  identification of NPA and provision thereof, which was vacated as per  Honourable Supreme Court Order on March 23, 2021 and the RBI  circular dated April 7, 2021 in that connection. \nSince the identification of NPAs and provisioning for advances  require significant level of estimation and given its significance to  the overall audit including possible observation by RBI which could  result into disclosure in the financial statements, we have ascertained  identification and provisioning for NPAs as a key audit matter. \nThe table compares the amounts associated with \"Taxes\" and \"Legal Cases\" for two different dates: March 31, 2021, and March 31, 2020. \n\n- As of March 31, 2021:\n  - Taxes amount to ₹1,268 Crores.\n  - Legal Cases amount to ₹228 Crores.\n\n- As of March 31, 2020:\n  - Taxes amount to ₹1,292 Crores.\n  - Legal Cases amount to ₹92 Crores.\n\nThe data shows that, from March 31, 2020, to March 31, 2021, the amount related to Taxes decreased by ₹24 Crores while the amount related to Legal Cases increased by ₹136 Crores.\nKey Audit Matter \nHow our audit addressed the key audit matter \nThe Bank has material open tax litigations including matters under  dispute which involve significant judgement to determine the  possible outcome of these disputes. \nOur Audit procedures with respect to this matter included: \ncontrols over the estimation, monitoring and disclosure of provisions  and contingent liabilities. Our substantive audit procedures included and were not limited to  the following:  • Obtained an understanding of the Bank’s process for determining  tax liabilities, tax provisions and contingent liabilities pertaining to  legal matters and taxation matters; • Obtained list of cases / matters in respect of which litigations were  outstanding as at reporting date;   $\\succcurlyeq$   For significant legal matters, we sought external confirmations  and also corroborated with management’s documented  conclusions on the assessment of outstanding litigations  against the Bank; Ø  For significant taxation matters, we involved our tax specialist  to gain an understanding of the current status of the litigations,  including understanding of various orders / notices received by  the Bank and the management’s grounds of appeals before the  relevant appellate authorities. • Evaluated the merit of the subject matter under consideration  with reference to the grounds presented therein and available  independent legal / tax advice; and • Agreed underlying tax balances to supporting documentation,  including correspondence with tax authorities. Assessed the disclosures within the standalone financial statements  in this regard. \nSignificant management judgement is needed in determining whether  an obligation exists and whether a provision should be recognised as  at the reporting date, in accordance with the accounting criteria set  under Accounting Standard 29 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities  and Contingent Assets (‘AS 29’), or whether it needs to be disclosed  as a contingent liability. Further significant judgements are also  involved in measuring such obligations, the most significant of which  are:\n\n \n• Assessment of liability: Judgement is involved in the determination  of whether an outflow in respect of identified material matters are  probable and can be estimated reliably;\n\n \n• Adequacy of provisions: The appropriateness of assumptions and  judgements used in the estimation of significant provisions; and \nThe Bank’s assessment is supported by the facts of matter, their own  judgement, experience, and advises from legal and independent tax  consultants wherever considered necessary.  \nSince the assessment of these open litigations requires significant  level of judgement in interpretation of law, we have included this as  a key audit matter.

Reasonable\nassurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect\na material misstatement when it exists.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention\nin our Auditor's Report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify\nour opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our Auditor’s Report.

The assets and their respective useful lives are as follows:\n\n1. **Owned Premises**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 61 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 60 years\n\n2. **Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 10 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 15 years\n\n3. **Electrical Equipment and Installations**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 6 to 10 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 10 years\n\n4. **Office Equipment**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 3 to 6 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 5 years\n\n5. **Computers**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 3 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 3 years\n\n6. **Modems, Routers, Switches, Servers, Network, and Related IT Equipment**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 3 to 6 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 6 years\n\n7. **Motor Cars**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 4 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 8 years\n\n8. **Furniture and Fittings**:\n   - Assessed by the Bank: 16 years\n   - Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 10 years\nt\u0001 \\*NQSPWFNFOUT\u0001UP\u0001MFBTF\u0001IPME\u0001QSFNJTFT\u0001BSF\u0001DIBSHFE\u0001PGG\u0001 over the remaining primary period of lease. t\u0001 4PGUXBSF\u0001BOE\u0001TZTUFN\u0001EFWFMPQNFOU\u0001FYQFOEJUVSF\u0001JT\u0001 depreciated over a period of 5 years. t\u0001 1PJOU\u0001PG\u0001TBMFT\u0001UFSNJOBMT\u0001BSF\u0001EFQSFDJBUFE\u0001PWFS\u0001B\u0001QFSJPE\u0001 of 4 years. t\u0001 'PS\u0001 BTTFUT\u0001 QVSDIBTFE\u0001 BOE\u0001 TPME\u0001 EVSJOH\u0001 UIF\u0001 ZFBS\r\u0001 depreciation is provided on pro-rata basis by the  Bank. t\u0001 8IFOFWFS\u0001UIFSF\u0001JT\u0001B\u0001SFWJTJPO\u0001PG\u0001UIF\u0001FTUJNBUFE\u0001VTFGVM\u0001 life of an asset, the unamortised depreciable amount  is charged over the revised remaining useful life of the  said asset. t\u0001 1SPýU\u0001PO\u0001TBMF\u0001PG\u0001JNNPWBCMF\u0001QSPQFSUZ\u0001OFU\u0001PG\u0001UBYFT\u0001BOE\u0001 transfer to statutory reserve, are transferred to capital  reserve account. t\u0001 \"TTFUT\u0001\tPUIFS\u0001UIBO\u0001104\u0001UFSNJOBMT\n\u0001DPTUJOH\u0001MFTT\u0001UIBO\u0001  $\\gtrsim5{,}000$   individually, are fully depreciated in the year  of purchase. \n6  Impairment of assets \nThe Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether  there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.  Impairment loss, if any, is provided in the Profit and Loss  Account to the extent the carrying amount of assets  exceeds their estimated recoverable amount. \n7  Translation of foreign currency items \nForeign currency income and expenditure items of domestic  operations are translated at the exchange rates prevailing  on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure  items of integral foreign operations (representative offices)  \nare translated at the weekly average closing rates and  of non-integral foreign operations (foreign branches and  offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing  rates. \nForeign currency monetary items of domestic and integral  foreign operations are translated at the closing exchange  rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association  of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet date and the  resulting net revaluation profit or loss arising due to a net  open position in any foreign currency is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account. \nBoth monetary and non-monetary foreign currency  assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations are  translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI at  the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss arising  from exchange differences are accumulated in the Foreign  Currency Translation Account until disposal of the non- integral foreign operations in accordance with AS-11, The  Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates and the  extant RBI guidelines.  \nForeign currency denominated contingent liabilities on  account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts,  guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and  endorsements are reported at closing rates of exchange  notified by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date. \n8  Foreign exchange and derivative contracts \nForeign exchange spot and forward contracts outstanding  as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are  revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively  as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts  of interim maturities. The USD-INR rate for valuation of  contracts having longer maturities i.e. greater than one  year, is derived using the MIFOR and LIBOR curves. For  other currency pairs, the forward points (for rates / tenors  not published by FEDAI) are obtained from Refinitiv or  Bloomberg for valuation of the forex deals. Valuation is  considered on present value basis, as directed by FEDAI.  For this purpose, the forward profit or loss on the deals  are discounted till the valuation date using the discounting  yields. The resulting profit or loss on valuation is recognised  in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange contracts  are classified as assets when the fair value is positive  (positive marked to market value) or as liabilities when the  fair value is negative (negative marked to market value). \nForeign exchange forward contracts not intended for  trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of  reporting currency required or available at the settlement  date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance  Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate.  The premium or discount arising at the inception of such  forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or  income over the life of the contract.  \n\nThe Bank recognises all derivative contracts (other than  those designated as hedges) at fair value, on the date on  which the derivative contracts are entered into and are re- measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet or reporting  dates. Derivatives are classified as assets when the fair  value is positive (positive marked to market value) or as  liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked  to market value). Changes in the fair value of derivatives  other than those designated as hedges are recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account. \nDerivative contracts designated as hedges are not marked  to market unless their underlying transaction is marked to  market. In respect of derivative contracts that are marked  to market, changes in the market value are recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account in the relevant period. The  Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the  inception of the transaction itself. Hedge effectiveness is  ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and  periodically thereafter. Gains or losses arising from hedge  ineffectiveness, if any, are recognised in the Profit and Loss  Account. \n9  Revenue recognition \nInterest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss  Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of non- performing assets. Also in case of domestic advances,  where interest is collected on rear end basis, such interest  is accounted on receipt basis in accordance with the RBI  communication.  \nInterest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought  out through the direct assignment route is recognised at  their effective interest rate. \nIncome on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is  recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant  effective yield basis. \nLoan processing fee is recognised as income when due.  Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when  a significant act / milestone is completed. \nGain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with  the extant RBI guidelines. \nDividend on equity shares, preference shares and on  mutual fund units is recognised as income when the right  to receive the dividend is established. \nGuarantee commission, commission on letter of credit,  annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards  are recognised on a straight-line basis over the period  "}

Where a breach is observed in such a simulation, the customer is advised to reduce its unhedged exposure. \nIn accordance with RBI guidelines, as at March 31, 2021 the Bank holds standard asset provisions of  \\`  230.31 crore (previous  year:  \\`  129.95 crore) and maintains capital (including CCB & D-SIB) of  \\`  918.77 crore (previous year:  \\`  574.13 crore) in respect  of the unhedged foreign currency exposure of its customers. \nThe table presents financial data related to the \"Value of investments\" categorized into three main sections: Gross value of investments, Provisions for depreciation on investments, and Net value of investments.

Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the\nhedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or\ncash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows\nof the hedging instrument.\n\nThe hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument\nmay be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. Derivative contracts designated as hedges\nin an effective hedge relationship, are not marked to market unless their underlying asset or liability is marked to market.\nn respect of derivative contracts that are marked to market, changes in the market value are recognised in the Profit\nand Loss Account in the relevant period. Gain or losses arising from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recognised in the\nProfit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish\nhe amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the\nBalance Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such\nforward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract.\n\nProvisioning, collateral and credit risk mitigation\nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions with counter parties based on their business ranking and financial position.\n\nThe Bank sets up appropriate limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in the event\nof crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events to call for\ncollaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk.\n\nThe Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue receivables\nrepresenting crystallised positive mark-to-market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the\nborrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full provision is made for the\nentire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing derivative\ncontracts.\n\nQuantitative disclosure on risk exposure in derivatives (® crore)\nMa Particulars Currency derivatives Interest rate derivatives\nMarch 31, March 31, March 31, March 31,\n2021 2020 2021 2020\n1 Derivatives (notional principal amount)\na) Hedging - - - -\nb) Trading 40,074.83 48,556.58 317,629.80 364,449.58\n2 Marked to market positions.\na) Asset (+) 922.74 1,469.15 3,253.93 4,994.01\nb) Liability (-) (594.51) (1,090.17) (3,395.30) (6,197.06)\n3 Credit exposure 3,077.28 3,562.03 5,423.27 6,734.23\n4 Likely impact of one percentage change in interest rate\n(100*PVo1)**\na) On hedging derivatives - - - -\nb) On trading derivatives 32.08 45.10 187.97 70.94\n5 Maximum of 100*PV01 observed during the year**\na) On hedging - - - -\nb) On trading 43.07 45.10 187.97 181.04\n\n6 = Minimum of 100*PVO1 observed during the year**\na) On hedging - - - -\nb) On trading 18.83 32.39 0.34 44.41\n*“Amounts given are absolute values on a net basis, excluding currency options.\n\nHDFC Bank Limited | Integrated Annual Report 2020-21 225\n", "vlm_text": "Schedules to the Financial Statements For the year ended March 31, 2021  \nInterest rate caps and floors give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest.

Classification of the derivative book is made on the basis  of the definitions of the trading and hedging books specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is managed within  the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors. \nHedging policy \nFor derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the relationship  between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge and  the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the  hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes in the fair value or  cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows  of the hedging instrument. \nThe hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging instrument  may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. Derivative contracts designated as hedges  in an effective hedge relationship, are not marked to market unless their underlying asset or liability is marked to market.  In respect of derivative contracts that are marked to market, changes in the market value are recognised in the Profit  and Loss Account in the relevant period. Gain or losses arising from hedge ineffectiveness, if any, is recognised in the  Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts not intended for trading, that are entered into to establish  the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the  Balance Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate. The premia or discount arising at the inception of such  forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or income over the life of the contract. \n1SPWJTJPOJOH\r\u0001DPMMBUFSBM\u0001BOE\u0001DSFEJU\u0001SJTL\u0001NJUJHBUJPO \nThe Bank enters into derivative transactions with counter parties based on their business ranking and financial position. \n The Bank sets up appropriate limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour its obligations in the event  of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where required, as trigger events to call for  collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. \nThe Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue receivables  representing crystallised positive mark-to-market value of a derivative contract are transferred to the account of the  borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full provision is made for the  entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of non-performing derivative  contracts. \nThe table provides a financial analysis of derivatives, split into currency derivatives and interest rate derivatives, covering two fiscal years: ending March 31, 2021, and March 31, 2020. The table includes several key metrics:\n\n1. **Derivatives (notional principal amount):** \n   - For currency and interest rate derivatives, split into hedging and trading activities.\n   - Data show amounts in large units (likely millions).\n\n2. **Marked to market positions:**\n   - Categorizes values into assets and liabilities indicating their values at market rates.\n\n3. **Credit exposure:**\n   - Reflects the exposure or risk associated with the creditworthiness of derivative counterparties.\n\n4. **Likely impact of one percentage change in interest rate (100*PV01):**\n   - Shows potential impacts on hedging and trading derivatives with respect to a 1% interest rate change.\n\n5. **Maximum of 100*PV01 observed during the year:**\n   - Captures the maximum sensitivity observed for the year on hedging and trading activities.\n\n6. **Minimum of 100*PV01 observed during the year:**\n   - Provides the minimum sensitivity during the year for hedging and trading activities.\n\nOverall, the table is useful for assessing the financial health and risk management of an organization dealing with currency and interest rate derivatives."}

These classifications, based\non extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI.\n\nThe LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period.

Other contractual funding, including a portion of other  liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30 day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These classifications, based  on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also submitted to the RBI. \nThe LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period. The  guidelines for LCR were effective January 1, 2015, with the minimum requirement at  $60\\%$   which would rise in equal annual  steps to reach  $100\\%$   on January 1,  $^{2019}$  . This graduated approach was designed to ensure that the LCR could be introduced  without material disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity. The  present requirement, as on March 31, 2021 is  $90\\%$   (As a measure to address the current pandemic situation, RBI had reduced  the minimum LCR requirement from   $100\\%$   to  $80\\%$   which is to be gradually restored back in two phases, i.e.,  $90\\%$   by October  1, 2020 and   $100\\%$   by April 1, 2021) \nIn the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various categories of liabilities  (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments, derivative-related exposures, and  offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period. Given below is a table of run-off factors and  the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past two years: \nThe table displays two columns labeled \"Particulars\" and \"Run-off factors.\" Under \"Particulars,\" it lists different categories of entities or deposit types. Corresponding to each particular, the \"Run-off factors\" column shows the percentage range or value of run-off factors associated with these entities or deposits. \n\nThe details are as follows:\n- Retail Deposits have a run-off factor range of 5% - 10%.\n- Small Business Customers also have a run-off factor range of 5% - 10%.\n- Operational deposits have a run-off factor range of 5% - 25%.\n- Non-financial corporates, sovereigns, central banks, multilateral development banks, and PSEs (Public Sector Entities) have a run-off factor of 40%.\n- Other legal entities have a run-off factor of 100%.\nThe table displays information about the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) over different quarters. It includes the following columns:\n\n1. **Quarter ended**: Lists the specific dates for the end of each quarter from June 30, 2019, to March 31, 2021.\n   \n2. **LCR Maintained (Average)**: Shows the average LCR maintained for each quarter, with values ranging from 125.07% to 152.43%.\n\n3. **LCR Required**: Indicates the LCR requirement for each quarter, which varies between 80.00% and 100.00%.\nThe average LCR for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 was at   $137.24\\%$   as against   $132.20\\%$   for the quarter ended March  31, 2020, and well above the present prescribed minimum requirement of  $90\\%$  . The average   $\\mathsf{H Q L A}$   for the quarter ended  March 31, 2021 was  \\`  387,444.92 crore, as against was  $\\gtrsim281{,}400{.}84$   crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. During the  same period the composition of government securities and treasury bills in the HQLA was at  $89.49\\%$   as compared to  $91\\%$  in the previous year. \nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2021, derivative exposures (net of cash inflows) / collateral requirements and undrawn  commitments constituted just about  $0.25\\%$   and  $2.45\\%$   respectively of average cash outflow. The Bank has consistently  maintained a robust funding profile with a significant portion of funding through deposits. As of March 31, 2021 the top 20  depositors comprised of   $4\\%$   of total deposits indicating a healthy and stable deposit profile. \n29.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic,  including the current “second wave” that has significantly increased the number of cases in India, will continue to impact the  Bank’s results will depend on ongoing as well as future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other  things, any new information concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate  its impact whether government-mandated or elected by us. \nIn accordance with the COVID-19 Regulatory Packages announced by the RBI on March 27, 2020, April 17, 2020 and May 23,  2020, the Bank, in accordance with its board approved policy, offered a moratorium on the repayment of all instalments and  / or interest, as applicable, due between March 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 to all eligible borrowers classified as standard,  even if overdue, as on February 29, 2020. In respect of such accounts that were granted moratorium, the asset classification  remained standstill during the moratorium period. \nThe disclosures as required by the RBI circular dated April 17, 2020 are given below:  \nThe table displays financial data with specific categories and corresponding amounts in crore:\n\n1. **Respective amounts in SMA/overdue categories**: \n   - Term Loan Instalments: ₹11,805.09 crore\n   - Cash Credit/Overdraft: ₹4,063.48 crore\n   - Total: ₹15,868.57 crore\n\n2. **Respective amount where asset classification benefit is extended**:\n   - Term Loan Instalments: ₹3,918.08 crore\n   - Cash Credit/Overdraft: ₹1,527.22 crore\n   - Total: ₹5,445.30 crore\n\n3. **Provisions made in terms of paragraph 5 of the circular**: ₹620.00 crore\n\n4. **Provisions adjusted against slippages in terms of paragraph 6 of the circular**: None\n\n5. **Residual provisions as of March 31, 2021, in terms of paragraph 6 of the circular**: ₹620.00 crore\n\nNote: An asterisk indicates a note related to March 31, 2021, for the accounts mentioned.\n44. Refund / adjustment of ‘interest on interest’ \nIn accordance with the instructions in the paragraph 5 of the RBI circular dated April 07, 2021, the Bank shall refund / adjust  ‘interest on interest’ to all borrowers including those who had availed of working capital facilities during the moratorium  period, irrespective of whether moratorium had been fully or partially availed, or not availed. Pursuant to these instructions,  the methodology for calculation of the amount of such ‘interest on interest’ would be finalised by the Indian Banks Association  (IBA) in consultation with other industry participants / bodies and is awaited as on the date of approval of financial statements.  The Bank has however estimated the said amount and recognised a charge of   $\\gtrless470.00$   crore in its Profit and Loss Account  for the year ended March 31, 2021. \n45.

Restructuring of an account is done at a borrower level.  \nIn accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential  framework for resolution of stressed assets and the  resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress, the Bank  in accordance with its Board approved policy, carried out  one-time restructuring of eligible borrowers. The asset  classification and necessary provisions thereon are done  in accordance with the said RBI guidelines. \nHDB Financial Services Limited Classification: \nReceivables under financing activity are classified as  standard, sub-standard and doubtful assets as per the  Company policy approved by the Board and as per RBI  guidelines. The rates applied for making provisions on non- performing assets (NPA) are higher than those required  by the relevant RBI guidelines. Interest on non-performing  assets is transferred to an interest suspense account and  not recognised in the Profit and Loss Account until received.  Receivables under financing activity are recognised on  disbursement of loan and in case of new asset financing  on the transfer of ownership. \nProvisioning: \nThe Company assesses all receivables for their recoverability  and accordingly recognises provision for non-performing  and doubtful assets as per approved Company policies and  guidelines. The Company ensures provisions made are not  lower than as stipulated by RBI guidelines. \nThe Company provides   $0.40\\%$   on standard assets as  stipulated by RBI guidelines. \nLoan origination costs: \nBrokerage, commission, incentive to employee etc. paid at  the time of acquisition of loans are charged to expenses. \n3  Securitisation and transfer of assets   HDFC Bank Limited \nAssets transferred through securitisation and direct  assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance  Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met  with) and consideration is received by the Bank. Sales /  transfers that do not meet these criteria for surrender of  control are accounted for as borrowings. In accordance  with RBI guidelines, the Bank amortises any profit received  for a securitisation or direct assignment transaction based  on the method prescribed and any loss arising therefrom  is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account at the time of  sale. \nThe Bank transfers advances through inter-bank  participation with and without risk. In accordance with  the RBI guidelines, in the case of participation with risk,  the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the  Bank is reduced from advances and where the Bank is  participating, the aggregate amount of the participation  is classified under advances. In the case of participation  without risk, the aggregate amount of participation issued  by the Bank is classified under borrowings and where the  Bank is participating, the aggregate amount of participation  is shown as due from banks under advances. \nIn accordance with RBI guidelines on sale of non- performing advances, if the sale is at a price below the  net book value (i.e., book value less provisions held), the  shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account and if  the sale is for a value higher than the net book value, the  excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account  in the year the amounts are received. \nIn respect of stressed assets sold by the Bank under an  asset securitisation, where the investment by the bank in  security receipts (SRs) backed by the assets sold by it is  more than 10 percent of such SRs, in accordance with  RBI guidelines, provisions held are higher of the provisions  required in terms of net asset value declared by the  Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company  (‘RC’) and provisions as per the extant norms applicable to  the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of  these SRs as the corresponding stressed loans assuming  the loans remained in the books of the Bank.  \nThe Bank invests in Pass Through Certificates (PTCs)  issued by other Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These  are accounted for at the deal value and are classified as  investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct  assignment route which are classified as advances. These  are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the  face value, in which case the premium is amortised over  the tenor of the loans. \nHDB Financial Services Limited \n1SJPS\u0001UP\u0001\\*TTVBODF\u0001PG\u00013#\\*\u0001\\$JSDVMBS\u0001EBUFE\u0001\"VHVTU\u0001\u0013\u0012\r\u0001\u0013\u0011\u0012\u0013 a)  On receivables being assigned / securtised, the  assets are de-recognised as all the rights, title,  future receivables & interest thereof are assigned  to the purchaser. \nb)  Gains arising on assignment of receivables will be  recognised at the end of the tenure of assignment  contract as per the RBI guidelines, while loss, if  any is recognised upfront. \n1PTU\u0001\\*TTVBODF\u0001PG\u00013#\\*\u0001\\$JSDVMBS\u0001EBUFE\u0001\"VHVTU\u0001\u0013\u0012\r\u0001\u0013\u0011\u0012\u0013 a)  Securitised receivables are de-recognised in the  Balance Sheet when they are sold i.e. they meet  true sale criteria. \nb)  Gains arising out of securitisation of assets are  recognised over the tenure of the securities  issued by Special Purpose Vehicle Trust (SPV). \nc)  The excess interest spread on the securitisation  transactions are recognised in the Profit and Loss  Account only when it is redeemed in cash by the  SPV after adjusting for overdue receivable for  more than 90 days. Losses, if any, are recognised  upfront. \n4. Priority  Sector  Lending  Certificates  (PSLCs) \nThe Bank enters into transactions for the sale or purchase  of Priority Sector Lending Certificates (PSLCs). In the case  of a sale transaction, the Bank sells the fulfilment of priority  sector obligation and in the case of a purchase transaction  the Bank buys the fulfilment of priority sector obligation  through RBI trading platform. There is no transfer of risks  or loan assets. The fee received for the sale of PSLCs is  recorded as miscellaneous income and the fee paid for  purchase of the PSLCs is recorded as other expenditure  in Profit and Loss Account. These are amortised over the  period of the Certificate. \nFixed assets and depreciation HDFC Bank Limited \nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated  depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost  includes cost of purchase and all expenditure like site  preparation, installation costs and professional fees  incurred on the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent  expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only  when it increases the future benefit / functioning capability  from / of such assets.  \nDepreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of  the fixed asset on a straight-line basis. The management  believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the Bank,  pursuant to Part C of Schedule II to the Companies Act,  2013, taking into account changes in environment, changes  in technology, the utility and efficacy of the asset in use,  fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets.  The estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are given  below:  \nThe table provides a comparison of the estimated useful life of different types of assets as assessed by a bank versus the estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013. Here is a breakdown of the information from the table:\n\n1. **Owned Premises**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 61 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 60 years\n\n2. **Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 10 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 15 years\n\n3. **Electrical Equipment and Installations**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 6 to 10 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 10 years\n\n4. **Office Equipment**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 3 to 6 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 5 years\n\n5. **Computers**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 3 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 3 years\n\n6. **Modems, Routers, Switches, Servers, Networks, and Related IT Equipment**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 3 to 6 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 6 years\n\n7. **Motor Cars**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 4 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 8 years\n\n8. **Furniture and Fittings**:\n   - Estimated useful life as assessed by the Bank: 16 years\n   - Estimated useful life specified under Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013: 10 years\n\nThe table essentially shows the discrepancies or alignments between the bank's assessment of asset lifespan and the lifespans specified by the regulatory framework."}

Exchange differences, if any arising out of transactions  settled during the year are recognized in the Profit and  Loss Account. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated  in foreign currencies as at the Balance Sheet date are  translated at the closing exchange rate on that date. The  exchange differences, if any, are recognised in the Profit  and Loss Account and related assets and liabilities are  accordingly restated in the Balance Sheet. \n7  Foreign exchange and derivative contracts   HDFC Bank Limited \nForeign exchange spot and forward contracts outstanding  as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are  revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively  as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for contracts  of interim maturities.  \nThe USD-INR rate for valuation of contracts having longer  maturities i.e. greater than one year, is derived using the  MIFOR and LIBOR curves. For other currency pairs, the  forward points (for rates / tenors not published by FEDAI)  are obtained from Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of  the forex deals. Valuation is considered on present value  basis, as directed by FEDAI. For this purpose the forward  profit or loss on the deals are discounted till the valuation  date using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss  on valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.  Foreign exchange contracts are classified as assets when  the fair value is positive (positive marked to market value) or  as liabilities when the fair value is negative (negative marked  to market value). \nForeign exchange forward contracts not intended for  trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of  reporting currency required or available at the settlement  date of a transaction and are outstanding at the Balance  Sheet date, are effectively valued at the closing spot rate.  The premium or discount arising at the inception of such  forward exchange contract is amortised as expense or  income over the life of the contract. \nThe Bank recognises all derivative contracts (other than  those designated as hedges) at fair value, on the date on  which the derivative contracts are entered into and are re- measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet or reporting  dates.

Changes in the fair value of derivatives  other than those designated as hedges are recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account. \n\nDerivative contracts designated as hedges are not marked  to market unless their underlying transaction is marked to  market. In respect of derivative contracts that are marked  to market, changes in the market value are recognised in  the Profit and Loss Account in the relevant period. The  Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the  inception of the transaction itself.

Interest payable to the members of the exempted  trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest  declared by the Central Government under the Employees  Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and  shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank. \nThe guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee  Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established  provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be  provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plans.  Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall  is done as per the guidance note issued in this respect by  The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards  this liability is made. \nThe overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the  respective applicable government social security scheme  calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries.  The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions,  which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in  the nature of defined contribution. \nLeave encashment: \nThe Bank has a policy of encashing unavailed leave for  eLKB employees under Indian Banks’ Association (IBA)  structure. The Bank provides for leave encashment based  on an independent actuarial valuation at the Balance Sheet  date, which includes assumptions about demographics,  early retirement, salary increases, interest rates and leave  utilisation. \n\nPension: \nIn respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees  under IBA structure, which is a defined benefit scheme,  the Bank contributes   $10\\%$   of basic salary to a pension  trust set up by the Bank and administered by the Board  of Trustees and an additional amount towards the liability  shortfall based on an independent actuarial valuation as  at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions  about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and  interest rates. \nIn respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to  a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure  and had completed less than 15 years of service, the  contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a  fund and will be converted into annuity on separation after a  lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees,  liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required  except for interest as applicable to Provident Fund, which  is provided for. \nIn respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC  structure and had completed service of more than 15 years,  pension would be paid on separation based on salary  applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure.  Provision thereto is made based on an independent  actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date. \nNew Pension Scheme (NPS): \nIn respect of employees who opt for contribution to the  NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic  salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined  contribution plan, which is managed and administered by  pension fund management companies. The Bank has no  liability other than its contribution, and recognises such  contributions as an expense in the year incurred. \nHDFC Securities Limited \nShort term \nShort term employee benefits include salaries and  performance incentives. A liability is recognised for the  amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus  or target based incentives if the Company has a present  legal or informal obligation to pay this amount as a result of  past service provided by the employee, and the obligation  can be estimated reliably. These costs are recognised as an  expense in the Profit and Loss Account at the undiscounted  amount expected to be paid over the period of services  rendered by the employees to the Company.  \nPost-employment \nThe Company offers its employees long term benefits by  way of defined-contribution and defined-benefit plans, of  which some have assets in special funds or securities. The  plans are financed by the Company and in the case of some  defined contribution plans by the Company along with its  employees. \n      Defined-contribution plans \nThese are plans in which the Company pays pre-defined  amounts to separate funds and does not have any legal  or informal obligation to pay additional sums. These  comprise of contributions to the National Pension Scheme,  Employees’ Provident Fund, Family Pension Fund and  Superannuation Fund. The Company’s payments to the  defined-contribution plans are reported as expenses during  the period in which the employees perform the services that  the payment covers. \nDefined-benefit plans \nExpenses for defined-benefit gratuity plan are calculated  as at the Balance Sheet date by an independent actuary  in a manner that distributes expenses over the employee’s  working life. These commitments are valued at the present  value of the expected future payments, with consideration  for calculated future salary increases, using a discount  rate corresponding to the interest rate estimated by the  actuary having regard to the interest rate on government  bonds with a remaining term that is almost equivalent to  the average balance working period of employees. The fair  values of the plan assets are deducted in determining the  net liability. When the fair value of plan assets exceeds the  commitments computed as aforesaid, the recognised asset  is limited to the net total of any cumulative past service costs  and the present value of any economic benefits available in  the form of reductions in future contributions to the plan.  \nActuarial losses or gains are recognised in the Profit and  Loss Account in the year in which they arise. \nOther long term employee benefits \nCompensated absences which accrue to employees and  which can be carried to future periods and are expected  to be availed in more than twelve months immediately  following the year in which the employee has rendered  service are reported as expenses during the year in which  the employees perform the services that the benefit covers  and the liabilities are reported at the undiscounted amount  of the benefits.  \nShare-based payment transactions \nEquity settled stock options granted under the Company’s  Employee Stock Option Schemes are accounted for as per  the accounting treatment prescribed by the Guidance Note  on Employee Share-based Payments issued by the Institute  of Chartered Accountants of India. The intrinsic value of the  option being excess of fair value of the underlying share  immediately prior to date of grant over its exercise price  is recognised as deferred employee compensation with  a credit to employee stock option outstanding account.  The deferred employee compensation is charged to Profit  and Loss Account on straight line basis over the vesting  period of the option. The options that lapse are reversed  by a credit to employee compensation expense, equal to  the amortised portion of value of lapsed portion and credit  to deferred employee compensation expense equal to the  unamortised portion. \n\nHDB Financial Services Limited  \nGratuity \nThe Company provides for gratuity to all employees. The  benefit is in the form of lump sum payments to vested  employees on resignation, retirement, or death while  in employment or on termination of employment of an  amount equivalent to 15 days basic salary payable for  each completed year of service. Vesting occurs upon  completion of five years of service. The Company makes  annual contributions to fund administered by trustees and  managed by insurance companies. The defined benefit  plan are valued by an independent external actuary as  at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit  method to determine the present value of defined benefit  obligation and the related service costs. Under this method,  the determination is based on actuarial calculations, which  include assumptions about demographics, early retirement,  salary increases and interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is  recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. \nProvident fund \nIn accordance with the applicable law, all employees of  the Company are entitled to receive benefits under the  Provident Fund Act, 1952. The Company contributes an  amount, on a monthly basis, at a determined rate to the  Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident  Fund Commissioner (‘RPFC’) and the Company has no  liability for future provident fund benefits other than its  annual contribution. Since it is a defined contribution plan,  the contributions are accounted for on an accrual basis and  recognized in the Profit and Loss Account. \n      Employee Stock Option Plan \nThe Company follows the intrinsic value method to account  for its stock-based employee compensation plans.  Compensation cost is measured by the excess, if any, of the  fair value of the underlying stock over the exercise price as  determined under the option plan. The fair value of options  have been estimated on the dates of each grant using the  Black-Scholes model. "}
