She never imagined one day  she would conduct laboratory and field -based research on malaria, leishma- niasis and filariasis in places like  Indonesia, Peru, and Egypt. This  international career was in parallel to  her distinguished rise in the ranks of  the Navy, holding a variety of leader- ship positions over the years.  \nVillasante went to the National  Research Council as a postdoctoral  fellow in the Le ishman i as is Laboratory  as part of the Division of Experimental  Therapeutics at the Walter Reed Army  Institute of Research. She discovered  the U.S. Navy, where they advertised,  “It‟s not just a Job, it‟s an Adventure.”  She was at Walter Reed for two years  prior to being commissioned as an  officer in the United States Navy in  1984. Not knowing that adventure  would be the career of a lifetime, she  signed up and has traveled to the  deepest pockets of the world re- searching infectious diseases.  \nOver her career, Villasante has  held several leadership positions in  \nThe image shows four people standing outdoors, possibly in a park during autumn, as there are leaves on the ground and trees in the background with fall colors.
