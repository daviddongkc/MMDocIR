T o reduce its impact on  nature, LVMH has chosen to have its plant and animal  supply chains certified to the highest standards for protect- ing biodiversity and animal welfare, and has prohibited  the sourcing of raw materials in areas with a high risk of  deforestation and desertification. LVMH is also taking  action to restore biodiversity, with the ambitious target of  restoring 5 million hectares of flora and fauna habitat  by 2030. T o give back what it borrows from nature, the  Group has implemented regenerative farming practices  with the assistance of a network of experts including  Biosphères, reNature, Earthworm, Pour une Agriculture  du Vivant and Savory Institute, for grapes, cotton, wool,  leather, palm, beets and the iconic ingredients used by the  Perfumes and Cosmetics Maisons. The Group’s partner- ship with UNESCO as part of its Man and the Biosphere  program has enabled it to support the sustainable use of  biodiversity with local populations in Bolivia, Ecuador,  Brazil and Peru. Meanwhile, Moët Hennessy has launched  reforestation programs in Kenya, China, the United States  and South Africa with its partner Reforest’Action, while  LVMH Italia has partnered with the ForestaMi project,  which aims to plant 3 million trees in the Milan metropol- itan area by 2030.

{"layout": 257, "type": "text", "text": "LIFE 360 aims to make preserving natural resources a  central focus of product design. This is the goal of the  Circular Design action plan, under which the Group aims  to apply a sustainable design approach to all of its prod- ucts by 2030. In 2021, Louis Vuitton expanded its range  of sustainably designed products, now branded with the  L V upcycling logo (combining Louis Vuitton’s initials with  the upcycling symbol), while Loewe offered a bag made  entirely of leather offcuts. L VMH’s 75 Maisons offer a vast  range of opportunities to explore potential new Group- wide circular design practices. For example, at Berluti,  leather offcuts are reclaimed by artist Jorge Penadés and  incorporated into furniture for Belmond hotels and stores.  In 2021, Nona Source – a resale platform for the Maisons’  unused fabrics – resonated with a wide audience of  in-house and outside buyers as soon as it was launched.  Product durability – a core component of LVMH’s busi- ness model – was extended by offering new services  inspired by the Watches & Jewelry business group, which,  in addition to repairing products, offers them a second  life by bestowing them with a new appearance. More than  ever in 2021, innovation played a key role in optimizing the  Group’s environmental impact: LVMH and Central Saint  Martins signed a new partnership to create a research  platform focused on regenerative luxury; Fendi, in part- nership with CSM and Imperial College London, explored  the possibility of transforming lab-made keratin into fibers,  then bio-based fur. Packaging followed a similar sustain- able design trajectory, with the aim of eliminating the use  of plastic derived from fossil fuels by 2026. The use of  Eastman molecular plastics recycling technologies is one  way of achieving this goal, as Parfums Christian Dior did  for the packaging of Dior Addict Lip Maximizer, released  in summer 2021.

{"layout": 260, "type": "text", "text": "The aim of LIFE 360 is to ensure full traceability across all  the Group’s strategic supply chains, for each step from  field to final product, with the goal of covering all sourcing  channels with a dedicated traceability system by 2030.  T o achieve this goal, L VMH has developed new solutions  tailored to each sourcing channel’s specific features, and  together with Prada Group and Cartier (a subsidiary of  Richemont) announced the launch of the Aura Block- chain Consortium: a unique, global blockchain solution,  open to all luxury brands worldwide to address shared  challenges in responsible sourcing. L VMH has also chosen  to participate in certification systems that ensure that  ethical, environmental and social standards are met at  each step of a material’s processing, including GOTS  (Global Organic T extile Standard) and RWS (Responsible  Wool Standard) for cotton and merino wool, and RJC  CoC (Responsible Jewellery Council Chain-of-Custody)  certification for precious metals such as gold. Rigorous  traceability is also key to being able to collect reliable  data, accurately measure a product’s environmental  performance and share this information with customers,  especially as the Group has set a target of ensuring each  product is covered by an information system by 2030.  Putting this idea into practice by making all its supplier  data available online, Fendi achieved a very significant  increase in its ranking in the Fashion Transparency Index in  2021. L VMH is also actively involved in initiatives currently  underway in France and Europe aimed at introducing  labeling that shows the environmental performance of  fashion products, and has joined forces with cosmetics  stakeholders to develop a rating system for the environ- mental impact of beauty products.

{"layout": 263, "type": "text", "text": "At the end of 2021, LVMH’s new carbon trajectory was  validated by SBTi (the Science Based T argets initiative). It  is based on the following targets: reducing greenhouse  gas emissions from energy consumption at its sites and  stores by  $50\\%$   by 2026 (baseline: 2019); and reducing  Scope 3 emissions (raw materials, purchases, transport,  waste, product use and end of life) by   $55\\%$   per unit of  added value by 2030 (baseline: 2019). The Group has  identified a number of key vectors to achieving these  targets, which are covered by specific action plans rolled  out at all of its Maisons, including having all sites and  stores use only renewable or low-carbon energy by 2026,  shifting toward shipping more freight by sea and by road,  and launching a green e-commerce program and a mate- rials innovation policy focused on Scope 3 emissions. In  2021, the climate roadmaps for the Group’s Maisons were  reflected in new policies on logistics, supply chains and  packaging. Starting in 2023, Hennessy will transport four  million bottles between France and the United States via  sailing cargo ships through a partnership with Neoline, a  maritime transport company; the Fashion and Leather  Goods Maisons (Berluti, Christian Dior Couture, Fendi,  Kenzo and Louis Vuitton) are focusing on certified or  recycled materials with a reduced carbon impact, while  Guerlain, Parfums Christian Dior and Givenchy offer refill- able or significantly lighter packaging: for example, refills  for Christian Dior’s fragrance  Sauvage  use less glass,  reducing the related greenhouse gas emissions by   $56\\%$  .  In fall 2021, L VMH and SAVE Energies (France’s second-­ largest buyer of biomethane) entered into a three-year  partnership to replace the Group’s fossil fuel consump- tion in France with green gas, allowing 14,000 metric tons  of  $C O_{2}$   equivalent emissions to be avoided each year  starting in 2023. At COP26, L VMH had the opportunity to  present and share news of these achievements, along  with the roll-out of regenerative farming practices, which,  by improving soil quality, also help maximize its carbon  capture potential.
