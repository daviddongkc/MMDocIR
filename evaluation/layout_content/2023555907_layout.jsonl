National  legislation defining unaccompanied minors in the  EU  member states  Greece ,  Germany ,  Italy ,  and  France ,   draws on the EU definition. In  Israel , procedures from the Population and  Immigration Authority form the definition.  Malta  provides a definition in legislation, which is  further defined in regulation.

In  Malta , unaccompanied minors are not to be held in detention, although, in practice, many are  held under the authority of health regulations.

In  Greece , some migrants are resettled elsewhere in Europe under an  EU  resettlement program. In  France , the law and jurisprudence grant unaccompanied minors access  to the same programs and services as French citizens.  Malta  recently launched an integration  program that leads to the issuance of a certificate after 230 hours of instruction.  Turkey  provides  child asylum seekers with basic educational programming, but does not envisage the permanent  settlement of refugees on its territory, instead working with the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) toward the resettlement of asylum seekers.

The Greek international protection legislation provides  procedural protections to unaccompanied minors by adopting the best interest of the  minor as a general principle in making decisions, and under certain circumstances  exempting unaccompanied minors from disadvantageous fast-track procedures for the  examination of asylum applications. The law establishes a centralized database of  qualified legal entities that act as “guardianship service providers,” from which  guardians are appointed to unaccompanied minors. The law designates the Special  Secretariat for the Protection of Unaccompanied Minors under the Ministry of  Migration and Asylum as the competent body responsible for administering the rules  regarding the accommodation and care of unaccompanied minors, in cooperation with  the minor’s appointed guardian and other immigration and social services authorities.  While guardianship service providers remain the legal guardian of the unaccompanied  minor, the law provides for various options for the physical custody and daily care of  the minor, including placement with a foster family, accommodation in a full-service  long-term accommodation center, or accommodation in semi-independent living  facilities for older minors. General rules regarding repatriation are applicable to  unaccompanied minors if and when their asylum applications are denied, or their status  terminated. Unaccompanied minors have been resettled in other European countries  through a voluntary resettlement program funded by the European Union.

The core rule is that MSNA  may never be rejected at the border, and refoulement and expulsion are prohibited.  Once a MSNA is found in the Italian territory, they must be provided with a full array  of health and social services and assistance aimed at their identification, determination  of age, and wellbeing. The paramount rule is that all decisions must be made based on  the best interest of the child. Once MSNA have been provided with basic services, the  legislation grants them a roster of legal and social benefits first and foremost, and a  residence permit allows them to pursue educational and social integration  opportunities. Repatriation of MSNA is allowed under strict criteria and conditions,  and family reunification is broadly permitted pursuant to European Union and  domestic Italian legislation.
