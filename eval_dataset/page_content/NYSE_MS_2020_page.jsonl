In addition to capital regulations, the  U.S. banking agencies and the Basel Committee have adopted  liquidity and funding standards. We, MSBNA and MSPBNA  are, and following a transition period ETB will be, subject to  the U.S. banking agencies’ LCR requirements, which  generally follow Basel Committee standards. Similarly, when  the final NSFR requirements issued by the U.S. banking  agencies become effective July 1, 2021, we, MSBNA,  MSPBNA and ETB will become subject to NSFR  requirements, which generally follow Basel Committee  standards. \nIn addition to the LCR and NSFR, we and many of our  regulated subsidiaries are subject to other liquidity standards,  including liquidity stress testing and associated liquidity  reserve requirements. \nFor more information, see “Management’s Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Liquidity  Framework.” \nSystemic Risk Regime.     The Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by  the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer  Protection Act (“EGRRCPA”), establishes a systemic risk  regime to which certain large BHCs, including Morgan  Stanley, are subject. Under rules issued by the Federal  Reserve to implement certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank  Act’s enhanced prudential standards, such large BHCs must  conduct internal liquidity stress tests, maintain unencumbered  highly liquid assets to meet projected net cash outflows for 30  days over the range of liquidity stress scenarios used in  internal stress tests, and comply with various liquidity risk  management requirements. These large BHCs also must  comply with a range of risk management and corporate  governance requirements. "}

Other sanctions that may be imposed  include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on  engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or  for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations,  other censures and significant fines. \n\nThe Firm is subject to various regulations that affect broker- dealer sales practices and customer relationships. For  example, the SEC's “Regulation Best Interest,” requires  broker-dealers to act in the “best interest” of retail customers  at the time a recommendation is made without placing the  financial or other interests of the broker-dealer ahead of the  interest of the retail customer. Certain states have enacted  laws or rules, or are considering laws or rules, subjecting  broker-dealers to a fiduciary duty when dealing with retail  customers under a variety of circumstances. \nMargin lending by broker-dealers is regulated by the Federal  Reserve’s restrictions on lending in connection with customer  and proprietary purchases and short sales of securities, as well  as securities borrowing and lending activities. Broker-dealers  are also subject to maintenance and other margin  requirements imposed under FINRA and other self-regulatory  organization rules. In many cases, our broker-dealer  subsidiaries’ margin policies are more stringent than these  rules. \nAs registered U.S. broker-dealers, certain of our subsidiaries  are subject to the SEC’s net capital rule and the net capital  requirements  of  various  exchanges,  other  regulatory  authorities and self-regulatory organizations. These rules are  generally designed to measure the broker-dealer subsidiary’s  general financial integrity and/or liquidity and require that at  least a minimum amount of net and/or liquid assets be  maintained by the subsidiary. See also “Financial Holding  Company—Consolidated  Supervision”  and  “Financial  Holding Company—Liquidity Standards” above. Rules of  FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations also impose  limitations and requirements on the transfer of member  organizations’ assets. \nResearch.   Research-related  regulations  have  been  implemented in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S.,  where FINRA has adopted rules that cover research relating  to both equity and debt securities. Regulators continue to  focus on research conflicts of interest and may impose  additional regulations.

For a further discussion of the  culture, values, and conduct of employees, see “Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Risk Management.” \nDiversity and Inclusion \nWe believe that a diverse workforce is important to Morgan  Stanley’s continued success and our ability to serve our  clients. To this end, we pursue a comprehensive diversity and  inclusion strategy based on four pillars: accountability,  representation, advancement and culture. To build a diverse  talent pipeline, we use global, targeted recruitment and  development programs to hire, retain and promote female and  ethnically diverse talent. Further evidencing this commitment,  in 2020, we launched the Morgan Stanley Institute for  Inclusion, which will help lead an integrated and transparent  diversity, equity and inclusion strategy to deliver our full  potential to achieve meaningful change within our Firm and  beyond, including our communities. \nTalent Development and Retention \nWe are committed to identifying and developing the talents of  our workforce, as well as succession planning. Our talent  development programs provide employees with the resources  they need to help achieve their career goals, build  management skills and lead their organizations. We also focus  on the retention of our talented and skilled employees as one  key component of a successful business and culture. \nCompensation and Financial Wellness \nWe pursue responsible and effective compensation programs  that reinforce our values and culture through four key  objectives: delivering pay for sustainable performance,  attracting and retaining top talent, aligning with shareholder  interests and mitigating excessive risk taking. In addition to  salaries, these programs (which vary by location) include  annual bonuses, retirement savings plans with matching  contributions, student loan refinancing, free will preparation  through our legal plan and supplemental life insurance  program, discounted group insurance options, and a financial  wellness program in the U.S. and the U.K. To promote  equitable rewards for all employees, including female and  ethnically diverse employees, we have enhanced our practices  to support fair and consistent compensation and reward  decisions based on merit, perform ongoing reviews of  compensation decisions, including at the point of hire and  promotion, and conduct regular assessments of our rewards  structure.

Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may\nmake it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain of\nour financial instruments, particularly during periods of\nmarket displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant\nchanges in the values of these instruments and may adversely\nimpact historical or prospective fees and performance-based\nfees (also known as incentive fees, which include carried\ninterest) in respect of certain businesses. In addition, at the\ntime of any sales and settlements of these financial\ninstruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the\ndemand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of these\nfactors could cause a decline in the value of our financial\ninstruments, which may have an adverse effect on our results\nof operations in future periods.\n\nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events\nevidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied\nby a reduction in asset liquidity. Under these extreme\nconditions, hedging and other risk management strategies may\nnot be as effective at mitigating trading losses as they would\nbe under more normal market conditions.

Market volatility, illiquid  market conditions and disruptions in the credit markets may  make it extremely difficult to value and monetize certain of  our financial instruments, particularly during periods of  market displacement. Subsequent valuations in future periods,  in light of factors then prevailing, may result in significant  changes in the values of these instruments and may adversely  impact historical or prospective fees and performance-based  fees (also known as incentive fees, which include carried  interest) in respect of certain businesses. In addition, at the  time of any sales and settlements of these financial  instruments, the price we ultimately realize will depend on the  demand and liquidity in the market at that time and may be  materially lower than their current fair value. Any of these  factors could cause a decline in the value of our financial  instruments, which may have an adverse effect on our results  of operations in future periods. \nIn addition, financial markets are susceptible to severe events  evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied  by a reduction in asset liquidity.

For more information\non how we monitor and manage liquidity risk, see\n“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial\nCondition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital\nResources” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures\nabout Risk—Liquidity Risk.”\n\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses and we rely on\nexternal sources to finance a significant portion of our\noperations.\n\nLiquidity is essential to our businesses. Our liquidity could be\nnegatively affected by our inability to raise funding in the\nlong-term or short-term debt capital markets, our inability to\naccess the secured lending markets, or unanticipated outflows\nof cash or collateral by customers or clients. Factors that we\ncannot control, such as disruption of the financial markets or\nnegative views about the financial services industry generally,\nincluding concerns regarding fiscal matters in the U.S. and\nother geographic areas, could impair our ability to raise\nfunding.\n\nIn addition, our ability to raise funding could be impaired if\ninvestors or lenders develop a negative perception of our\nlong-term or short-term financial prospects due to factors such\nas an incurrence of large trading losses, a downgrade by the\nrating agencies, a decline in the level of our business activity,\nif regulatory authorities take significant action against us or\n", "vlm_text": "\nLike other financial services firms, the Firm, its third party  providers, and its clients continue to be the subject of  unauthorized access attacks, mishandling or misuse of  information, computer viruses or malware, cyber attacks  designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data,  disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other  damage, denial of service attacks, data breaches, social  engineering attacks and other events. There can be no  assurance that such unauthorized access, mishandling or  misuse of information, or cyber incidents will not occur in the  future, and they could occur more frequently and on a more  significant scale. \nA cyber attack, information or security breach or a technology  failure of ours or of a third party could jeopardize our or our  clients’, employees’, partners’, vendors’ or counterparties’  personal, confidential, proprietary or other information  processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our and our  third parties’ computer systems. Furthermore, such events  could cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our clients’,  employees’, partners’, vendors’, counterparties’ or third  parties’ operations, as well as the unauthorized release,  gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of  confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our  employees, our customers or of other third parties. Any of  these events could result in reputational damage with our  clients and the market, client dissatisfaction, additional costs  to us to maintain and update our operational and security  systems  and  infrastructure,  regulatory  investigations,  litigation or enforcement, or regulatory fines or penalties, any  of which could adversely affect our business, financial  condition or results of operations. \nGiven our global footprint and the high volume of  transactions we process, the large number of clients, partners,  vendors and counterparties with which we do business, and  the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks, a cyber attack,  information or security breach could occur and persist for an  extended period of time without detection. We expect that any  investigation of a cyber attack would be inherently  unpredictable and that it would take time before the  completion of any investigation and before there is  availability of full and reliable information. During such time  we would not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how  best to remediate it, and certain errors or actions could be  repeated or compounded before they are discovered and  remediated, all or any of which would further increase the  costs and consequences of a cyber attack. \n\nWhile many of our agreements with partners and third party  vendors include indemnification provisions, we may not be  able to recover sufficiently, or at all, under such provisions to  adequately offset any losses we may incur. In addition,  although we maintain insurance coverage that may, subject to  policy terms and conditions, cover certain aspects of cyber  and information security risks, such insurance coverage may  be insufficient to cover all losses. \nWe continue to make investments with a view toward  maintaining and enhancing our cybersecurity posture. The  cost of managing cyber and information security risks and  attacks along with complying with new, increasingly  expansive, and evolving regulatory requirements could  adversely affect our results of operations and business. \nLiquidity Risk \nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to  finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital  markets or difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk  also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our  financial  obligations  without  experiencing  significant  business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten  our viability as a going concern as well as the associated  funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress  events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may  impact our ability to raise new funding.

The\ncombined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the\nTLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the\nholders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible\nTLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are\nimposed on the creditors of our material entities or before\nputting U.S. taxpayers at risk.\n\nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other\nE.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of\nimplementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide\nresolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing\nentity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain\nunsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities\ninto equity. Such “bail-in” powers are intended to enable the\nrecapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to\nits shareholders and unsecured creditors. Non-U.S. regulators\nare also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of\nlarge financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of\nTLAC that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the\nParent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the\nParent Company in the event of failure.\n\nWe may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other\ncapital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised\nregulatory capital standards.\n\nWe are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision,\nregulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, including\nwith respect to regulatory capital standards, stress testing and\ncapital planning. We submit, on at least an annual basis, a\ncapital plan to the Federal Reserve describing proposed\ndividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of\nour outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions\n\n19\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nthat we intend to take. Our ability to take capital actions\ndescribed in the capital plan is dependent on, among other\nfactors, the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the\nFederal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital\nstandards imposed by the Federal Reserve.\n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory\ncapital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict\nour ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose\nother regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our\noperating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital\nactions. For example, on June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nannounced that it would bar share repurchases and limit\ncommon stock dividend payments in the third quarter of 2020\nfor all large BHCs, and on September 30, 2020, the\nrestrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOn December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it\nwas extending capital action supervisory restrictions\napplicable to all large BHCs into the first quarter of 2021 with\nmodifications to permit resumptions of share repurchases. The\nFederal Reserve may extend or further modify these\nrestrictions in future periods or impose new restrictions. For\nadditional information, see “Management’s Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—\nLiquidity and Capital Resources” herein.\n\nThe financial services industry faces substantial litigation\nand is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement\ninvestigations, and we may face damage to our reputation\nand legal liability.\n\nAs a global financial services firm, we face the risk of\ninvestigations and proceedings by governmental and self-\nregulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct\nour business.

For example, the Federal Reserve requires top-tier BHCs of  U.S. G-SIBs, including the Firm, to maintain minimum  amounts of equity and eligible long-term debt TLAC in order  to ensure that such institutions have enough loss-absorbing  resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the  conversion of debt to equity or otherwise by imposing losses  on eligible TLAC where the SPOE strategy is used. The  combined implication of the SPOE resolution strategy and the  TLAC requirement is that our losses will be imposed on the  holders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible  TLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are  imposed on the creditors of our material entities or before  putting U.S. taxpayers at risk. \nIn addition, certain jurisdictions, including the U.K. and other  E.U. jurisdictions, have implemented, or are in the process of  implementing, changes to resolution regimes to provide  resolution authorities with the ability to recapitalize a failing  entity organized in such jurisdiction by writing down certain  unsecured liabilities or converting certain unsecured liabilities  into equity. Such “bail-in” powers are intended to enable the  recapitalization of a failing institution by allocating losses to  its shareholders and unsecured creditors. Non-U.S. regulators  are also considering requirements that certain subsidiaries of  large financial institutions maintain minimum amounts of  TLAC that would pass losses up from the subsidiaries to the  Parent Company and, ultimately, to security holders of the  Parent Company in the event of failure. \nWe may be prevented from paying dividends or taking other  capital actions because of regulatory constraints or revised  regulatory capital standards. \nWe are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision,  regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, including  with respect to regulatory capital standards, stress testing and  capital planning. We submit, on at least an annual basis, a  capital plan to the Federal Reserve describing proposed  dividend payments to shareholders, proposed repurchases of  our outstanding securities and other proposed capital actions  that we intend to take. Our ability to take capital actions  described in the capital plan is dependent on, among other  factors, the results of supervisory stress tests conducted by the  Federal Reserve and our compliance with regulatory capital  standards imposed by the Federal Reserve. \n\nIn addition, the Federal Reserve may change regulatory  capital standards to impose higher requirements that restrict  our ability to take capital actions or may modify or impose  other regulatory standards or restrictions that increase our  operating expenses or constrain our ability to take capital  actions. For example, on June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve  announced that it would bar share repurchases and limit  common stock dividend payments in the third quarter of 2020  for all large BHCs, and on September 30, 2020, the  restrictions were extended through the fourth quarter of 2020.  On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it  was  extending  capital  action  supervisory  restrictions  applicable to all large BHCs into the first quarter of 2021 with  modifications to permit resumptions of share repurchases. The  Federal Reserve may extend or further modify these  restrictions in future periods or impose new restrictions. For  additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and  Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—  Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein. \nThe financial services industry faces substantial litigation  and is subject to extensive regulatory and law enforcement  investigations, and we may face damage to our reputation  and legal liability. \nAs a global financial services firm, we face the risk of  investigations and proceedings by governmental and self- regulatory organizations in all countries in which we conduct  our business. Investigations and proceedings initiated by these  authorities may result in adverse judgments, settlements,  fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. In addition to the  monetary consequences, these measures could, for example,  impact our ability to engage in, or impose limitations on,  certain of our businesses. \nThese investigations and proceedings, as well as the amount  of penalties and fines sought, continue to impact the financial  services industry and certain U.S. and international  governmental entities have brought criminal actions against,  or have sought criminal convictions, pleas or deferred  prosecution  agreements  from,  financial  institutions.  Significant regulatory or law enforcement action against us  could materially adversely affect our business, financial  condition or results of operations or cause us significant  reputational harm, which could seriously harm our business. \nThe Dodd-Frank Act also provides compensation to  whistleblowers who present the SEC or CFTC with  information related to securities or commodities law  violations that leads to a successful enforcement action.

Such changes could result in our remaining  competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such  as the ability to offer a broader range of products and services  and geographic diversity, or new competitors may emerge. \nWe have experienced and may continue to experience pricing  pressures as a result of these factors and as some of our  competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices,  eliminating commissions or other fees, or providing more  favorable terms of business. In addition, certain of our  competitors may be subject to different, and, in some cases,  less stringent, legal and regulatory regimes, than we are,  thereby putting us at a competitive disadvantage. Some new  competitors in the financial technology sector have sought to  target existing segments of our businesses that could be  susceptible to disruption by innovative or less regulated  business models. For more information regarding the  competitive environment in which we operate, see “Business —Competition”  and  “Business—Supervision  and  Regulation.” \nAutomated trading markets and the introduction and  application of new technologies may adversely affect our  business and may increase competition. \nWe have experienced intense price competition in some of  our businesses in recent years. In particular, the ability to  execute securities, derivatives and other financial instrument  trades electronically on exchanges, swap execution facilities,  other automated trading platforms and the introduction and  application of new technologies has increased the pressure on  bid-offer spreads, commissions, markups or comparable fees.  \nThe trend toward direct access to automated, electronic  markets will likely continue and will likely increase as  additional markets move to more automated trading  platforms. We have experienced and it is likely that we will  continue to experience competitive pressures in these and  other areas in the future as some of our competitors may seek  to obtain market share by reducing or eliminating bid-offer  spreads, commissions, markups or fees. \nOur ability to retain and attract qualified employees is  critical to the success of our business and the failure to do  so may materially adversely affect our performance. \nOur people are our most important asset and competition for  qualified employees is intense. If we are unable to continue to  attract and retain highly qualified employees, or do so at  levels or in forms necessary to maintain our competitive  position, or if compensation costs required to attract and  retain employees become more expensive, our performance,  including our competitive position and results of operations,  could be materially adversely affected. \nThe financial industry has experienced and may continue to  experience  more  stringent  regulation  of  employee  compensation, including limitations relating to incentive- based compensation, clawback requirements and special  taxation, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to  hire or retain the most qualified employees. \nInternational Risk \nWe are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax,  operational, franchise and other risks as a result of our  international operations which could adversely impact our  businesses in many ways. \nWe are subject to numerous political, economic, legal, tax,  operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in  operating in many countries, including risks of possible  nationalization, expropriation, price controls, capital controls,  exchange controls, increased taxes and levies, and other  restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of  hostilities or political and governmental instability. In many  countries, the laws and regulations applicable to the securities  and financial services industries are uncertain and evolving,  and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact  requirements of local laws in every market. \nOur inability to remain in compliance with local laws in a  particular market could have a significant and negative effect  not only on our business in that market but also on our  reputation generally. We are also subject to the risk that  transactions we structure might not be legally enforceable in  all cases. \nVarious emerging market countries have experienced severe  political, economic or financial disruptions, including  significant devaluations of their currencies, defaults or  potential defaults on sovereign debt, capital and currency  exchange controls, high rates of inflation and low or negative  growth rates in their economies. Crime and corruption, as  well as issues of security and personal safety, also exist in  certain of these countries. These conditions could adversely  impact our businesses and increase volatility in financial  markets generally. "}

These performance fees  are generally recognized annually. \nNet Interest \nInterest income and Interest expense are functions of the level  and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets  and Trading liabilities, Investment securities, Securities  borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, Securities  loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, Loans,  Deposits and Borrowings.  \nWithin the Institutional Securities business segment, Net  interest is a function of market-making strategies, client  activity, and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility  of interest rates. Net interest is impacted by market-making  activities as securities held by the Firm generally earn interest,  as do securities borrowed and securities purchased under  agreements to resell, while securities loaned and securities  sold under agreements to repurchase generally incur interest  expense.  \nWithin the Wealth Management business segment, Interest  income is driven by Investment securities, Loans and margin  loans. Interest expense is driven by Deposits and other  funding. Upon acquisition, E\\*TRADE’s Investment securities  were recorded at fair value, and the resulting premium will be  amortized over the life of the portfolio against interest  income. \nOther \nOther revenues for Institutional Securities include revenues  and losses from equity method investments, lending  "}

It is divided into several categories: Equity, Fixed Income, Alternative/Other, Long-term AUM Subtotal, Liquidity, and Total AUM.\n\n- For Equity, the amounts are $111 billion in 2018, $124 billion in 2019, and $174 billion in 2020.\n- For Fixed Income, the amounts are $71 billion in both 2018 and 2019, and $86 billion in 2020.\n- For Alternative/Other, the amounts are $131 billion in 2018, $134 billion in 2019, and $145 billion in 2020.\n- The Long-term AUM Subtotal amounts are $313 billion in 2018, $329 billion in 2019, and $405 billion in 2020.\n- For Liquidity, the amounts are $158 billion in 2018, $171 billion in 2019, and $252 billion in 2020.\n- The Total AUM amounts are $471 billion in 2018, $500 billion in 2019, and $657 billion in 2020.\nThe table presents data on fee rates in basis points (bps) for different financial categories over three years (2020, 2019, and 2018). The categories included in the table are:\n\n1. Equity: The fee rate remains consistent at 76 bps across all three years.\n2. Fixed Income: The fee rate decreases from 33 bps in 2018 to 32 bps in 2019, and further to 29 bps in 2020.\n3. Alternative/Other: The fee rate drops from 66 bps in 2018 to 64 bps in 2019, and then to 58 bps in 2020.\n4. Long-term AUM (Assets Under Management): The fee rate declined from 62 bps in 2018 to 61 bps in 2019, and further to 60 bps in 2020.\n5. Liquidity: The fee rate remains steady at 17 bps from 2018 to 2019 and then decreases to 15 bps in 2020.\n6. Total AUM: The fee rate reduces from 47 bps in 2018 to 46 bps in 2019, and falls to 42 bps in 2020.\n\nIn summary, the table shows a general trend of decreasing fee rates over the three-year period across these categories, with the exception of the Equity category, which remains constant.\n• Inflows —represent investments or commitments from new  and existing clients in new or existing investment products,  including reinvestments of client dividends and increases in  invested capital. Inflows exclude the impact of exchanges,  whereby a client changes positions within the same asset  class.\n\n \n• Outflows —represent redemptions from clients’ funds,  transition of funds from the committed capital period to the  invested capital period and decreases in invested capital.  Outflows exclude the impact of exchanges, whereby a  client changes positions within the same asset class.\n\n \n•  Market impact —includes realized and unrealized gains and  losses on portfolio investments. This excludes any funds  where market impact does not impact management fees.\n\n \n• Other —contains both distributions and foreign currency  impact for all periods and the impact of the Mesa West  Capital, LLC acquisition in 2018. Distributions represent  decreases in invested capital due to returns of capital after  the investment period of a fund. It also includes fund  dividends that the client has not reinvested. Foreign  currency impact reflects foreign currency changes for non- U.S. dollar dominated funds.\n\n \n• Alternative/Other —includes products in fund of funds, real  estate, infrastructure, private equity and credit strategies, as  well as multi-asset portfolios.\n\n \n• Average fee rate —based on Asset management revenues,  net of waivers, excluding performance-based fees and other  non-management fees. For certain non-U.S. funds, it  includes the portion of advisory fees that the advisor  collects on behalf of third-party distributors. The payment  of those fees to the distributor is included in Non- compensation expenses in the income statements. \nPlanned Acquisition of Eaton Vance \nOn October 8, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement  under which we will acquire Eaton Vance, a leading provider  of advanced investment management strategies and wealth  management solutions, in a cash and stock transaction valued,  as of the announcement, at approximately  $\\S7$   billion, based on  the 3-day volume-weighted average price of our common  stock prior to October 7, 2020 and the number of Eaton  Vance’s fully diluted shares outstanding on October 7, 2020.  Under the terms of the agreement, Eaton Vance common  stockholders will receive  $\\S28.25$   in cash and 0.5833 shares of  our common shares for each Eaton Vance common share. In  addition, Eaton Vance common shareholders as of December  4, 2020 received a one-time special cash dividend of   $\\S4.25$  per share on December 18, 2020, which was paid by Eaton  Vance. We currently expect to complete the acquisition on  March 1, 2021. Completion of the transaction remains subject  to customary closing conditions. "}

A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair\nvalue that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs\nand minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by\nrequiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when\navailable. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels,\nwherein Level | represents quoted prices in active markets,\nLevel 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in\nmarkets that are not active or for which all significant inputs\nare observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques\nthat incorporate significant unobservable inputs and,\ntherefore, require the greatest use of judgment.\n\nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices\nand inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could\ncause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to\nLevel 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in\nmarket conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of\nmany instruments. For further information on the definition of\nfair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation\ntechniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity\nof significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value\nmeasurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements.\n\nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account\nfor various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask\nadjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration\nrisk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further\ndiscussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2\nto the financial statements.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\n\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of\nJuly 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or\ncircumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment\nrequires management to make significant judgments.\nGoodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit\nlevel, which is generally at the level of or one level below our\nbusiness segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association\nwith a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a\nreporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit,\nwhether acquired or organically developed, are available to\nsupport the value of the goodwill.\n\nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to\neither (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first\nperform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is\nmore likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is\n\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K\n\n44\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nless than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative\ntest would be performed.\n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare\nthe fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is\ness than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is\nequal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value,\nimited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit.\n\nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived\nbased on valuation techniques we believe market participants\nwould use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair\nvalue is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash\nflow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-\nbook and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable\ncompanies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date,\neach of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that\nwas substantially in excess of its carrying value.\n\nIntangible Assets\n\nAmortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or\nin the situation where acquired as part of a_ business\ncombination, at the fair value determined as part of the\nacquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, they are\ncarried in the balance sheets at amortized cost, where\namortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nWhen certain events or circumstances exist, amortizable\nintangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim\nbasis. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the\nintangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss\nwill be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible\nasset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The\ncarrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it\nexceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows.\n\nThe initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the\nacquisition method of accounting and the subsequent\nvaluation of intangible assets as part of impairment\nassessments are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that\nare unobservable. These inputs include, but are not limited to,\nforecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer\nattrition rates and discount rates.\n\nFor both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an\nimpairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new\ncost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment\nlosses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the\nnew cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of\nthat asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in\nimpairment charges in future periods.\n\nSee Notes 2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for\nadditional information about goodwill and intangible assets.\n", "vlm_text": "Management's Discussion and Analysis \n• Certain Other secured financings; and\n\n • Certain Borrowings. \nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell  an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e. , the exit price) in an  orderly transaction between market participants at the  measurement date. \nIn determining fair value, we use various valuation  approaches. A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair  value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs  and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by  requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when  available. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels,  wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets,  Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in  markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs  are observable, and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques  that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and,  therefore, require the greatest use of judgment.  \nIn periods of market disruption, the observability of prices  and inputs may be reduced for many instruments, which could  cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to  Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in  market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of  many instruments. For further information on the definition of  fair value, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation  techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity  of significant unobservable inputs used in Level 3 fair value  measurements, see Notes 2 and 5 to the financial statements. \nWhere appropriate, valuation adjustments are made to account  for various factors such as liquidity risk (bid-ask  adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty, concentration  risk and funding in order to arrive at fair value. For a further  discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2  to the financial statements. \nGoodwill and Intangible Assets \nGoodwill \nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of  July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or  circumstances exist. Evaluating goodwill for impairment  requires management to make significant judgments.  Goodwill impairment tests are performed at the reporting unit  level, which is generally at the level of or one level below our  business segments. Goodwill no longer retains its association  with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a  reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit,  whether acquired or organically developed, are available to  support the value of the goodwill. \nFor both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to  either (i) perform a quantitative impairment test or (ii) first  perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is  more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is  less than its carrying amount, in which case the quantitative  test would be performed. \n\nWhen performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare  the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount,  including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is  less than its carrying amount, the goodwill impairment loss is  equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value,  limited by the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to that  reporting unit. \nThe estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived  based on valuation techniques we believe market participants  would use for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair  value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash  flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to- book and price-to-earnings multiples of certain comparable  companies. At each annual goodwill impairment testing date,  each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that  was substantially in excess of its carrying value. \nIntangible Assets \nAmortizable intangible assets are initially recorded at cost, or  in the situation where acquired as part of a business  combination, at the fair value determined as part of the  acquisition method of accounting. Subsequently, they are  carried in the balance sheets at amortized cost, where  amortization is recognized over their estimated useful lives. \nWhen certain events or circumstances exist, amortizable  intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an interim  basis. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the  intangible asset exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss  will be recognized if the carrying amount of the intangible  asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The  carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it  exceeds the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows. \nThe initial valuation of an intangible asset as part of the  acquisition method of accounting and the subsequent  valuation of intangible assets as part of impairment  assessments are subjective and based, in part, on inputs that  are unobservable. These inputs include, but are not limited to,  forecasted cash flows, revenue growth rates, customer  attrition rates and discount rates. \nFor both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an  impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new  cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment  losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the  new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of  that asset. Adverse market or economic events could result in  impairment charges in future periods. \nSee Notes 2, 3 and 11 to the financial statements for  additional information about goodwill and intangible assets.

It includes:\n\n1. **Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed:**\n   - December 31, 2020: $228,625 million\n   - December 31, 2019: $194,773 million\n\n2. **Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned:**\n   - December 31, 2020: $58,318 million\n   - December 31, 2019: $62,706 million\n\n3. **Securities received as collateral:**\n   - December 31, 2020: $4,277 million\n   - December 31, 2019: $13,022 million\n\nAdditionally, it shows the average daily balance for the three months ended in December for both years:\n\n1. **Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed:**\n   - December 31, 2020: $195,376 million\n   - December 31, 2019: $210,257 million\n\n2. **Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned:**\n   - December 31, 2020: $54,528 million\n   - December 31, 2019: $64,870 million\nSee “Total Assets by Business Segment” herein for more  details on the assets shown in the previous table and Notes 2  and 9 to the financial statements for more details on  collateralized financing transactions. \nIn addition to the collateralized financing transactions shown  in the previous table, we engage in financing transactions  collateralized by customer-owned securities, which are  segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements.  Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily  margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables  in the balance sheets, and payables under these financing  transactions, primarily to prime brokerage customers, are  included in Customer and other payables in the balance  sheets. Our risk exposure on these transactions is mitigated by  collateral maintenance policies and the elements of our  Liquidity Risk Management Framework.  \nUnsecured Financing \nWe view deposits and borrowings as stable sources of funding  for unencumbered securities and non-security assets. Our  unsecured financings include borrowings and certificates of  deposit carried at fair value, which are primarily composed of:  \ninstruments whose payments and redemption values are  linked to the performance of a specific index, a basket of  stocks, a specific equity security, a commodity, a credit  exposure or basket of credit exposures; and instruments with  various interest-rate-related features, including step-ups, step- downs and zero coupons. As part of our asset/liability  management strategy, when appropriate, we use derivatives to  make adjustments to the interest rate risk profile of our  borrowings (see Notes 7 and 14 to the financial statements). \nThe table presents financial data in millions of dollars for two categories of deposits as of two different dates: December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. It distinguishes between savings and demand deposits, and time deposits. Here's a breakdown of the information in the table:\n\n1. **Savings and Demand Deposits:**\n   - Brokerage Sweep Deposits:\n     - $232,071 million as of December 31, 2020\n     - $121,077 million as of December 31, 2019\n   - Savings and Other:\n     - $47,150 million as of December 31, 2020\n     - $28,388 million as of December 31, 2019\n   - Total Savings and Demand Deposits:\n     - $279,221 million as of December 31, 2020\n     - $149,465 million as of December 31, 2019\n\n2. **Time Deposits:**\n   - $31,561 million as of December 31, 2020\n   - $40,891 million as of December 31, 2019\n\n3. **Total Deposits:**\n   - $310,782 million as of December 31, 2020\n   - $190,356 million as of December 31, 2019\n\nThe comparison shows an increase in both savings and demand deposits, as well as an overall increase in total deposits from 2019 to 2020, with a decrease in time deposits.\nDeposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management  clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding  characteristics. Total deposits increased in 2020, primarily  driven by increases in brokerage sweep and savings deposits,  including incremental deposits as a result of the acquisition of  E\\*TRADE. \nThe table provides an overview of borrowings, categorized by the original maturity period and sorted into Parent Company and Subsidiaries totals, presented in millions of dollars. Here’s a breakdown of the table's information:\n\n1. **Original maturities of one year or less**:\n   - Parent Company: $1 million\n   - Subsidiaries: $3,690 million\n   - Total: $3,691 million\n\n2. **Original maturities greater than one year (by year)**:\n   - 2021:\n     - Parent Company: $17,670 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $6,571 million\n     - Total: $24,241 million\n   - 2022:\n     - Parent Company: $16,612 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $5,597 million\n     - Total: $22,209 million\n   - 2023:\n     - Parent Company: $17,152 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $5,738 million\n     - Total: $22,890 million\n   - 2024:\n     - Parent Company: $16,109 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $5,618 million\n     - Total: $21,727 million\n   - 2025:\n     - Parent Company: $11,336 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $7,300 million\n     - Total: $18,636 million\n   - Thereafter:\n     - Parent Company: $80,943 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $22,742 million\n     - Total: $103,685 million\n\n3. **Totals**:\n   - Total borrowings for maturities greater than one year:\n     - Parent Company: $159,822 million\n     - Subsidiaries: $53,566 million\n     - Total: $213,388 million\n\n4. **Overall Total Borrowings**:\n   - Parent Company: $159,823 million\n   - Subsidiaries: $57,256 million\n   - Total Borrowings: $217,079 million\nBorrowings of   $\\S217$   billion as of December 31, 2020  increased compared with   $\\S193$   billion at December 31, 2019,  primarily as a result of issuances net of maturities and  redemptions, as well as fair value adjustments. \nWe believe that accessing debt investors through multiple  distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the  unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings  with original maturities greater than one year allows us to  reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments.  Borrowings with original maturities greater than one year are  generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby  "}

The first method considers the G-SIB’s size,\ninterconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity\nand substitutability, which is generally consistent with the\nmethodology developed by the Basel Committee (“Method\n1”). The second method uses similar inputs but replaces\nsubstitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding\n(“Method 2”) and generally results in higher surcharges than\nthe first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be\nsatisfied using Common Equity Tier | capital and functions as\nan extension of the capital conservation buffer.\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and\nClean Holding Company Requirements\n\nThe Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-\nterm debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements\nfor top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”),\nincluding the Parent Company. These requirements are\ndesigned to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss-\nabsorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized\nthrough the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise\nby imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC\nwhere an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see “Business—\nSupervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company—\nResolution and Recovery Planning” and “Risk Factors—\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk’’).\n\nThese TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various\nrestrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by\nthe covered BHC and be unsecured; have a maturity of one\nyear or more from the date of issuance; and not contain\ncertain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption\namount subject to reduction based on the performance of an\nasset, entity or index, or a similar feature.

The increase was also driven by  Lending commitments within the Wealth Management and  Institutional Securities business segments and an increase in  Equity investments due to higher exposure and market value  gains. In addition, credit risk RWA under the Advanced  Approach increased for CVA, mainly due to increased  exposure in Derivatives and higher credit spread volatility. \nMarket risk RWA increased in 2020 under both the  Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily due to an  increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a result of higher  market volatility. \nG-SIB Capital Surcharge \nWe and other U.S. G-SIBs are subject to a risk-based capital  surcharge. A G-SIB must calculate its G-SIB capital  surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two  surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIB’s size,  interconnected ness, cross-jurisdictional activity, complexity  and subst it ut ability, which is generally consistent with the  methodology developed by the Basel Committee (“Method  1”). The second method uses similar inputs but replaces  subst it ut ability with the use of short-term wholesale funding  (“Method   $2^{\\ast}$  ) and generally results in higher surcharges than  the first method. The G-SIB capital surcharge must be  satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as  an extension of the capital conservation buffer. \nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and  Clean Holding Company Requirements \nThe Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long- term debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements  for top-tier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”),  including the Parent Company. These requirements are  designed to ensure that covered BHCs will have enough loss- absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized  through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise  by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC  where an SPOE resolution strategy is used (see “Business— Supervision and Regulation—Financial Holding Company— Resolution and Recovery Planning” and “Risk Factors— Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risk”). \nThese TLAC and eligible LTD requirements include various  restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to: be issued by  the covered BHC and be unsecured; have a maturity of one  year or more from the date of issuance; and not contain  certain embedded features, such as a principal or redemption  amount subject to reduction based on the performance of an  asset, entity or index, or a similar feature. In addition, the  requirements provide permanent grandfathering for debt  instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be  eligible LTD but for having impermissible acceleration  clauses or being governed by foreign law.  \nA covered BHC is also required to maintain minimum  external TLAC equal to the greater of (i)   $18\\%$   of total RWA  or (ii)   $7.5\\%$   of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of  its SLR). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate  external LTD requirement equal to the greater of (i) total  RWA multiplied by the sum of   $6\\%$   plus the higher of the  Method 1 or Method 2 G-SIB capital surcharge applicable to  the Parent Company, or (ii)   $4.5\\%$   of its total leverage  exposure.  \nThe decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced  Approach in 2020 reflects a decline in the frequency and  severity of litigation-related losses.

In particular, a  firm may, provided that it does not increase the amount of its  common stock dividends to be larger than the level paid in the  second quarter of 2020, pay common stock dividends and  make share repurchases that, in the aggregate, do not exceed  an amount equal to the average of the firm’s net income for  the four preceding calendar quarters; make share repurchases  that equal the amount of share issuances related to expensed  employee compensation; and redeem and make scheduled  payments on additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments. \nAttribution of Average Common Equity According to the  Required Capital Framework \nOur required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based  on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital  adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business  segments is based on capital usage calculated under the  Required Capital framework, as well as each business  segment’s relative contribution to our total Required Capital. \nThe Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage- based capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory  capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern  capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events,  where applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital  allocated to the business segments is generally set at the  beginning of each year and remains fixed throughout the year  until the next annual reset unless a significant business change  occurs ( e.g. , acquisition or disposition). We define the  difference between our total average common equity and the  sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our  business segments as Parent common equity. We generally  hold Parent common equity for prospective regulatory  "}

The Funding IHC would be obligated to\nprovide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material\nentities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution\nstrategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of\nTLAC is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the\nholders of eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible\nTLAC issued by the Parent Company before any losses are\nimposed on creditors of our material entities or before putting\nU.S. taxpayers at risk.\n\n57\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\nThe obligations of the Parent Company and the Funding IHC\nunder the amended and restated support agreement are in\nmost cases secured on a senior basis by the assets of the\nParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the\nParent Company and certain other assets) and the assets of the\nFunding IHC. As a result, claims of our material entities,\nincluding the Funding IHC, with respect to the secured assets,\nare effectively senior to unsecured obligations of the Parent\nCompany.\n\nIn December 2019, we received joint feedback on our 2019\nresolution plan from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The\nfeedback confirmed that there are no deficiencies in our 2019\nresolution plan and that we had successfully addressed a prior\nshortcoming identified by the agencies in the review of our\n2017 resolution plan.

Key central clearinghouses, such as London Clearing\nHouse (“LCH”) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”),\nhave switched their price aligned interest and discounting to\nthe alternative reference rates. For example, the LCH and\nCME transitioned the discounting rate for U.S. dollar\ndenominated products to SOFR, the alternative rate to U.S.\ndollar LIBOR selected by the ARRC. The International\nSwaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) also published\nits 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol which will amend ISDA’s\ninterest rate definitions among Protocol adherents to\nincorporate robust fallbacks for legacy non-cleared\nderivatives linked to LIBOR and certain other interest rates\nbenchmarks.

Similarly, ISDA’s\nIBOR Fallbacks Supplement will also amend ISDA’s\nstandard definitions to incorporate these new fallbacks in new\nderivatives entered into on or after that same effective date.

Firm subsidiaries operating in  non-U.S. markets may participate, or perform customer  facilitation roles, in such non-U.S. facilities or programs. \nOther Matters \nU.K. Withdrawal from the E.U. \nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under  the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and  the E.U. The withdrawal agreement provided for a transition  period to the end of December 2020, during which time the  U.K. continued to apply E.U. law as if it were a member state,  and U.K. firms’ rights to provide financial services in E.U.  member states continued. \nOn December 24, 2020 the U.K. and the E.U. announced they  had reached agreement on the terms of a trade and co- operation agreement to govern the future relationship between  the parties. The agreement consists of three main pillars  including trade, citizens’ security and governance, covering a  range of arrangements in several areas. The agreement is  provisionally applicable with effect from January 1, 2021  pending formal ratification by the E.U. As anticipated, the  agreement did not materially address provision of financial  services. \nWe had prepared the structure of our European operations for  a range of potential outcomes, including for the possibility  that U.K. financial firms’ access to E.U. markets after the  transition period would be limited, and have been able to  continue to serve our clients and customers from January 1,  2021. \nFor more information on the U.K.’s withdrawal from the  E.U., our related preparations and the potential impact on our  operations, see “Risk Factors—International Risk.” For  further information regarding our exposure to the U.K., see  also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk— Country and Other Risks” herein. \nPlanned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate  and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates \nCentral banks around the world, including the Federal  Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups  of market participants and official sector representatives to  replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate  benchmarks (collectively, the “IBORs”). There remains a  likelihood that most IBORs will not be available beyond  2021. In 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, which  administers LIBOR publication, issued a consultation  requesting feedback on its intention to cease the publication  of most LIBOR rates as of the end of December 2021, except  for the publication until June 30, 2023 of the most widely  used U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. At the same time, the U.S.  banking agencies and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority  also encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts  referencing LIBOR as soon as practicable and no later than  December 31, 2021, but have also indicated their support for  the continuation of certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors through  the end of June 2023 to allow for certain U.S. dollar LIBOR  legacy contracts to mature. \nAlso in 2020, there have been several steps taken by the  industry to encourage the transition to alternative reference  rates. Key central clearinghouses, such as London Clearing  House (“LCH”) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”),  have switched their price aligned interest and discounting to  the alternative reference rates. For example, the LCH and  CME transitioned the discounting rate for U.S. dollar  denominated products to SOFR, the alternative rate to U.S.  dollar LIBOR selected by the ARRC. The International  Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) also published  its 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol which will amend ISDA’s  interest rate definitions among Protocol adherents to  incorporate  robust  fallbacks  for  legacy  non-cleared  derivatives linked to LIBOR and certain other interest rates  benchmarks. The ISDA 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol  became effective as of January 25, 2021 and applies to  Protocol adherents who do not elect to voluntarily convert  their derivatives contracts to reference alternative rates in  advance of the applicable cessation date. Similarly, ISDA’s  IBOR Fallbacks Supplement will also amend ISDA’s  standard definitions to incorporate these new fallbacks in new  derivatives entered into on or after that same effective date. In  addition, certain central bank-sponsored committees have  issued recommended best practices to assist market  participants in transitioning away from the IBORs in various  jurisdictions, including the United States. These documents  include recommended timelines and intermediate steps market  participants can take in order to achieve a successful  transition. "}

Further discussion about the  responsibilities of the risk management functions may be  found under “Market Risk,” “Credit Risk,” “Operational  Risk,” “Model Risk” and “Liquidity Risk” herein. \nSupport and Control Groups \nOur support and control groups include the Legal and  Compliance Division, the Finance Division, Technology  Division, Operations Division, the Human Resources  Department, Corporate Services and Firm Resilience. Our  support and control groups coordinate with the business  segment control groups to review the risk monitoring and risk  management policies and procedures relating to, among other  things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; each  business segment’s market, credit and operational risk profile;  liquidity risks; model risks; sales practices; reputational, legal  enforceability, compliance, conduct and regulatory risk; and  technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the  Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that  risk policies and procedures, exceptions to risk limits, new  products and business ventures, and transactions with risk  elements undergo thorough review. \nInternal Audit Department \nThe Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and  control assessment. The Internal Audit Department provides  an independent assessment of the design and effectiveness of  our control environment and risk management processes  using a risk-based audit coverage model and audit execution  methodology developed from professional auditing standards.  The Internal Audit Department also reviews and tests our  compliance with internal guidelines set for risk management  and risk monitoring, as well as external rules and regulations  governing the industry. It undertakes these responsibilities  through periodic reviews (with specified minimum frequency)  of our processes, activities, products and information systems;  targeted reviews of specific controls and activities; pre- implementation or initiative reviews of new or significantly  changed processes, activities, products or information  systems; and special investigations and retrospective reviews  required as a result of internal factors or regulatory requests.  In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Chief Audit  Officer, who reports functionally to the BAC and  administratively to the Chief Executive Officer, periodically  reports to the BRC and BOTC on risk-related control issues. \n\nCulture, Values and Conduct of Employees \nEmployees of the Firm are accountable for conducting  themselves in accordance with our core values:  Put Clients  First, Do the Right Thing, Lead with Exceptional Ideas,  Commit to Diversity and Inclusion and Give Back . We are  committed to reinforcing and confirming adherence to our  core values through our governance framework, tone from the  top, management oversight, risk management and controls,  and three lines of defense structure (business, control  functions such as Risk Management and Compliance, and  Internal Audit). \nThe Board is responsible for overseeing the Firm’s practices  and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct, as set  forth in the Firm’s Corporate Governance Policies. Our  Culture, Values and Conduct Committee, along with the  Compliance and Conduct Risk Committee, are the senior  management committees that oversee the Firmwide culture,  values and conduct program and report regularly to the Board.  A fundamental building block of this program is the Firm’s  Code of Conduct, which establishes standards for employee  conduct that further reinforce the Firm’s commitment to  integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every  employee annually is required to certify to their understanding  of and adherence to the Code of Conduct. The Firm’s Global  Conduct Risk Management Policy also sets out a consistent  global framework for managing Conduct Risk ( i.e. , the risk  arising from misconduct by employees or contingent workers)  and Conduct Risk incidents at the Firm. \nThe employee annual performance review process includes  evaluation of employee conduct related to risk management  practices and the Firm’s expectations. We also have several  mutually reinforcing processes to identify employee conduct  that may have an impact on employment status, current year  compensation and/or prior year compensation. For example,  the Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets  forth  standards  for  managers  when  making  annual  compensation decisions and specifically provides that  managers must consider whether their employees effectively  managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the  performance year. Management committees from control  functions periodically meet to discuss employees whose  conduct is not in line with our expectations. These results are  incorporated into identified employees’ performance reviews  and compensation and promotion decisions. \nThe Firm’s clawback and cancellation provisions apply to  deferred incentive compensation and cover a broad scope of  employee conduct, including any act or omission (including  with respect to direct supervisory responsibilities) that  constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm or causes a  restatement of the Firm’s financial results, constitutes a  violation of the Firm’s global risk management principles,  policies and standards, or causes a loss of revenue associated  with a position on which the employee was paid and the  employee operated outside of internal control policies.

For days where  losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of  trading losses to evaluate the VaR model’s accuracy relative  to realized trading results. There were seven trading loss days  in 2020, one of which exceeded  $95\\%$   Total Management VaR. \nOur regulators have approved the same VaR model we use for  risk management purposes for use in regulatory calculations. \nThe portfolio of positions used for Management VaR differs  from that used for Regulatory VaR. Management VaR  contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory  VaR.  "}

Subsequent credit monitoring for individual loans is  performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are  monitored on an ongoing basis. \nCredit risk metrics assigned to our borrowers during the  evaluation process are incorporated into CRM maintenance of  the allowance for loan losses for loans held for investment.  Such allowance serves as a reserve for probable inherent  losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified as  impaired. For more information on the allowance for loan  losses, see Notes 2 and 10 to the financial statements. \nRisk Mitigation \nWe may seek to mitigate credit risk from our lending and  trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral  provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level,  we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk  elements such as size, tenor, financial covenants, seniority  and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives  exposures. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale  of positions in related securities and financial instruments,  including a variety of derivative products ( e.g. , futures,  forwards, swaps and options). Additionally, we may sell,  assign or syndicate loans and lending commitments to other  financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan  markets. \nIn connection with our derivatives trading activities, we  generally enter into master netting agreements and collateral  arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide  us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate  collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under  the same master agreement in the event of a counterparty  default. A collateral management group monitors collateral  levels against requirements and oversees the administration of  the collateral function. See Note 9 to the financial statements  for  additional  information  about  our  collateralized  transactions. \nThe table shows financial data as of December 31, 2020, and 2019, divided into categories of Institutional Securities, Wealth Management, and Investment Management.

The  collected data elements are incorporated in the operational  risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative  and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario  analysis results are direct inputs to the capital model, while  external operational incidents, business environment and  internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario  analysis process.

In our opinion, the financial statements present  fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the  Firm as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its  operations and its cash flows for each of the three years ended  December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, in conformity with  accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  of America.  \nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the  Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)  (PCAOB), the Firm’s internal control over financial reporting  as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in  Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by  the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway  Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021,  expressed an unqualified opinion on the Firm’s internal  control over financial reporting.  \nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Firm’s  management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on  the Firm’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a  public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are  required to be independent with respect to the Firm in  accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the  applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and  Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of  the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are free of material  misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits  included performing procedures to assess the risks of material  misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error  or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those  risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,  evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the  financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the  accounting principles used and significant estimates made by  management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of  the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a  reasonable basis for our opinion.  \n\nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters  arising from the current-period audit of the financial  statements that were communicated or required to be  communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to  accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial  statements and (2) involved our especially challenging,  subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of  critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on  the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by  communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a  separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the  accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nValuation of Level 3 Financial Assets and Liabilities  Carried at Fair Value — Refer to Note 5 to the financial  statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description \nThe Firm’s trading and financing activities result in the Firm  carrying material financial instruments having limited price  transparency.

As described in Note  5, these Level 3 financial instruments approximate   $\\S18.4$  billion and   $\\S10.2$   billion, respectively, of financial assets and  liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at  December 31, 2020. Unlike financial instruments whose  inputs are readily observable and, therefore, more easily  independently corroborated, the valuation of financial  instruments classified as Level 3 is inherently subjective and  often involves the use of unobservable inputs, as well as  proprietary valuation models whose underlying algorithms  and valuation methodologies are complex. \nWe identified the valuation of Level 3 financial assets and  liabilities carried at fair value as a critical audit matter given  the Firm uses complex valuation models and/or model inputs  that are not observable in the marketplace to determine the  respective fair values. Performing our audit procedures to  evaluate the appropriateness of these models and inputs  involved a high degree of auditor judgment, professionals  with specialized skills and knowledge, and an increased  extent of testing.

Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect assumptions  the Firm believes other market participants would use in  pricing the asset or liability that are developed based on the  best information available in the circumstances. The fair value  hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the  observability of inputs as follows, with Level 1 being the  highest and Level 3 being the lowest level: \nLevel 1.

The same hierarchy for inputs as\ndescribed above, which requires that observable inputs be\nused when available, is used in measuring fair value for these\nitems.\n\nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that\nare measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring\nbasis, see Note 5.\n\nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments\n\nIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally\nenters into master netting agreements and collateral\nagreements with its counterparties. These agreements provide\nthe Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the\ncounterparty, to net a counterparty’s rights and obligations\nunder the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash\ncollateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty.\nDerivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are\nreported net of cash collateral received and posted.\n\nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have\nsuch an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime\nmay not support the enforceability of the master netting\nagreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have\nsought legal advice to support the enforceability of the\nagreement. In cases where the Firm has not determined an\nagreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not\noffset (see Note 7).\n\nThe Firm’s policy is generally to receive cash and/or\nsecurities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation),\nirrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the\nmaster netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the\nFirm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third-\nparty custodian under a control agreement that enables it to\ntake control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty\ndefault. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is\ntaken into account in the Firm’s risk management practices\nand application of counterparty credit limits.\n\nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives, see Note\n7.\n\nHedge Accounting\n\nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative\nfinancial instruments for the following types of hedges:\nhedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due\nto the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations whose functional currency\nis different from the reporting currency of the Parent\nCompany (net investment hedges). These financial\ninstruments are included within Trading assets—Derivative\nand other contracts or Trading liabilities—Derivative and\nother contracts in the balance sheets. For hedges where hedge\naccounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectiveness\ntesting and other procedures.\n\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K\n\n90\n\nMorgan Stanley\nFair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Risk\n\nThe Firm’s designated fair value hedges consist of interest\nrate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark\ninterest rate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and senior\nborrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm also began\ndesignating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes\nin the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits.\nThe Firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the,\ncontractual term of the hedged instrument. The Firm uses\nregression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and\nretrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging\nrelationships. A hedging relationship is deemed effective if\nthe change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative)\nand the change in fair value of the hedged item (AFS security,\ndeposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the\nbenchmark interest rate, offset within a range of 80% to\n125%. The Firm considers the impact of valuation\nadjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own\ncredit spreads to determine whether they would cause the\nhedging relationship to be ineffective.\n\nFor qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates,\nthe change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the\nchange in the fair value attributable to the change in the\nbenchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is\nrecognized in earnings each period as a component of Interest\nincome (expense). For AFS securities, the change in fair value\nof the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being\nhedged will continue to be reported in OCI. When a\nderivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment\nremaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to\nInterest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset\n(liability) using the effective interest method.\n\nNet Investment Hedges\n\nThe Firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage\na portion of the currency exposure relating to its net\ninvestments in foreign operations. To the extent that the\nnotional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion\nof the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange\nrate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the\nexchange rate between the functional currency of the investee\nand the intermediate parent entity’s functional currency, it is\nconsidered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement\nrecognition. The gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net\ninvestments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported\nwithin AOCL. The forward points on the hedging instruments\nare excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in\nthe fair value of this excluded component are recorded\ncurrently in Interest income.\n\nFor further information on derivative instruments and hedging\nactivities, see Note 7.\n\nAES Investment Securities\n\nAFS securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets.\nInterest income, including amortization of premiums and\n", "vlm_text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nvaluation approaches. The same hierarchy for inputs as  described above, which requires that observable inputs be  used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these  items. \nFor further information on financial assets and liabilities that  are measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring  basis, see Note 5. \nOffsetting of Derivative Instruments \nIn connection with its derivative activities, the Firm generally  enters into master netting agreements and collateral  agreements with its counterparties. These agreements provide  the Firm with the right, in the event of a default by the  counterparty, to net a counterparty’s rights and obligations  under the agreement and to liquidate and set off cash  collateral against any net amount owed by the counterparty.  Derivatives with enforceable master netting agreements are  reported net of cash collateral received and posted. \nHowever, in certain circumstances, the Firm may not have  such an agreement in place; the relevant insolvency regime  may not support the enforceability of the master netting  agreement or collateral agreement; or the Firm may not have  sought legal advice to support the enforceability of the  agreement. In cases where the Firm has not determined an  agreement to be enforceable, the related amounts are not  offset (see Note 7). \nThe Firm’s policy is generally to receive cash and/or  securities posted as collateral (with rights of rehypothecation),  irrespective of the enforceability determination regarding the  master netting and collateral agreement. In certain cases, the  Firm may agree for such collateral to be posted to a third- party custodian under a control agreement that enables it to  take control of such collateral in the event of a counterparty  default. The enforceability of the master netting agreement is  taken into account in the Firm’s risk management practices  and application of counterparty credit limits. \nFor information related to offsetting of derivatives, see Note  7. \nHedge Accounting \nThe Firm applies hedge accounting using various derivative  financial instruments for the following types of hedges:  hedges of changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due  to the risk being hedged (fair value hedges); and hedges of net  investments in foreign operations whose functional currency  is different from the reporting currency of the Parent  Company  (net  investment  hedges).  These  financial  instruments are included within Trading assets—Derivative  and other contracts or Trading liabilities—Derivative and  other contracts in the balance sheets. For hedges where hedge  accounting is being applied, the Firm performs effectiveness  testing and other procedures. \nFair Value Hedges—Interest Rate Risk \nThe Firm’s designated fair value hedges consist of interest  rate swaps designated as hedges of changes in the benchmark  interest rate of certain fixed rate AFS securities and senior  borrowings. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Firm also began  designating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of changes  in the benchmark interest rate of certain fixed rate deposits.  The Firm is permitted to hedge the full, or part of the,  contractual term of the hedged instrument. The Firm uses  regression analysis to perform an ongoing prospective and  retrospective assessment of the effectiveness of these hedging  relationships. A hedging relationship is deemed effective if  the change in fair value of the hedging instrument (derivative)  and the change in fair value of the hedged item (AFS security,  deposit liability or borrowing), due to changes in the  benchmark interest rate, offset within a range of   $80\\%$   to   $125\\%$  . The Firm considers the impact of valuation  adjustments related to counterparty credit spreads and its own  credit spreads to determine whether they would cause the  hedging relationship to be ineffective. \nFor qualifying fair value hedges of benchmark interest rates,  the change in the fair value of the derivative, offset by the  change in the fair value attributable to the change in the  benchmark interest rate risk of the hedged asset (liability), is  recognized in earnings each period as a component of Interest  income (expense). For AFS securities, the change in fair value  of the hedged item due to changes other than the risk being  hedged will continue to be reported in OCI. When a  derivative is de-designated as a hedge, any basis adjustment  remaining on the hedged asset (liability) is amortized to  Interest income (expense) over the remaining life of the asset  (liability) using the effective interest method. \nNet Investment Hedges \nThe Firm uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage  a portion of the currency exposure relating to its net  investments in foreign operations. To the extent that the  notional amounts of the hedging instruments equal the portion  of the investments being hedged and the underlying exchange  rate of the derivative hedging instrument is the same as the  exchange rate between the functional currency of the investee  and the intermediate parent entity’s functional currency, it is  considered to be perfectly effective, with no income statement  recognition. The gain or loss from revaluing hedges of net  investments in foreign operations at the spot rate is reported  within AOCI. The forward points on the hedging instruments  are excluded from hedge effectiveness testing and changes in  the fair value of this excluded component are recorded  currently in Interest income. \nFor further information on derivative instruments and hedging  activities, see Note 7. \nAFS Investment Securities \nAFS securities are reported at fair value in the balance sheets.

Principal and interest payments\nreceived on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if\nthere is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of\nprincipal. If collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest\nincome is realized on a cash basis. If the instrument is brought\ncurrent and neither principal or interest collection is in doubt,\ninstruments can generally return to accrual status and interest\nincome can be recognized.\n\nModifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers\nImpacted by COVID-19\n\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm elected to apply the\nguidance issued by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,\nand Economic Security Act (“CARES Act’) as well as by the\nU.S. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted\nto borrowers that are current on existing loans, either\nindividually or as part of a program for creditworthy\nborrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or\noperational problems as a result of COVID-19, generally\nwould not be considered TDRs. Additionally, these loans\ngenerally would not be considered nonaccrual unless\ncollectability concerns exist despite the modification\nprovided. For loans remaining on accrual status, the Firm\nelected to continue recognizing interest income during the\nmodification periods.\n\nACL Charge-offs\n\nThe principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off\nin the period it is deemed uncollectible resulting in a\nreduction in the ACL and the balance of the financial\ninstrument in the balance sheet.

However, in the case of loans\nthat are modified as a result of COVID-19 and remain on\naccrual status due to the relief noted in “Modifications and\nNonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19”\nherein, accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for\nany required ACL.\n\nTransfers of Financial Assets\n\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when\nthe Firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets.\nAny related gain or loss on sale is recorded in Net revenues.\nTransfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as\ncollateralized financings.

The table consists of three main categories:\n\n1. **Instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g., HFI loans, HTM securities, and customer and other receivables):**\n   - **ACL:** Contra asset\n   - **Provision for Credit Losses:** Other revenue\n\n2. **Employee loans:**\n   - **ACL:** Contra asset\n   - **Provision for Credit Losses:** Compensation and benefits expense\n\n3. **Off-balance sheet instruments (e.g., HFI lending commitments and certain guarantees):**\n   - **ACL:** Other liabilities and accrued expenses\n   - **Provision for Credit Losses:** Other expense\n\nEach row specifies the type of instrument or loan, how its ACL is recorded, and what category its provision for credit losses falls under.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings “TDRs” \nThe Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic  or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties  by granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not  otherwise consider. Such modifications are accounted for and  reported as a TDR, except for certain modifications related to  the Coronavirus Disease (“COVID-19”) as noted in  “Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers  Impacted by COVID-19” herein. A loan that has been  modified in a TDR is generally considered to be impaired and  is evaluated individually. TDRs are also generally classified  as nonaccrual and may be returned to accrual status only after  the Firm expects repayment of the remaining contractual  principal and interest and there is sustained repayment  performance for a reasonable period.  \nNonaccrual \nThe Firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if  principal or interest is not expected when contractually due or  is past due for a period of 90 days or more unless the  obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection. For  borrowers impacted by COVID-19, see “Modifications and  Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19”  herein for additional considerations.  \n\nFor any instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the Firm  reverses any unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting  reduction to Interest income. Principal and interest payments  received on nonaccrual instruments are applied to principal if  there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of  principal. If collection of the principal is not in doubt, interest  income is realized on a cash basis. If the instrument is brought  current and neither principal or interest collection is in doubt,  instruments can generally return to accrual status and interest  income can be recognized.  \nModifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers  Impacted by COVID-19 \nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm elected to apply the  guidance issued by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,  and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) as well as by the  U.S. banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted  to borrowers that are current on existing loans, either  individually or as part of a program for creditworthy  borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or  operational problems as a result of COVID-19, generally  would not be considered TDRs. Additionally, these loans  generally would not be considered nonaccrual unless  collectability concerns exist despite the modification  provided. For loans remaining on accrual status, the Firm  elected to continue recognizing interest income during the  modification periods. \nACL Charge-offs \nThe principal balance of a financial instrument is charged off  in the period it is deemed uncollectible resulting in a  reduction in the ACL and the balance of the financial  instrument in the balance sheet. Accrued interest receivable  balances that are separately recorded from the related  financial instruments are charged off against Interest income  when the related financial instrument is placed on nonaccrual.  Accordingly, the Firm elected not to measure an ACL for  accrued interest receivables. However, in the case of loans  that are modified as a result of COVID-19 and remain on  accrual status due to the relief noted in “Modifications and  Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19”  herein, accrued interest receivable balances are assessed for  any required ACL. \nTransfers of Financial Assets \nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when  the Firm has relinquished control over the transferred assets.  Any related gain or loss on sale is recorded in Net revenues.  Transfers that are not accounted for as sales are treated as  collateralized financings.

CECL replaced the incurred loss model\npreviously applicable to loans held for investment, HTM\nsecurities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such\nas employee loans.\n\nThe update also eliminated the concept of other-than-\ntemporary impairment for AFS securities and instead requires\nimpairments on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings\nthrough an allowance when the fair value is less than\namortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a\npermanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the\nsecurities are expected to be sold before recovery of\namortized cost.\n\nAt transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this\naccounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses of $131 million with a corresponding\nreduction in Retained earnings of $100 million, net of tax.\nThe adoption impact was primarily attributable to a\n$124 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on\nemployee loans.\n", "vlm_text": "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \nIncome Taxes \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon the  temporary differences between the financial statement and  income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently  enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences  are expected to reverse.

The optional relief generally allows  for contract modifications solely related to the replacement of  the reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the  existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the  contract and would therefore not trigger certain accounting  impacts that would otherwise be required. It also allows  entities to change certain critical terms of existing hedge  accounting relationships that are affected by reference rate  reform, and these changes would not require de-designating  the hedge accounting relationship. The optional relief ends  December 31, 2022. \nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses \nThe Firm has adopted the Financial Instruments—Credit  Losses.  \nThis accounting update impacted the impairment model for  certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by  requiring a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit  losses over the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at  inception or purchase. CECL replaced the incurred loss model  previously applicable to loans held for investment, HTM  securities and other receivables carried at amortized cost, such  as employee loans. \nThe update also eliminated the concept of other-than- temporary impairment for AFS securities and instead requires  impairments on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings  through an allowance when the fair value is less than  amortized cost and a credit loss exists, and through a  permanent reduction of the amortized cost basis when the  securities are expected to be sold before recovery of  amortized cost. \nAt transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this  accounting standard resulted in an increase in the allowance  for credit losses of   $\\S131$   million with a corresponding  reduction in Retained earnings of   $\\S100$   million, net of tax.  The adoption impact was primarily attributable to a   $\\S124$   million increase in the allowance for credit losses on  employee loans. "}

It is divided into three main sections:\n\n1. **Fair value hedges—Recognized in Interest income:**\n   - **Interest rate contracts:** In 2020, there is a $75 million gain, compared to losses of $10 million in 2019 and $4 million in 2018.\n   - **Investment Securities—AFS:** In 2020, there is a $33 million loss, while 2019 shows a $10 million gain and 2018 a $4 million gain.\n\n2. **Fair value hedges—Recognized in Interest expense:**\n   - **Interest rate contracts:** In 2020, an expense of $4,678 million is recognized, which increased from $4,212 million in 2019 and differed significantly from the positive $1,529 million in 2018.\n   - **Deposits:** In 2020, there is a $100 million loss, compared to a $7 million gain in 2019 and no data for 2018.\n   - **Borrowings:** In 2020, there is a $4,692 million expense, more than $4,288 million in 2019, with a positive recognition of $1,511 million in 2018.\n\n3. **Net investment hedges—Foreign exchange contracts:**\n   - **Recognized in OCI (Other Comprehensive Income):** Shows a $366 million loss in 2020, compared to a $14 million gain in 2019 and a $295 million gain in 2018.\n   - **Forward points excluded from hedge effectiveness testing—Recognized in Interest income:** In 2020, $16 million is recognized, compared to $136 million in 2019 and $68 million in 2018.\n\nFootnotes or additional notes within the table include a reference number [1] that indicates there may be further relevant information or notes attached that are not visible in the image provided.\nderivative contracts that contain credit risk-related contingent  features that are in a net liability position for which the Firm  has posted collateral in the normal course of business. \nThe table provides information related to downgrade scenarios as of December 31, 2020. The values are expressed in millions of dollars. It shows:\n\n- A one-notch downgrade scenario with an associated value of $316 million.\n- A two-notch downgrade scenario with an associated value of $134 million.\n- The value of bilateral downgrade agreements included in the amounts stated above totals $352 million.\nThe additional collateral or termination payments that may be  called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by  contract and can be based on ratings by either or both of  Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P Global Ratings.

Investment grade/non-investment grade determination is based on the internal\ncredit rating of the reference obligation. Internal credit ratings serve as the Credit\nRisk Management Department's assessment of credit risk and the basis for a\ncomprehensive credit limits framework used to control credit risk. The Firm uses\nquantitative models and judgment to estimate the various risk parameters related to\neach obligor.\n\n113\n\nThe Firm enters into credit derivatives, principally CDS,\nunder which it receives or provides protection against the risk\nof default on a set of debt obligations issued by a specified\nreference entity or entities.

The Firm manages its exposure to these\nderivative contracts through a variety of risk mitigation\nstrategies, which include managing the credit and correlation\nrisk across single-name, non-tranched indices and baskets,\ntranched indices and baskets, and cash positions. Aggregate\nmarket risk limits have been established for credit derivatives,\nand market risk measures are routinely monitored against\nthese limits. The Firm may also recover amounts on the\nunderlying reference obligation delivered to the Firm under\nCDS where credit protection was sold.\n\nSingle-Name CDS. | A CDS protects the buyer against the\nloss of principal on a bond or loan in case of a default by the\nissuer. The protection buyer pays a periodic premium\n(generally quarterly) over the life of the contract and is\nprotected for the period. The Firm, in turn, performs under a\nCDS if a credit event as defined under the contract occurs.\nTypical credit events include bankruptcy, dissolution or\ninsolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay and\nrestructuring of the obligations of the referenced entity.\n\nIndex and Basket CDS.

The data is presented in millions of dollars.\n\n1. **Currently employed by the Firm:**\n   - For 2020: $3,100 million\n   - For 2019: Not available (N/A)\n\n2. **No longer employed by the Firm:**\n   - For 2020: $140 million\n   - For 2019: Not available (N/A)\n\n3. **Employee loans:**\n   - For 2020: $3,240 million\n   - For 2019: $2,980 million\n\n4. **ACL (Allowance for Credit Losses):**\n   - For 2020: -$165 million\n   - For 2019: -$61 million\n\n5. **Employee loans, net of ACL:**\n   - For 2020: $3,075 million\n   - For 2019: $2,919 million\n\n6. **Remaining repayment term, weighted average in years:**\n   - For 2020: 5.3 years\n   - For 2019: 4.8 years\n\nThe data reflects changes in employee loans and the allowance for credit losses from one year to the next, including information about whether the employees are still with the firm or not. The table also includes the remaining average repayment term for these loans.\nEmployee loans are granted in conjunction with a program  established primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management  representatives, are full recourse and generally require  periodic repayments, and are due in full upon termination of  employment with the Firm. These loans are recorded in  Customer and other receivables in the balance sheets. The  ACL as of December 31, 2020 was calculated under the  CECL methodology, while the ACL at December 31, 2019  was calculated under the prior incurred loss model. The  related provision is recorded in Compensation and benefits  expense in the income statements. See Note 2 for a  description of the CECL allowance methodology, including  credit quality indicators, for employee loans. \n11.

Senior debt also may  be structured to be callable by the Firm or extendible at the  option of holders of the senior debt securities. \nThe Firm’s Borrowings include notes carried and managed on  a fair value basis. These include instruments whose payments  and redemption values are linked to the performance of a  specific index, a basket of stocks, a specific equity security, a  commodity, a credit exposure or basket of credit exposures;  and instruments with various interest-rate-related features,  including step-ups, step-downs and zero coupons. To  minimize the exposure from such instruments, the Firm has  entered into various swap contracts and purchased options  that effectively convert the borrowing costs into floating rates.  The swaps and purchased options used to economically hedge  the embedded features are derivatives and also are carried at  fair value. Changes in fair value related to the notes and  economic hedges are reported in Trading revenues. See Notes  "}

Certain derivative contracts meet the\naccounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written\noptions, contingent forward contracts and CDS (see Note 7\nregarding credit derivatives in which the Firm has sold credit\nprotection to the counterparty). All derivative contracts that\ncould meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are\nincluded in the previous table, with the notional amount used\nas the maximum potential payout for certain derivative\ncontracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign\ncurrency options. The Firm evaluates collateral requirements\nfor all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the\naccounting definition of a guarantee. For the effects of cash\ncollateral and counterparty netting, see Note 7.\n\nIn certain situations, collateral may be held by the Firm for\nthose contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee.\nGenerally, the Firm sets collateral requirements by\n\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K\n\n126\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\ncounterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions\nand products and is not allocated specifically to individual\ncontracts.

In connection with its corporate lending business and\nother corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such\narrangements represent obligations to make payments to third\nparties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a\nborrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A\nmajority of the Firm’s standby letters of credit are provided\non behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. If the\ncounterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm\nhas access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its\nobligation.\n\nMarket Value Guarantees.

The Firm has entered into liquidity\nfacilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the\nFirm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults\noccur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity provider to\nmunicipal bond securitization SPEs and for standalone\nmunicipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests\nissued by these SPEs or the holders of the individual bonds,\nrespectively, have the right to tender their interests for\npurchase by the Firm on specified dates at a specified price.\nThe Firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets\nheld by the SPEs in the event payments are required under\nsuch liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse\nprovisions with the trust sponsors. The recourse amount often\nexceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the\nguarantee. Substantially all of the underlying assets in the\nSPEs are investment grade. Liquidity facilities provided to\nmunicipal tender option bond trusts are classified as\nderivatives.\n\nWhole Loan Sales Guarantees. The Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and\nwarranties regarding certain whole loan sales.

It’s divided into sections for:\n\n1. **Categories (with subtotals for years to maturity)**:\n   - Credit derivatives\n   - Other credit contracts\n   - Non-credit derivatives\n   - Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees issued\n   - Market value guarantees\n   - Liquidity facilities\n   - Whole loan sales guarantees\n   - Securitization representations and warranties\n   - General partner guarantees\n   - Client clearing guarantees\n\n2. **Years to Maturity**:\n   - Less than 1 year\n   - 1-3 years\n   - 3-5 years\n   - Over 5 years\n   - Total\n\n3. **Carrying Amount (Asset/Liability)** for each category.\n\nThe table includes specific amounts under each maturity category and totals, as well as the carrying amount for each financial instrument.\nTypes of Guarantees \nDerivative Contracts.  Certain derivative contracts meet the  accounting definition of a guarantee, including certain written  options, contingent forward contracts and CDS (see Note 7  regarding credit derivatives in which the Firm has sold credit  protection to the counterparty). All derivative contracts that  could meet this accounting definition of a guarantee are  included in the previous table, with the notional amount used  as the maximum potential payout for certain derivative  contracts, such as written interest rate caps and written foreign  currency options. The Firm evaluates collateral requirements  for all derivatives, including derivatives that do not meet the  accounting definition of a guarantee. For the effects of cash  collateral and counterparty netting, see Note 7. \nIn certain situations, collateral may be held by the Firm for  those contracts that meet the definition of a guarantee.  Generally, the Firm sets collateral requirements by  counterparty so that the collateral covers various transactions  and products and is not allocated specifically to individual  contracts. Also, the Firm may recover amounts related to the  underlying asset delivered to the Firm under the derivative  contract. \n\nStandby Letters of Credit and Other Financial Guarantees  Issued.  In connection with its corporate lending business and  other corporate activities, the Firm provides standby letters of  credit and other financial guarantees to counterparties. Such  arrangements represent obligations to make payments to third  parties if the counterparty fails to fulfill its obligation under a  borrowing arrangement or other contractual obligation. A  majority of the Firm’s standby letters of credit are provided  on behalf of counterparties that are investment grade. If the  counterparty fails to fulfill its contractual obligation, the Firm  has access to collateral or recourse that would approximate its  obligation. \nMarket Value Guarantees.  Market value guarantees are issued  to guarantee timely payment of a specified return to investors  in certain affordable housing tax credit funds. These  guarantees are designed to return an investor’s contribution to  a fund and the investor’s share of tax losses and tax credits  expected to be generated by a fund. \nLiquidity Facilities.  The Firm has entered into liquidity  facilities with SPEs and other counterparties, whereby the  Firm is required to make certain payments if losses or defaults  occur. Primarily, the Firm acts as liquidity provider to  municipal bond securitization SPEs and for standalone  municipal bonds in which the holders of beneficial interests  issued by these SPEs or the holders of the individual bonds,  respectively, have the right to tender their interests for  purchase by the Firm on specified dates at a specified price.  The Firm often may have recourse to the underlying assets  held by the SPEs in the event payments are required under  such liquidity facilities, as well as make-whole or recourse  provisions with the trust sponsors. The recourse amount often  exceeds the maximum potential payout amount of the  guarantee. Substantially all of the underlying assets in the  SPEs are investment grade. Liquidity facilities provided to  municipal tender option bond trusts are classified as  derivatives. \nWhole Loan Sales Guarantees.  The Firm has provided, or  otherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and  warranties regarding certain whole loan sales. Under certain  circumstances, the Firm may be required to repurchase such  assets or make other payments related to such assets if such  representations and warranties are breached. The Firm’s  maximum potential payout related to such representations and  warranties is equal to the current UPB of such loans. Since the  Firm no longer services these loans, it has no information on  the current UPB of those loans, and accordingly, the amount  included in the previous table represents the UPB at the time  of the whole loan sale or at the time when the Firm last  serviced any of those loans. The current UPB balances could  be substantially lower than the maximum potential payout  "}

As part of the\nFirm’s Institutional Securities business  segment’s\nsecuritizations and related activities, the Firm has provided, or\notherwise agreed to be responsible for, representations and\nwarranties regarding certain assets transferred in\nsecuritization transactions sponsored by the Firm. The extent\nand nature of the representations and warranties, if any, vary\namong different securitizations. Under certain circumstances,\nthe Firm may be required to repurchase certain assets or make\nother payments related to such assets if such representations\nand warranties are breached.

The amount included in the\nprevious table for the maximum potential payout includes the\ncurrent UPB or historical losses where known, and the UPB at\nthe time of sale when the current UPB is not known.\n\nGeneral Partner Guarantees. As a general partner in certain\ninvestment management funds, the Firm receives certain\ndistributions from the partnerships when the return exceeds\nspecified performance targets according to the provisions of\nthe partnership agreements. The Firm may be required to\nreturn all or a portion of such distributions to the limited\npartners in the event the limited partners do not achieve a\ncertain return as specified in the various partnership\nagreements, subject to certain limitations.\n\nClient Clearing Guarantees. In 2019, the Firm became a\nsponsoring member of the Government Securities Division of\nthe FICC's Sponsored Clearing Model. Clients of the Firm, as\nsponsored members, can transact in overnight securities\nrepurchase and resale agreements, which are cleared through\nthe FICC. As sponsoring member, the Firm guarantees to the\nFICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its\nclients’ obligations. In 2020, the FICC’s sponsored clearing\nmodel was updated such that the Firm could be responsible\nfor liquidation of a sponsored member’s account and\nguarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the\nsponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation\namount due from the sponsored member to the FICC.\nAccordingly, the Firm’s maximum potential payout amount\nreflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for\nsponsored member accounts. The Firm minimizes credit\nexposure under this guarantee by obtaining a security interest\nin its sponsored member clients’ collateral and their\ncontractual rights under sponsored member transactions.\nTherefore, the Firm's exposure is estimated to be an amount\nsubstantially lower than the maximum potential payout\namount.

The Firm provides standard indemnities to\ncounterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes,\nincluding U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest\nand other payments made on derivatives, securities and\nstock lending transactions, certain annuity products and\nother financial arrangements. These indemnity payments\ncould be required based on a change in the tax laws, a\nchange in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a\nchange in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain\nprovisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement\nupon the occurrence of such events. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments that the Firm could be\nrequired to make under these indemnifications cannot be\nestimated.\n\n+ Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees. The Firm is\na member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that\ntrade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts.\nAssociated with its membership, the Firm may be required\nto pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or\nthe clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members\nor pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of\nanother member that may default on its obligations to the\nexchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing\ndifferent exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the\nforms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm’s\nobligations under these rules would arise only if the\nexchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its\nresources.\n\nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to\nassume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the\nclearinghouse’s investment of guarantee fund contributions\nand initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the\ndefault of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the\nspecified resources allocated for such purpose by the\nclearinghouse.\n\nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be\nestimated. The Firm has not recorded any contingent\nliability in its financial statements for these agreements and\nbelieves that any potential requirement to make payments\nunder these agreements is remote.\n\n* Merger and Acquisition Guarantees. The Firm may, from\ntime to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be\nrequired to provide guarantees in connection with certain\nEuropean merger and acquisition transactions.

The collateral amount in which the Firm has a  security interest is approximately equal to the maximum  potential payout amount of the guarantee. \nOther Guarantees and Indemnities \nIn the normal course of business, the Firm provides  guarantees and indemnifications in a variety of transactions.  These provisions generally are standard contractual terms.  Certain of these guarantees and indemnifications are  described below:\n\n \n• Indemnities . The Firm provides standard indemnities to  counterparties for certain contingent exposures and taxes,  including U.S. and foreign withholding taxes, on interest  and other payments made on derivatives, securities and  stock lending transactions, certain annuity products and  other financial arrangements. These indemnity payments  could be required based on a change in the tax laws, a  change in interpretation of applicable tax rulings or a  change in factual circumstances. Certain contracts contain  provisions that enable the Firm to terminate the agreement  upon the occurrence of such events. The maximum  potential amount of future payments that the Firm could be  required to make under these indemnifications cannot be  estimated.\n\n \n• Exchange/Clearinghouse Member Guarantees.  The Firm is  a member of various exchanges and clearinghouses that  trade and clear securities and/or derivative contracts.  Associated with its membership, the Firm may be required  to pay a certain amount as determined by the exchange or  the clearinghouse in case of a default of any of its members  or pay a proportionate share of the financial obligations of  another member that may default on its obligations to the  exchange or the clearinghouse. While the rules governing  different exchange or clearinghouse memberships and the  forms of these guarantees may vary, in general the Firm’s  obligations under these rules would arise only if the  exchange or clearinghouse had previously exhausted its  resources. \nIn addition, some clearinghouse rules require members to  assume a proportionate share of losses resulting from the  clearinghouse’s investment of guarantee fund contributions  and initial margin, and of other losses unrelated to the  default of a clearing member, if such losses exceed the  specified resources allocated for such purpose by the  clearinghouse. \nThe maximum potential payout under these rules cannot be  estimated. The Firm has not recorded any contingent  liability in its financial statements for these agreements and  believes that any potential requirement to make payments  under these agreements is remote.\n\n \n• Merger and Acquisition Guarantees.  The Firm may, from  time to time, in its role as investment banking advisor be  required to provide guarantees in connection with certain  European merger and acquisition transactions.

The complaint seeks compensatory\ndamages related to the approximately $228 million that CDIB\nalleges it has already lost under the CDS, rescission of\nCDIB’s obligation to pay an additional $12 million, punitive\ndamages, equitable relief, fees and costs. On February 28,\n2011, the court denied the Firm’s motion to dismiss the\ncomplaint.

The values are in millions of dollars. \n\n1. **Residential Mortgages:**\n   - At December 31, 2020:\n     - UPB: $17,775 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $3,175 million\n   - At December 31, 2019:\n     - UPB: $30,353 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $3,993 million\n\n2. **Commercial Mortgages:**\n   - At December 31, 2020:\n     - UPB: $62,093 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $4,131 million\n   - At December 31, 2019:\n     - UPB: $53,892 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $3,881 million\n\n3. **U.S. Agency Collateralized Mortgage Obligations:**\n   - At December 31, 2020:\n     - UPB: $99,182 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $17,224 million\n   - At December 31, 2019:\n     - UPB: $36,366 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $6,365 million\n\n4. **Other Consumer or Commercial Loans:**\n   - At December 31, 2020:\n     - UPB: $5,103 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $1,717 million\n   - At December 31, 2019:\n     - UPB: $4,992 million\n     - Debt and Equity Interests: $2,075 million\n\n**Total:**\n- At December 31, 2020:\n  - UPB: $184,153 million\n  - Debt and Equity Interests: $26,247 million\n- At December 31, 2019:\n  - UPB: $125,603 million\n  - Debt and Equity Interests: $16,314 million\nSecuritization Activities \nIn a securitization transaction, the Firm transfers assets  (generally commercial or residential mortgage loans or  securities) to an SPE, sells to investors most of the beneficial  interests, such as notes or certificates, issued by the SPE, and,  in many cases, retains other beneficial interests. The purchase  of the transferred assets by the SPE is financed through the  sale of these interests. \nIn many securitization transactions involving commercial  mortgage loans, the Firm transfers a portion of the assets to  the SPE with unrelated parties transferring the remaining  assets. In addition, mainly in securitization transactions  involving residential mortgage loans, the Firm may also enter  into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps or  interest rate caps, with the SPE. \nAlthough not obligated, the Firm generally makes a market in  the securities issued by SPEs in securitization transactions. As  a market maker, the Firm offers to buy these securities from,  and sell these securities to, investors. Securities purchased  through these market-making activities are not considered to  be retained interests; these beneficial interests generally are  included in Trading assets—Corporate and other debt and are  measured at fair value. \nThe Firm enters into derivatives, generally interest rate swaps  and interest rate caps, with a senior payment priority in many  securitization transactions. The risks associated with these and  similar derivatives with SPEs are essentially the same as  similar derivatives with non-SPE counterparties and are  "}

Liquidity facilities\nprovided to municipal tender option bond trusts are classified\nas derivatives. The Firm consolidates any municipal tender\noption bond trusts in which it holds the residual interest.\n\nCredit Protection Purchased through Credit-Linked Notes\n\nCLN transactions are designed to provide investors with\nexposure to certain credit risk on referenced assets. In these\ntransactions, the Firm transfers assets (generally high-quality\nsecurities or money market investments) to an SPE, enters\ninto a derivative transaction in which the SPE sells protection\non an unrelated referenced asset or group of assets, through a\ncredit derivative, and sells the securities issued by the SPE to\ninvestors. In some transactions, the Firm may also enter into\ninterest rate or currency swaps with the SPE.

The\ninterests entitle the Firm to a share of tax credits and tax\nlosses generated by these projects. In addition, the Firm has\nissued guarantees to investors in certain low-income housing\nfunds. The guarantees are designed to return an investor’s\ncontribution to a fund and the investor’s share of tax losses\nand tax credits expected to be generated by the fund. The\nFirm is also involved with entities designed to provide tax-\nefficient yields to the Firm or its clients.\n\nCollateralized Loan and Debt Obligations\n\nCLOs and CDOs are SPEs that purchase a pool of assets\nconsisting of corporate loans, corporate bonds, ABS or\nsynthetic exposures on similar assets through derivatives, and\nissue multiple tranches of debt and equity securities to\ninvestors. The Firm underwrites the securities issued in\ncertain CLO transactions on behalf of unaffiliated sponsors\nand provides advisory services to these unaffiliated sponsors.\nThe Firm sells corporate loans to many of these SPEs, in\nsome cases representing a significant portion of the total\nassets purchased.

The OCC establishes similar capital\nrequirements and standards for the Firm’s U.S. bank\nsubsidiaries including, among others, MSBNA and\nMSPBNA.

A summary of the calculations of regulatory\ncapital and RWA follows.\n\nMinimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to\nCommon Equity Tier | capital, Tier 1 capital and Total\ncapital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards\nrequire certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital\nfor purposes of determining these ratios.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule,\nconsistent with an interim final rule that was effective March\n31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules,\nthe required adoption time period for CECL.

Required ratios represent the regulatory minimum plus the capital buffer\nrequirement.\n\nRisk-Weighted Assets\n\nRWA reflects both the Firm’s on- and off-balance sheet risk,\nas well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss\narising from the following:\n\n* Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or\nissuer to meet its financial obligations to the Firm;\n\n+ Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more\nmarket prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or\nother market factors, such as market liquidity; and\n\n* Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems,\nfrom human factors or from external events (e.g., fraud,\ntheft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage\nto physical assets).\n\nThe Firm’s risk-based capital ratios are computed under both\n(i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and\nmarket risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) and (ii) the\napplicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk,\nmarket risk and operational risk RWA_ (“Advanced\nApproach”). The credit risk RWA calculations between the\ntwo approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach\nrequires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights,\nwhereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate\nexposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2020\nand December 31, 2019, the differences between the actual\nand required ratio were lower under the Standardized\nApproach.\n\nMinimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier\n1 leverage ratio and an SLR.

The OCC establishes similar capital  requirements and standards for the Firm’s U.S. bank  subsidiaries  including,  among  others,  MSBNA  and  MSPBNA. The regulatory capital requirements are largely  based on the Basel III capital standards established by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and also implement  certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and  Consumer Protection Act. \nRegulatory Capital Requirements \nThe Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and  leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital  requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory  capital and RWA follows. \nMinimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to  Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total  capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards  require certain adjustments to, and deductions from, capital  for purposes of determining these ratios. \nIn 2020, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule,  consistent with an interim final rule that was effective March  31, 2020, altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital rules,  the required adoption time period for CECL. As of December  31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital amounts  and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and  supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the  effect of the adoption of CECL based on the Firm’s election  to defer this effect over a five-year transition period in  accordance with the interim final rule.  \nThe table shows capital buffer requirements for different periods and methodologies, specifically at December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The table is broken down into several categories related to capital buffers:\n\n1. **Capital Conservation Buffer**:\n   - December 31, 2020:\n     - Standardized: Not applicable (—)\n     - Advanced: 2.5%\n   - December 31, 2019:\n     - Standardized and Advanced: 2.5%\n\n2. **Stress Capital Buffer (SCB)**:\n   - December 31, 2020:\n     - Standardized: 5.7%\n     - Advanced: Not applicable (N/A)\n   - December 31, 2019:\n     - Standardized and Advanced: Not applicable (N/A)\n\n3. **G-SIB Capital Surcharge**:\n   - December 31, 2020:\n     - Standardized: 3.0%\n     - Advanced: 3.0%\n   - December 31, 2019:\n     - Standardized and Advanced: 3.0%\n\n4. **CCyB (Countercyclical Capital Buffer)**:\n   - December 31, 2020:\n     - Standardized: 0%\n     - Advanced: 0%\n   - December 31, 2019:\n     - Standardized and Advanced: 0%\n\n5. **Capital Buffer Requirement**:\n   - December 31, 2020:\n     - Standardized: 8.7%\n     - Advanced: 5.5%\n   - December 31, 2019:\n     - Standardized and Advanced: 5.5%\n\nIn summary, this table provides a snapshot of the required capital buffers for specified periods and regulatory approaches (Standardized and Advanced).\nThe table displays different capital ratios required by regulatory standards, comparing them under different frameworks: Regulatory Minimum, Standardized, Advanced, and a combined Standardized and Advanced category.\n\n- **Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio**:\n  - Regulatory Minimum: 4.5%\n  - Standardized: 13.2%\n  - Advanced: 10.0%\n  - Standardized and Advanced: 10.0%\n\n- **Tier 1 Capital Ratio**:\n  - Regulatory Minimum: 6.0%\n  - Standardized: 14.7%\n  - Advanced: 11.5%\n  - Standardized and Advanced: 11.5%\n\n- **Total Capital Ratio**:\n  - Regulatory Minimum: 8.0%\n  - Standardized: 16.7%\n  - Advanced: 13.5%\n  - Standardized and Advanced: 13.5%\n\nIn summary, the table shows the minimum required regulatory capital ratios and the corresponding ratios under different risk assessment standards.\nRisk-Weighted Assets \nRWA reflects both the Firm’s on- and off-balance sheet risk,  as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss  arising from the following:\n\n \n• Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or  issuer to meet its financial obligations to the Firm;\n\n • Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more  market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or  other market factors, such as market liquidity; and\n\n • Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems,  from human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud,  theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage  to physical assets). \nThe Firm’s risk-based capital ratios are computed under both  (i) the standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and  market risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) and (ii) the  applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk,  market risk and operational risk RWA (“Advanced  Approach”). The credit risk RWA calculations between the  two approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach  requires calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights,  whereas the Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate  exposure amounts and risk weights. At December 31, 2020  and December 31, 2019, the differences between the actual  and required ratio were lower under the Standardized  Approach. \nMinimum leverage-based capital requirements include a Tier  1 leverage ratio and an SLR.

The longer-duration fixed income\nallocation is expected to help protect the plan’s funded status\nand maintain the stability of plan contributions over the long\nrun. The investment portfolio performance is assessed by\ncomparing actual investment performance with changes in the\nestimated present value of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s benefit\nobligation.\n\nDerivative instruments are permitted in the U.S. Qualified\nPlan’s investment portfolio only to the extent that they\ncomply with all of the plan’s investment policy guidelines and\nare consistent with the plan’s risk and return objectives.\n\nAs a fundamental operating principle, any restrictions on the\nunderlying assets apply to the respective derivative product.\nThis includes percentage allocations and credit quality.\nDerivatives are used solely for the purpose of enhancing\n\n143\n\nMorgan Stanley\n\ninvestment returns in the underlying assets and not to\ncircumvent portfolio restrictions.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value using valuation\ntechniques that are consistent with the valuation techniques\napplied to the Firm’s major categories of assets and liabilities\nas described in Notes 2 and 5. OTC derivative contracts\nconsist of investments in interest rate swaps and total return\nswaps. Other investments consist of pledged insurance\nannuity contracts held by non-U.S.-based plans. The pledged\ninsurance annuity contracts are valued based on the premium\nreserve of the insurer for a guarantee that the insurer has\ngiven to the employee benefit plan that approximates fair\nvalue. The pledged insurance annuity contracts are\ncategorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nCommingled trust funds are privately offered funds regulated,\nsupervised and subject to periodic examination by a U.S.\nfederal or state agency and available to institutional clients.\nThe trust must be maintained for the collective investment or\nreinvestment of assets contributed to it from U.S. tax-\nqualified employee benefit plans maintained by more than one\nemployer or controlled group of corporations. The sponsor of\nthe commingled trust funds values the funds based on the fair\nvalue of the underlying securities. Commingled trust funds\nare redeemable at NAV at the measurement date or in the near\nfuture.\n\nSome non-U.S.-based plans hold foreign funds that consist of\ninvestments in fixed income funds, target cash flow funds and\nliquidity funds. Fixed income funds invest in individual\nsecurities quoted on a recognized stock exchange or traded in\na regulated market. Certain fixed income funds aim to\nproduce returns consistent with certain Financial Times Stock\nExchange indexes. Target cash flow funds are designed to\nprovide a series of fixed annual cash flows achieved by\ninvesting in government bonds and derivatives. Liquidity\nfunds place a high priority on capital preservation, stable\nvalue and a high liquidity of assets. Foreign funds are readily\nredeemable at NAV.\n\nThe Firm generally considers the NAV of commingled trust\nfunds and foreign funds provided by the fund manager to be\nthe best estimate of fair value.\n\nExpected Contributions\n\nThe Firm’s policy is to fund at least the amount sufficient to\nmeet minimum funding requirements under applicable\nemployee benefit and tax laws. At December 31, 2020, the\nFirm expected to contribute approximately $50 million to its\npension plans in 2021 based upon the plans’ current funded\nstatus and expected asset return assumptions for 2021.\n\nDecember 2020 Form 10-K\n", "vlm_text": "The table provides a breakdown of different financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

Here's a breakdown of the information in the table:\n\n- **Balance at beginning of period**: \n  - 2020: $755 million\n  - 2019: $1,080 million\n  - 2018: $1,594 million\n\n- **Increase based on tax positions related to the current period**: \n  - 2020: $139 million\n  - 2019: $57 million\n  - 2018: $83 million\n\n- **Increase based on tax positions related to prior periods**: \n  - 2020: $178 million\n  - 2019: $61 million\n  - 2018: $34 million\n\n- **Increase based on the acquisition of E*TRADE**: \n  - 2020: $26 million\n  - 2019: Not applicable (\"—\")\n  - 2018: Not applicable (\"—\")\n\n- **Decrease based on tax positions related to prior periods**: \n  - 2020: ($297 million)\n  - 2019: ($419 million)\n  - 2018: ($404 million)\n\n- **Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities**: \n  - 2020: ($36 million)\n  - 2019: ($17 million)\n  - 2018: ($139 million)\n\n- **Decreases related to lapse of statute of limitations**: \n  - 2020: ($10 million)\n  - 2019: ($7 million)\n  - 2018: ($88 million)\n\n- **Balance at end of period**: \n  - 2020: $755 million\n  - 2019: $755 million\n  - 2018: $1,080 million\n\n- **Net unrecognized tax benefits**: \n  - 2020: $665 million\n  - 2019: $549 million\n  - 2018: $746 million\n\nOverall, the table outlines the adjustments to a company’s tax positions over the specified years, including increases and decreases due to various factors, and their impact on the balances and net unrecognized tax benefits.\nIt is reasonably possible that significant changes in the  balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the  next 12 months. At this time, however, it is not possible to  reasonably estimate the expected change to the total amount  of unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm’s  effective tax rate over the next 12 months. \n\nThe table presents financial data in millions of dollars for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. The data is organized into two rows:\n\n1. **Recognized in income statements:**\n   - 2020: $56 million\n   - 2019: $8 million\n   - 2018: $(40) million\n\n2. **Accrued at end of period:**\n   - 2020: 134 million\n   - 2019: 92 million\n   - 2018: 91 million\n\nThe first row shows the amounts recognized in income statements, and the second row shows the accrued amounts at the end of each period.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are  recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.  Penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years  mentioned above were immaterial. \nThe table contains information about different jurisdictions and their corresponding tax years. It includes the following entries:\n\n- U.S. with a tax year of 2017\n- New York State and New York City with a tax year of 2010\n- Hong Kong with a tax year of 2014\n- U.K. with a tax year of 2011\n- Japan with a tax year of 2015\nThe Firm is under continuous examination by the IRS and  other tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and  the U.K., and in states and localities in which it has significant  business operations, such as New York. \nThe Firm believes that the resolution of these tax  examinations will not have a material effect on the annual  financial statements, although a resolution could have a  material impact in the income statement and on the effective  tax rate for any period in which such resolutions occur. \n23.  Segment,  Geographic  and  Revenue  Information  \nThe Firm structures its segments primarily based upon the  nature of the financial products and services provided to  customers and its management organization. The Firm  provides a wide range of financial products and services to its  customers in each of its business segments: Institutional  Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management.  For a further discussion of the business segments, see Note 1. \nRevenues and expenses directly associated with each  respective business segment are included in determining its  operating results. Other revenues and expenses that are not  directly attributable to a particular business segment are  generally allocated based on each business segment’s  respective net revenues, non-interest expenses or other  relevant measures. \nAs a result of revenues and expenses from transactions with  other operating segments being treated as transactions with  external parties for purposes of segment disclosures, the Firm  includes an Intersegment Eliminations category to reconcile  the business segment results to the consolidated results.

On February 4,  2019, the Firm filed its defense to the matter now styled  Case  number B-803-18. \nThe following matter was terminated during or following  the quarter ended December 31, 2020: \nOn June 22, 2017, the public prosecutor for the Court of  Accounts for the Republic of Italy filed a claim against the  Firm styled  Case No. 2012/00406/MNV , which is pending in  the Regional Prosecutor’s Office at the Judicial Section of the  Court of Auditors for Lazio, Italy. The claim related to certain  derivative transactions between the Republic of Italy and the  Firm. The transactions were originally entered into between  1999 and 2005, and were restructured (and certain of the  transactions were terminated) in December 2011 and January  2012. The claim alleged, inter alia, that the Firm effectively  acted as an agent of the state in connection with these  transactions and asserts claims related to, among other things,  whether the Ministry of Finance was authorized to enter into  these transactions, whether the transactions were appropriate,  and whether the Firm’s conduct related to the termination of  certain transactions was proper. The prosecutor sought  damages through an administrative process against the Firm  for  $\\epsilon2.76$   billion (approximately   $\\S3.4$   billion). On March 30,  2018, the Firm filed its defense to the claim. On June 15,  2018, the Court issued a decision declining jurisdiction and  dismissing the claim against the Firm. A hearing of the public  prosecutor’s appeal was held on January 10, 2019. On March  7, 2019, the Appellate Division of the Court of Accounts for  the Republic of Italy issued a decision affirming the decision  below declining jurisdiction and dismissing the claim against  the Firm. On April 19, 2019, the public prosecutor filed an  appeal with the Italian Supreme Court seeking to overturn this  decision. On June 14, 2019, the Firm filed its response to the  public prosecutor’s appeal. On November 17, 2020, an appeal  hearing took place before the Italian Supreme Court. On  February 1, 2021, the Italian Supreme Court affirmed the  earlier decisions that the Court of Accounts lacked  jurisdiction to hear the claim against the Firm, thereby  dismissing the public prosecutor’s claim against the Firm.

The Firm's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of the Firm's\noutstanding stock under a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase\nProgram”) from time to time as conditions warrant and subject to regulatory non-\nobjection. The Share Repurchase Program is a program for capital management\npurposes that considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as\nwell as equity-based compensation and benefit plan requirements.

As a result, $1.7 billion of\nshare repurchase authorization expired unused on June 30,\n2020. On June 25, 2020, the Federal Reserve published\nsummary results of CCAR and announced that large BHCs,\nincluding the Firm, generally would be restricted in making\nshare repurchases during the third quarter, and on September\n30, 2020, the restrictions were extended through the fourth\nquarter of 2020. On December 18, 2020 the Federal Reserve\npublished summary results of the second round of supervisory\nstress tests for each large BHC, including the Firm, and\npermitted the resumption of share repurchases in the first\nquarter of 2021.
