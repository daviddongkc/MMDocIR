Before the constitutional\nreferendum, the executive branch, including the office of the president of the republic, did not\nhave direct regulatory authority —that is, all regulatory acts of the executive would have to be\nderived from a delegatory act by the legislature, or in the case of regulations, they had to be\nlimited to the implementation of a law.! The constitutional amendments abolished the council\nof ministers and transferred its authority to make delegated legislation to the president, which\nunder the new system constitutes a unitary executive.? By authorizing the president to issue\nCBKs without receiving prior authorization by the legislature, the new system also grants the\npresident direct regulatory authority, albeit with a limited scope.\n\n1 This principle is termed the “legality of administration” in Turkish constitutional law. Before the 2017\nconstitutional amendments, two exceptions to the principle existed: the Council of Ministers could adopt\n“extraordinary decrees with the force of law” (EDWEL) in times of emergency without prior authorization\nfrom the legislature, and the president of the republic (who was the head of the state and not head of the\ngovernment under the prior system) could adopt a presidential decree regulating the organization the\npresident's office and its secretariat without needing any delegation of authority. EDWFLs had to be submitted\nfor the consent of the legislature within a month of adoption.

The establishment of administrative organs and the determination of their powers are  areas that can be exclusively regulated by law under the Constitution,  and the court in  conducting its constitutionality review analyzed whether the designation of the secretary of the  SMC constituted a rule determining the powers of an administrative organ, which would fall  within the exclusive regulatory area of the legislature (which includes the determination of the  cadres and titles of officials according to the precedent of the court 40 ).  The court rejected this  argument, holding that designating an already existing and functioning administrative authority  as the acting secretary (presumably implicitly contrasting this situation to the establishment of a  permanent secretariat 42 ) did not interfere with the area of regulation exclusively granted to the  legislature, and thus did not violate the statute-exclusivity limitation.   \nIn the second decision, the court found that the CBK may authorize the Ministry of Health to  charge a chief physician to act as coordinator between several hospitals.

Nevertheless, it appears that the matter is not yet doctrinally settled, and further  guidance from the Constitutional Court is required.  \nIf it is allowed that CBKs have an exclusive regulatory area, the regulatory landscape with  relation to the existence of direct regulatory authority will consist of (1) an exclusive regulatory  area for law enacted by the legislature, which includes fundamental rights and other subject- matter that is explicitly reserved for enacted statute in the Constitution, (2) the common  regulatory area where both enacted law and GCBKs may govern, in accordance with the  limitations of article 104/17, and (3) a specific regulatory area for SCBKs.   \nIII.  Judicial Review of CBKs   \nWhile the categorization of CBKs as regulatory administrative acts or legislative acts is a matter  of controversy,  the Constitution explicitly designates the Constitutional Court as the forum for  judicial review of CBKs instead of the Council of State (Supreme Administrative Court of Turkey),  which ordinarily reviews regulatory administrative acts as the court of original jurisdiction.

The principle of definiteness is related to [the\nconcept of] legal certainty and necessitates that an individual is able to grasp from the rule which concrete\naction or fact leads to which result, and what kind of an intervention the administration is authorized to make\nas a response. It is only under these circumstances that an individual may foresee the responsibilities he or she\nis charged with and behave accordingly. The principle of legal certainty requires that individuals are able to\ntrust the state in all its actions and transactions, and necessitates that the state avoids procedures that injure\nthis sense of trust.”) (Translation by author).

Recent Controversial Uses of the CBK  \nOn March 20, 2021, President’s Decision No. 3718 was published in the Official Gazette,  withdrawing Turkey from the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating  Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention), which the country had  ratified on February 10, 2012.  The decision met with widespread public criticism from  opposition parties and other groups in the political opposition; however, it also raised questions  among professional organizations and legal scholars on whether the president of the republic had  the authority to withdraw the country from an international treaty.  \nA relevant feature of the President’s Decision was that it cited article 3(1) of CBK No. 9 as its legal  basis.  Article 3(1) of CBK No. 9 essentially copies verbatim and replaces the now repealed  provisions of Law No. 244, which governed the authority of the now defunct Council of Ministers  to ratify, implement, cease implementation, and terminate international treaties, and the  procedures for doing so. The CBK provision substitutes the president of the republic for the now  obsolete Council of Ministers, reflecting the new constitutional system established after the 2017  constitutional amendments.  Like the relevant sections of Law No. 244 before it, article 3(1) of  CBK No. 9 concerning the cessation of implementation and the termination of treaties is silent on  how this authority will be used, particularly in relation to international treaties that  constitutionally require the approval of the legislature before being ratified by the president.   The Constitution foresees three types of international treaties and sets forth three procedural  rules, respectively: the default procedure requires the legislature to enact a preratification law  approving the ratification of the treaty by the president, while two limited categories of  international agreements with certain content may be ratified by the executive without requiring  a preratification law.  The lack of distinction made in article 3(1) of CBK No. 9 (and its  predecessor in Law No. 244) between treaties that require preratification laws and those that do  not has given rise to the question of whether the president has the authority to unilaterally cease  implementation of, or “terminate” an international treaty that required a preratification law  under the Constitution (that is, withdraw Turkey from the perspective of public international law  without obtaining any prior approval or authorization from the legislature).

Treaties that\nwill result in the amendment of Turkish laws are always subject to this procedure. In this default procedure,\nthe passing of a ratification law is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the ratification of the treaty. The\nultimate authority to ratify and promulgate the treaty lies with the president, and the treaty will not become\npart of Turkish law until the ratification decision of the president is promulgated in the Official Gazette.\nProcedure 2: International agreements “regulating economic, commercial or technical relations, and covering a\nperiod of no more than one year” that (1) do not entail any financial commitment by the state, (2) do not\ninterfere with the personal status of individuals or with the property rights of Turkish citizens abroad, and (3)\ndo not result in the amendment of Turkish laws may be ratified and enter into force by promulgation in the\nOfficial Gazette by the decision of the president, without requiring the passage of a ratification law. The\npresident must notify the legislature of the adoption of the agreement ratified through this procedure within\ntwo months of the promulgation of the agreement. Procedure 3: “Implementation agreements based on an\ninternational treaty,” and “economic, commercial, technical, or administrative agreements” concluded on the\nbasis of an authorization provided by law may be ratified by the president without requiring a ratification law.\nSee Kemal Gézler, Uluslarast Andlasmalan.

In its opinion, the majority quoted a preparatory commission report that accompanied the development\nof the bill for Law No. 244 (repealed) that identified the termination of treaties as a “disposition that is within\nthe domain of the executive.” The two judges who did not join the majority opinion wrote dissents in which\nthey argued, inter alia, that since provisions of duly ratified international treaties have the force of law (enacted\nby the legislature) under article 90 of the Constitution, they could not be terminated by a president's decision\non the basis of a presidential decree, and a presidential decree that authorizes the president to issue such a\ndecision would be unconstitutional. The Council of State has jurisdiction to invalidate presidential decisions\nbut not presidential decrees, which can be reviewed only by the Constitutional Court.
