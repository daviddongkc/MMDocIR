We also deployed our new merchant  services capabilities. \nFor our commercial clients, the year was difficult as they had  to absorb massive changes to the business cycle brought by  the health crisis. We were there for them. Early in the year,  we supported their borrowing rush as they sought liquidity in  February, March and April. As conditions stabilized, we helped  with market access for them to raise needed and permanent  capital. We continued to bring digital capabilities to ensure  their businesses could run smoothly, even in a work-from-home  environment. The results for us were a surge in loans to these  businesses. We peaked at   $\\mathsf{S585}$   billion in commercial loans; by  year-end those were down to   $\\mathsf{S499}$   billion.  \nOur investment banking team recorded  $\\mathsf{S7}$   billion in total  investment banking fees and posted three of the strongest  investment banking quarters in our history.

And we offer ongoing training and  development resources to help those teammates grow and  thrive within our organization. We hire with a career mindset.

Since 2012, there  has been no increase in medical premiums for teammates  earning less than  $\\varsigma50{,}000$  . \nTo support our teammates during the health crisis, at work and  at home, we expanded many of our benefits and resources.  This included additional support for mental health, free virtual  consultations and no-cost coronavirus testing.  \nAs the pandemic hit, we knew our teammates were going to  be under pressure at home. For most of them, home was their  workplace. For our 40,000 teammates with children, home was  often a school or daycare. For many teammates with aging  parents, home became an assisted living space. Our teammates  needed help. We offered them   $\\mathsf{S}100$   per day to hire that help.  More than 3 million days of care have been provided. This  helped our teammates immensely  —  they have told us. And it  also allowed them to serve our clients better.  \nIn 2020, we came together to support one another like never  before. It was a great reflection of the commitments, the  compassion and the people that make our company a great  place to work.  \n\\$2B \nWe issued a   $\\mathfrak{s}_{2}$   billion equality  progress sustainability bond   designed to advance racial  equality, economic opportunity and  environmental sustainability. \n\\$1B \nWe launched a  $\\mathfrak{s}1$   billion   corporate social bond , the first  issued by a U.S. commercial   bank to entirely focus on fighting   the pandemic. \nSharing our success with our communities \nOne of the ways we ensure our growth is sustainable is by  sharing our success with the communities in which we work  and live. We invest significant time and money to help address  issues facing our local communities and society at large, and  commit all of our business activities and operations to the task.  \nThis begins with our  $\\mathsf{S}2\\mathsf{50}$   million in annual corporate  philanthropy.

To accelerate our sustainable finance work and help  create a consistent perspective across all of our capabilities  and product offerings, in January 2020, we established the  Sustainable Markets Committee, which I co-chair along with  Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag. To lead this effort, we  named Karen Fang as the Global Head of Sustainable Finance.  Karen and I sat down recently to talk about our progress, the  business, and our goals for 2021. \nAnne:  Karen, we have developed a leadership position in  clean energy finance, and we will discuss that later. This  year, though, we saw particular interest in other aspects of  sustainable finance, against a backdrop of economic and social  challenges during the global health crisis. We mobilized and  deployed approximately  $\\mathsf{S100}$   billion of sustainable finance  capital aligned with the United Nations (U.N.) SDGs in 2020, a  significant increase from 2019 despite the global challenges,  with approximately  $\\mathsf{S55}$   billion allocated to climate finance. In  addition, approximately  $\\mathsf{S}45$   billion was allocated to Inclusive  Development. This includes our significant lending and  investing in affordable housing, healthcare, education and  other social infrastructure as a part of our support for local  communities across the U.S. Also included are the deposits  and equity capital we provided to CDFIs and MDIs, and equity  and fund investments into minority-owned businesses as a  part of our  $\\mathsf{S}1$   billion racial equality and economic opportunity  initiative. And the global health crisis and associated  challenges did offer the opportunity for some unique offerings  by our company. Can you discuss that a little bit? \n\nKaren:  Yes, we are particularly proud of two innovative  transactions we completed in 2020 for Bank of America that  demonstrate the creativity and strength of collaboration  across many of our lines of business in an effort to deliver for   our clients. In May 2020, we issued a  $\\mathsf{S}1$   billion corporate social  bond focused on the coronavirus response, the first such  "}

In 2020, we developed the “4 R’s” approach\nto decarbonization for our corporate clients: Reduce,\nRenew, Retire, and Realign. We financed energy efficiency\nprojects that helped clients reduce their energy usage; we\nhelped shift clients’ electricity footprints from fossil fuels\nto renewable energy by providing debt financing, tax equity\nand leasing capital for wind and solar power generation; we\nmobilized capital for more EV production and leasing; and\nwe financed LEED-certified construction of office facilities\nand manufacturing sites.

Net interest yield, which measures the basis\npoints we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest\nincome on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these\nitems on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from\nboth taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with\nindustry practices.\n\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and\nratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment\n(DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. We believe that the presentation of measures that\nexclude these items is useful because such measures provide\nadditional information to assess the underlying operational\nperformance and trends of our businesses and to allow better\ncomparison of period-to-period operating performance.\n\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that\nutilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible\nequity represents shareholders’ equity or common\nshareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets\n(excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related\ndeferred tax liabilities (\"adjusted\" shareholders' equity or\ncommon shareholders' equity). These measures are used to\nevaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship\nand investment models use both return on average tangible\ncommon shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible\n\n54 Bank of America 2020\n\nshareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall\ngrowth objectives. These ratios are as follows:\n\ne Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity\nmeasures our net income applicable to common\nshareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common\nshareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity\ndivided by total tangible assets.\n\ne Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures\nour net income as a percentage of adjusted average total\nshareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total\ntangible assets.\n\ne Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted\nending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending\ncommon shares outstanding.\n\nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional\nuseful information because they present measures of those\nassets that can generate income. Tangible book value per\ncommon share provides additional useful information about the\nlevel of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of\ncommon stock.\n\nThe aforementioned supplemental data and performance\nmeasures are presented in Tables 6 and 7.\n\nFor more information on the reconciliation of these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial\nmeasures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 111.\n\nKey Performance Indicators\n\nWe present certain key financial and nonfinancial performance\nindicators (key performance indicators) that management uses\nwhen assessing our consolidated and/or segment results. We\nbelieve they are useful to investors because they provide\nadditional information about our underlying operational\nperformance and trends.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items  or otherwise include components that differ from the most  directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with  GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional  useful information to assess our financial condition, results of  operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or  compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These  non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute  for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or  calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used  by other companies.  \nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyses  on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis  are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net  interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an  equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in  income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use  the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent and a representative  state tax rate.

These measures are used to  evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship  and investment models use both return on average tangible  common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible  shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall  growth objectives. These ratios are as follows: \n\n \n\n•   Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity  measures  our  net  income  applicable  to  common  shareholders as a percentage of adjusted average common  shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio  represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity  divided by total tangible assets. \n\n •   Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures  our net income as a percentage of adjusted average total  shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents  adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total  tangible assets. \n\n •   Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted  ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending  common shares outstanding.  \nWe believe ratios utilizing tangible equity provide additional  useful information because they present measures of those  assets that can generate income.

Under the\nrule, applicable subsidiaries of the Corporation would be\npermitted to elect one of two approaches to compute their\nregulatory capital. The first approach is a bank-based capital\napproach, which requires that firms maintain CET1 capital\ngreater than or equal to 6.5 percent of the entity’s RWA as\ncalculated under Basel 3, Total capital greater than or equal to\n8.0 percent of the entity's RWA as calculated under Basel 3 and\nTotal capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the entity's\nuncleared swap margin.

Changes in certain market factors, including, but not\nlimited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact\npotential contractual and contingent outflows and the related\nfinancial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could\nbe material to our financial results.\n\nWe consider all sources of funds that we could access\nduring each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching\navailable sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by\nlegal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage\nour asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines\non certain funding sources and businesses.\n\nNet Stable Funding Ratio Final Rule\n\nOn October 20, 2020, the U.S. Agencies finalized the Net\nStable Funding Ratio (NSFR), a rule requiring large banks to\nmaintain a minimum level of stable funding over a one-year\nperiod.

The final rule is\neffective July 1, 2021. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the\nCorporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. The Corporation expects to be in\ncompliance within the final NSFR rule in the regulatory timeline\nprovided and does not expect any significant impacts to the\nCorporation.\n\nDiversified Funding Sources\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and\nsecured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally\ncoordinated funding approach diversified across products,\nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups.\n\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approach\ninclude greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name\nrecognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the\n\nvariable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where\nregulations, time zone differences or other business\nconsiderations make parent company funding impractical,\n\ncertain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.\n\nWe fund a substantial portion of our lending activities\nthrough our deposits, which were $1.80 trillion and $1.43\ntrillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Risk\nFactors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n84 Bank of America 2020\n\nCredit Risk Management\n\nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure\nof a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk\ncan also arise from operational failures that result in an\nerroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We\ndefine the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the\nloss potential arising from all product classifications including\nloans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-\nfor-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan\ncommitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.\nDerivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-\nfor-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or\nfair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are\naccounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for\ncategories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as\npart of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair\nvalue adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative\npositions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the\nevent the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain\nposition fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We\nuse the current fair value to represent credit exposure without\ngiving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The\ncredit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our\nconsumer and commercial credit extension and review\nprocedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.\nFor more information on derivatives and credit extension\ncommitments, see Note 3 - Derivatives and Note 12 -\nCommitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\n\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the\nborrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of\nunderlying collateral, and other support given current events,\nconditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either\nconsumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as\ndiscussed below.\n\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management\npractices as well as credit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance\ncustomer support in our consumer businesses, we have in\nplace collection programs and loan modification and customer\nassistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to\nmitigate losses in the commercial businesses including\nincreasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,\nhedging activity and our practice of transferring management of\ndeteriorating commercial exposures to independent special\nasset officers as credits enter criticized categories.\n\nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see\nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial\nPortfolio Credit Risk Management on page 91, Non-U.S.\nPortfolio on page 97, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 99,\nand Note 5 - Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for\nCredit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nDuring 2020, the pandemic negatively impacted economic\nactivity in the U.S. and around the world. In particular, beginning\nin the latter portion of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic\nresulted in changes to consumer and business behaviors and\nrestrictions on economic activity. These restrictions gave rise to\nincreased unemployment and underemployment, lower business\nprofits, increased business closures and_ bankruptcies,\nfluctuations and disruptions to commercial and consumer\nspending and markets, and lower global GDP, all of which\nnegatively impacted our consumer and commercial credit\nportfolio.\n", "vlm_text": "Common Stock Dividends  \nFor a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on  common stock during 2020 and through February 24, 2021,  see  Note 13 – Shareholders’ Equity  to the Consolidated  Financial Statements.  \nFinance Subsidiary Issuers and Parent Guarantor  \nBofA Finance LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BofA  Finance), is a consolidated finance subsidiary of the Corporation  that has issued and sold, and is expected to continue to issue  and sell, its senior unsecured debt securities (Guaranteed  Notes), that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the  Corporation.

In addition, the obligations of the  Corporation under the guarantees of the Guaranteed Securities  will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future  liabilities of its subsidiaries, and claimants should look only to  assets of the Corporation for payments. If the Corporation, as  guarantor of the Guaranteed Notes, transfers all or substantially  all of its assets to one or more direct or indirect majority-owned  subsidiaries, under the indenture governing the Guaranteed  Notes, the subsidiary or subsidiaries will not be required to  assume the Corporation’s obligations under its guarantee of the  Guaranteed Notes.  \nFor more information on factors that may affect payments to  holders of the Guaranteed Securities, see Liquidity Risk – NB  Holdings Corporation in this section, see Item 1. Business of  our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk  Factors of our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nCredit Risk Management  \nCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure  of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk  can also arise from operational failures that result in an  erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We  define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the  loss potential arising from all product classifications including  loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held- for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan  commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees.  Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held- for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or  fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are  accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for  categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as  part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair  value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative  positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the  event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain  position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We  use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without  giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The  credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally  enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our  consumer and commercial credit extension and review  procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures.  For more information on derivatives and credit extension  commitments, see  Note 3 – Derivatives  and  Note 12 –  Commitments and Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial  Statements.  \nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the  borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of  underlying collateral, and other support given current events,  conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either  consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as  discussed below.  \nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk management  practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing  economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance  customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in  place collection programs and loan modification and customer  assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to  mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including  increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring,  hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of  deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special  asset officers as credits enter criticized categories .   \nFor information on our credit risk management activities, see  Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial  Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 91, Non-U.S.  Portfolio on page 97, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 99,  and  Note 5 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Allowance for  Credit Losses  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  \nDuring 2020, the pandemic negatively impacted economic  activity in the U.S. and around the world. In particular, beginning  in the latter portion of the first quarter of 2020, the pandemic  resulted in changes to consumer and business behaviors and  restrictions on economic activity. These restrictions gave rise to  increased unemployment and underemployment, lower business  profits,  increased  business  closures  and  bankruptcies,  fluctuations and disruptions to commercial and consumer  spending and markets, and lower global GDP, all of which  negatively impacted our consumer and commercial credit  portfolio.

As  a result, in the following tables and discussions of the  residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude  loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide  information that excludes the impact of the fully-insured loan  portfolio in certain credit quality statistics.  \nResidential Mortgage  \nThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest  percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 52 percent of  consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2020.  Approximately 52 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio  was in  Consumer Banking  and 40 percent was in  GWIM.  The  remaining portion was in  All Other  and was comprised of loans  used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans  repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with the  Government National Mortgage Association as well as loans  repurchased related to our representations and warranties.  \n\nOutstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio  decreased   $\\S12.6$   billion in 2020 as both loan sales and  paydowns were partially offset by originations.  \nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the residential mortgage  portfolio included   $\\S1\\beth.8$   billion and   $\\S18.7$   billion of outstanding  fully-insured loans, of which   $\\S2.8$   billion and   $\\S1\\1.2$   billion had  FHA insurance, with the remainder protected by Fannie Mae  long-term standby agreements. The decline was primarily driven  by sales of loans with FHA insurance during 2020.  \nTable 22 presents certain residential mortgage key credit  statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the fully- insured loan portfolio.

During 2020, nine  percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not  pay any principal on their HELOCs.  \nTable 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and  net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home  equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern  New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the  outstanding home equity portfolio at both December 31, 2020  and 2019. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within  California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity  portfolio at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.  \nThe table presents data related to a home equity loan portfolio across different states, including:\n\n1. **Outstandings:**\n   - For December 31, comparing 2020 and 2019\n   - Values for California, Florida, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and Other regions are listed.\n   - The total outstanding amount decreases from $40,208 million in 2019 to $34,311 million in 2020.\n\n2. **Nonperforming Loans:**\n   - For December 31, comparing 2020 and 2019\n   - Nonperforming amounts for each state, with a total of $649 million in 2020 and $536 million in 2019.\n\n3. **Net Charge-offs:**\n   - Comparing the years 2020 and 2019\n   - Charge-off amounts are listed, showing a total of ($73) million in 2020 and ($358) million in 2019.\n\nThe table breaks down financial data for various states, showing trends in outstandings, nonperforming loans, and net charge-offs over the two years."}

To  lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels,  we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or  counterparty group by selling protection.  \nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, net notional credit default  protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge  our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the  fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was   $\\S4.2$   billion and   $\\S3.3$   billion. We recorded net losses of   $\\S_{ Ḋ }240 Ḍ$  million in 2020 compared to net losses of  $\\S145$   million in 2019  for these same positions. The gains and losses on these  instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related  exposures.

Hedging\ninstruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and\nother credit fixed-income instruments.\n\nMarket Liquidity Risk\n\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of\nexpected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain\ncases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will\nnot be able to transact business and execute trades in an\norderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could\nbe further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing\ncorrelations are compromised by disproportionate demand or\nlack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk\nmitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading\nRisk Management.\n\nTrading Risk Management\n\nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual\nand potential volatility of revenues generated by individual\npositions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques\nand procedures are utilized to enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market\nrisk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the\nportfolio of the Corporation. These measures include\nsensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as\nthe potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change\nin interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual\nand hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and _ stress\ntesting. Periods of extreme market stress influence the\nreliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative\nevaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk\nmeasures while understanding each of their respective\nlimitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate\nthe risk of the portfolios under the current market environment\nand potential future environments.\n\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it\nallows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the\neffects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the\nvalue of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to\ngenerate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR\nrepresents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more\nthan a certain number of times per period, based on a specified\nholding period, confidence level and window of historical data.\nWe use one VaR model consistently across the trading\nportfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on\na three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic\nis equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means\nthat for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be\nlosses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading\ndays.\n\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous\nassumptions that will differ from company to company. The\naccuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A\nVaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for\nnew products that do not have the necessary historical market\ndata or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices\n\n102 Bank of America 2020\n\nare not consistently available. For positions with insufficient\nhistorical data for the VaR calculation, the process for\nestablishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and\nstatistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position.\nThis analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate\nboth the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk\nfactors that the missing data would be expected to experience.\n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as\nchanges in market conditions or in the composition of the\nportfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular,\nthe historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate\nhigher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be\nexperienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market\nconditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR\nmodel on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of\nmarket stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying\nthe model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading\npositions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as\npart of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see\nCapital Management on page 73.\n\nGlobal Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and\nenhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in\nour trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed\nand approved prior to implementation and any material changes\nare reported to management through the appropriate\nmanagement committees.\n\nTrading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR,\nare independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and\nreviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain\nrelevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks.\nTrading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity,\nvolatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set\nat both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks\nas well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations\namong risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least\nannually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a\ncentralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses\nare communicated to management for review. Certain\nquantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits\nhave been identified as critical in the Corporation’s Risk\nAppetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a\ndaily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and\nthe Board.\n\nIn periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership\ncommunicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and\nany limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses\nmay selectively reduce risk.\n\nTable 44 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which\nis the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid\ntrading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio.\nCovered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading\nassets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet\na defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the\nmost liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a\nshort-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material\nrisk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid\nmarkets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade\nthe positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions.\nForeign exchange and commodity positions are always\nconsidered covered positions, except for structural foreign\ncurrency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory\napproval.

Our  portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an  asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of  credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging  instruments used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and  other credit fixed-income instruments.  \nMarket Liquidity Risk  \nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of  expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain  cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will  not be able to transact business and execute trades in an  orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could  be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing  correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or  lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk  mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading  Risk Management.  \nTrading Risk Management  \nTo evaluate risks in our trading activities, we focus on the actual  and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual  positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques  and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete  understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market  risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the  portfolio  of  the  Corporation.  These  measures  include  sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as  the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change  in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual  and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress  testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the  reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative  evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk  measures while understanding each of their respective  limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate  the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment  and potential future environments.  \nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it  allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the  effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the  value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to  generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR  represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more  than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified  holding period, confidence level and window of historical data.  We use one VaR model consistently across the trading  portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on  a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic  is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level, which means  that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be  losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading  days.  \nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerous  assumptions that will differ from company to company. The  accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality  of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A  VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for  new products that do not have the necessary historical market  data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices  are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient  historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for  establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and  statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position.  This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate  both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk  factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.  \n\nVaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as  changes in market conditions or in the composition of the  portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular,  the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate  higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be  experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market  conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR  model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of  market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying  the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading  positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as  part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see  Capital Management on page 73.  \nGlobal Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and  enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in  our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed  and approved prior to implementation and any material changes  are  reported  to  management  through  the  appropriate  management committees.  \nTrading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR,  are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and  reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain  relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks.  Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity,  volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set  at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks  as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations  among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least  annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a  centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses  are communicated to management for review. Certain  quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits  have been identified as critical in the Corporation’s Risk  Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a  daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and  the Board.  \nIn periods of market stress,  Global Markets  senior leadership  communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and  any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses  may selectively reduce risk.  \nTable 44 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which  is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid  trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio.  Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading  assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet  a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the  most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a  short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material  risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid  markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade  the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions.  Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always  considered covered positions, except for structural foreign  currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory  approval. In addition, Table 44 presents our fair value option  portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and  unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and  their corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 44 differs from VaR  used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period  being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory  capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR  presented below, it is one day.

Interest rate risk\nis measured as the potential change in net interest income\ncaused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing\nactivities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest\nrate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.\n\nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.\nThe baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future\nbusiness growth, ALM positioning -and the direction of interest\nrate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.\n\nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative\ninterest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to\nassess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net\ninterest income forecast is frequently updated for changing\nassumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends,\nmarket conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually\nmonitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an\nacceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.\n\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate\nbalance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth\nand pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity\ncharacteristics and investment securities premium amortization.\nOur overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that\nmovements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect\nearnings and capital.\n\nTable 46 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used\nin our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n\nTable 46 Forward Rates\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\nFederal Three-month 10-Year\nFunds LIBOR Swap\nSpot rates 0.25 % 0.24 % 0.93 %\n12-month forward rates 0.25 0.19 1.06\nDecember 31, 2019\nSpot rates 1.75 % 1.91 % 1.90 %\n12-month forward rates 1.50 1.62 1.92\n\nTable 47 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest\nincome over the next 12 months from December 31, 2020 and\n2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel\n\nshocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we\nevaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in\nthe context of the current rate environment. The interest rate\nscenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.\n\nDuring 2020, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet\nincreased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios primarily due\nto continued deposit growth invested in long-term securities. We\ncontinue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in\ninterest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the\nshort end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates\nimpact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for\ndebt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect\naccumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3\ncapital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the\nnear-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over\ntime by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income.

As part of our ALM\nactivities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and\ninterest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing\ninterest rate sensitivity.\n\nThe behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline\nforecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key\nassumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes no change in\ndeposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in\nalternate rate environments.

For  more  information, see Managing Risk on page 70.  \nInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking  Book  \nThe following discussion presents net interest income for  banking book activities.  \nInterest rate risk represents the most significant market risk  exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk  is measured as the potential change in net interest income  caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing  activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest  rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.  \nWe prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.  The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future  business growth, ALM positioning -and the direction of interest  rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve.  \nWe then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative  interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to  assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net  interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing  assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends,  market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually  monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an  acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.  \nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate  balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth  and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity  characteristics and investment securities premium amortization.  Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that  movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect  earnings and capital.  \nTable 46 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used  in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2020 and 2019.  \nThe table presents spot rates and 12-month forward rates for three financial indicators: Federal Funds, Three-month LIBOR, and 10-Year Swap, on two different dates—December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2019.\n\nFor December 31, 2020:\n- Spot rates are:\n  - Federal Funds: 0.25%\n  - Three-month LIBOR: 0.24%\n  - 10-Year Swap: 0.93%\n- 12-month forward rates are:\n  - Federal Funds: 0.25%\n  - Three-month LIBOR: 0.19%\n  - 10-Year Swap: 1.06%\n\nFor December 31, 2019:\n- Spot rates are:\n  - Federal Funds: 1.75%\n  - Three-month LIBOR: 1.91%\n  - 10-Year Swap: 1.90%\n- 12-month forward rates are:\n  - Federal Funds: 1.50%\n  - Three-month LIBOR: 1.62%\n  - 10-Year Swap: 1.92%\nTable 47 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest  income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2020 and  2019 resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel  shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we  evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in  the context of the current rate environment. The interest rate  scenarios also assume U.S. dollar rates are floored at zero.  \n\nDuring 2020, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet  increased in both up-rate and down-rate scenarios primarily due  to continued deposit growth invested in long-term securities. We  continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in  interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the  short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates  impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for  debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect  accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3  capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the  near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over  time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For  more information on Basel  3,  see Capital Management –  Regulatory Capital on page 74.  \nThe table outlines the impact of changes in interest rates, measured in basis points (bps), on financial metrics for two years, 2020 and 2019, expressed in millions of dollars. The table is divided into three scenarios: Parallel Shifts, Flatteners, and Steepeners, with each scenario exploring different changes in short-term and long-term interest rates.\n\n1. **Parallel Shifts**:\n   - **+100 bps instantaneous shift**: Both short and long rates increase by 100 basis points. The impact for 2020 is $10,468 million, while in 2019 it was $4,190 million.\n   - **-25 bps instantaneous shift**: Both short and long rates decrease by 25 basis points. The impact for 2020 is a loss of $(2,766) million, compared to a loss of $(1,500) million in 2019.\n\n2. **Flatteners**:\n   - **Short-end instantaneous change**: The short-term rate increases by 100 bps. The impact for 2020 is $6,321 million, whereas in 2019 it was $2,641 million.\n   - **Long-end instantaneous change**: The long-term rate decreases by 25 bps. The impact for 2020 is a loss of $(1,686) million, compared to a loss of $(653) million in 2019.\n\n3. **Steepeners**:\n   - **Short-end instantaneous change**: The short-term rate decreases by 25 bps. The impact for 2020 is a loss of $(1,084) million, while in 2019 it was a loss of $(844) million.\n   - **Long-end instantaneous change**: The long-term rate increases by 100 bps. The impact for 2020 is $4,333 million, compared to $1,561 million in 2019.\n\nThe table illustrates how the financial metrics evolve with different interest rate scenarios across two years.\nThe sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes that we take no  action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume  any change in other macroeconomic variables normally  correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM  activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and  interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing  interest rate sensitivity.  \nThe behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline  forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key  assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income.  The sensitivity analysis in Table 47 assumes no change in  deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in  alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any  customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or non- interest-bearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or market- based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.  \nInterest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative  Contracts  \nInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are  utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to  manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use  derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in  fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign  exchange components.

These fluctuations would not be indicative of\ndeficiencies in our models or inputs.\n\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that requires the measurement of the\nallowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments, to be based on management's best estimate of\nlifetime ECL inherent in the Corporation's relevant financial\nassets.\n\nThe Corporation's estimate of lifetime ECL includes the use\nof quantitative models that incorporate forward-looking\nmacroeconomic scenarios that are applied over the contractual\nlife of the loan portfolios, adjusted for expected prepayments\nand borrower-controlled extension options. These\nmacroeconomic scenarios include variables that have\nhistorically been key drivers of increases and decreases in\ncredit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,\nunemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product\nand corporate bond spreads. As any one economic outlook is\ninherently uncertain, the Corporation leverages multiple\nscenarios. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the\namount of weighting given to each scenario depend on a variety\nof factors including recent economic events, leading economic\nindicators, views of internal and third-party economists and\nindustry trends.\n\nThe Corporation also includes qualitative reserves to cover\nlosses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,\nmay not be adequately reflected in the economic assumptions\ndescribed above. For example, factors the Corporation\nconsiders include changes in lending policies and procedures,\nbusiness conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,\nportfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due\nloans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such\nas competition and legal and regulatory requirements, among\nothers. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent\nuncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical\ndata.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses can also be impacted by\nunanticipated changes in asset quality of the portfolio, such as\nincreases in risk rating downgrades in our commercial portfolio,\ndeterioration in borrower delinquencies or credit scores in our\ncredit card portfolio or increases in LTVs in our consumer real\nestate portfolio. In addition, while we have incorporated our\nestimated impact of COVID-19 into our allowance for credit\nlosses, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown,\nincluding how long economic activities will be impacted and\nwhat effect the unprecedented levels of government fiscal and\nmonetary actions will have on the economy and our credit\nlosses.\n\nAs described above, the process to determine the allowance\nfor credit losses requires numerous’ estimates and\nassumptions, some of which require a high degree of judgment\nand are often interrelated. Changes in the estimates and\nassumptions can result in significant changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses. Our process for determining the allowance for\ncredit losses is further discussed in Note 1 - Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles and Note 5 - Outstanding Loans\n\nand Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\n\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair\nvalue measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based\non the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting\nstandards.\n\nThe fair values of assets and liabilities may include\nadjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where\nappropriate. Valuations of products using models or other\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant\ninputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for\nvaluation reflect that information as of our valuation date.\nInputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they\nare supported by little or no market activity. In periods of\nextreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there\nmay be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market\ndata to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the\nprudent application of estimates and management judgment in\ndetermining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in\nplace various processes and controls that include: a model\nvalidation policy that requires review and approval of\nquantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement\nfair value determination and risk quantification; a trading\nproduct valuation policy that requires verification of all traded\nproduct valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of\ndaily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily\nthrough validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing\nservice inputs which can and do include both market-observable\nand internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our\nreliance on this information is affected by our understanding of\nhow the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a\nhigher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly\nobservable and lesser reliance applied to those developed\nthrough their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes\nin less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less\nreliable. These processes and controls are performed\nindependently of the business. For more information, see Note\n20 - Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 - Fair Value Option\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nLevel 3 Assets and Liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are\nbased on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both\nunobservable and are significant to the overall fair value\nmeasurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value\nhierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The\nfair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and\nMSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow\nmethodologies or similar techniques for which the determination\nof fair value requires significant management judgment or\nestimation.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives\nclassified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated\nwith Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or\nlosses associated with financial instruments classified in other\nlevels of the fair value hierarchy.

Our estimated cash flows\nconsidered the current challenging global industry and market\nconditions related to the pandemic, including the low interest\nrate environment.

The fair values of the reporting units as a  percentage of their carrying values ranged from 109 percent to  213 percent. It currently remains difficult to estimate the future  economic impacts related to the pandemic. If economic and  market conditions (both in the U.S. and internationally)  deteriorate, our reporting units could be negatively impacted,  which could change our key assumptions and related estimates  and may result in a future impairment charge.  \nCertain Contingent Liabilities  \nFor more information on the complex judgments associated with  certain contingent liabilities, see  Note 12 – Commitments and  Contingencies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  are discussed in  Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting  Principles , and  Note 7 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets  to the  Consolidated Financial Statements.

For commercial and consumer card loans, the  expected credit loss is estimated using quantitative methods  that consider a variety of factors such as historical loss  experience, the current credit quality of the portfolio as well as  an economic outlook over the life of the loan. In its loss  forecasting framework, the Corporation incorporates forward  looking information through the use of macroeconomic  scenarios applied over the forecasted life of the assets. These  macroeconomic  scenarios  include  variables  that  have  historically been key drivers of increases and decreases in  credit losses. These variables include, but are not limited to,  unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product  levels and corporate bond spreads. The scenarios that are  chosen and the amount of weighting given to each scenario  depend on a variety of factors including recent economic events,  leading economic indicators, views of internal as well as third- party economists and industry trends. Also included in the  allowance for loan losses are qualitative reserves to cover  losses that are expected but, in the Corporation's assessment,  may not be adequately reflected in the quantitative methods or  the economic assumptions. Factors that the Corporation  considers include changes in lending policies and procedures,  business conditions, the nature and size of the portfolio,  portfolio concentrations, the volume and severity of past due  loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such  as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements, among  others. Further, the Corporation considers the inherent  uncertainty in quantitative models that are built on historical  data.  "}

The term “the Corporation” as used\nherein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually,\nBank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of\nBank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of\nthe Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those\nvariable interest entities (VIES) where the Corporation is the\nprimary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions\nhave been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired\ncompanies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for\nVIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary\nbeneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are\nnot included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The\nCorporation accounts for investments in companies for which it\nowns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence over operating and financing decisions\nusing the equity method of accounting. These investments are\nincluded in other assets. Equity method investments are subject\nto impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate\nshare of income or loss is included in other income.\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the\nUnited States of America requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and\ndisclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those\nestimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have\nbeen reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\nNew Accounting Standards\n\nAccounting for Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\n\nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new\naccounting standard that requires the measurement of the\nallowance for credit losses to be based on management's best\nestimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in the\nCorporation’s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the\nstandard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation recorded a $3.3\nbillion, or 32 percent, increase to the allowance for credit\nlosses. After adjusting for deferred taxes and other adoption\n\neffects, a $2.4 billion decrease was recorded in retained\nearnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Prior to\nJanuary 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was\n\ndetermined based on management's estimate of probable\nincurred losses.\n\nReference Rate Reform\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new\naccounting standard in March 2020, which was subsequently\namended in January 2021, related to contracts or hedging\nrelationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate\n(LIBOR) or other reference rates that are expected to be\ndiscontinued due to reference rate reform.

The term “the Corporation” as used  herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually,  Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of  Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates.  \nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation  \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of  the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those  variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the  primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions  have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired  companies are included from the dates of acquisition, and for  VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary  beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are  not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The  Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it  owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise  significant influence over operating and financing decisions  using the equity method of accounting. These investments are  included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject  to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate  share of income or loss is included in other income.  \nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in  conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the  United States of America requires management to make  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and  disclosures. Actual results could materially differ from those  estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have  been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.  \nNew Accounting Standards  \nAccounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit Losses  \nOn January 1, 2020, the Corporation adopted the new  accounting standard that requires the measurement of the  allowance for credit losses to be based on management’s best  estimate of lifetime expected credit losses (ECL) inherent in the  Corporation’s relevant financial assets. Upon adoption of the  standard on January 1, 2020, the Corporation recorded a   $\\S3.3$  billion, or 32 percent, increase to the allowance for credit  losses. After adjusting for deferred taxes and other adoption  effects, a   $\\S2.4$   billion decrease was recorded in retained  earnings through a cumulative-effect adjustment. Prior to  January 1, 2020, the allowance for credit losses was  determined based on management’s estimate of probable  incurred losses.  \nReference Rate Reform  \nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new  accounting standard in March 2020, which was subsequently  amended in January 2021, related to contracts or hedging  relationships that reference London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR) or other reference rates that are expected to be  discontinued due to reference rate reform. The new standard  provides for optional expedients and other guidance regarding  the accounting related to modifications of contracts, hedging  relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate  reform. The Corporation has elected to retrospectively adopt the  new standard as of January 1, 2020. The adoption did not have  a material accounting impact on the Corporation’s consolidated  financial position or results of operations; however, it did ease  the administrative burden in accounting for certain effects of  reference rate reform.  \n\nSignificant Accounting Principles  \nCash and Cash Equivalents   \nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in  the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and  other  brokerage  regulations,  and  amounts  due  from  correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain  non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as  to withdrawal or usage by legally binding contractual agreements  or regulatory requirements.  \nSecurities Financing Agreements  \nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell  and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase  (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized  financing transactions except in instances where the transaction  is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase  transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at  acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest, except for  securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts  for under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of  securities financing agreements that are accounted for under  the fair value option are recorded in market making and similar  activities in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  \nThe Corporation’s policy is to monitor the market value of  the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and  obtain  collateral  from  or  return  collateral  pledged  to  counterparties  when  appropriate.  Securities  financing  agreements do not create material credit risk due to these  collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is  not necessary.  \nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a  securities lending agreement and receives securities that can  be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the  Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the  securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to  return those securities.  \nCollateral  \nThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that  it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At  December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of this collateral  was   $\\S812.4$   billion and   $\\S693.0$   billion, of which   $\\Updownarrow758.5$   billion  and   $\\S593.8$   billion were sold or repledged. The primary source  of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under  agreements to resell.  \nThe Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and  loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase  agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S.  Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This  collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the  counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed  on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \nIn certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to  consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as  collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are  included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of  Consolidated VIEs. "}

The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment  are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real  estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business  commercial.  \n\nThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers  through a variety of lessor arrangements. Direct financing  leases and sales-type leases are carried at the aggregate of  lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of  the leased property less unearned income, which is accreted to  interest income over the lease terms using methods that  approximate the interest method. Operating lease income is  recognized on a straight-line basis. The Corporation's lease  arrangements generally do not contain non-lease components.  \nAllowance for Credit Losses  \nThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for  loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending  commitments and represents management’s estimate of the  ECL in the Corporation’s loan and lease portfolio, excluding  loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under  the fair value option. The ECL on funded consumer and  commercial loans and leases is referred to as the allowance for  loan and lease losses and is reported separately as a contra- asset to loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The ECL for unfunded lending commitments, including home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), standby letters of credit (SBLCs)  and binding unfunded loan commitments is reported on the  Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other  liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and  lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported  in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  "}

The Corporation does not reserve for credit losses on the  unpaid principal balance of loans insured by the Federal  Housing Administration (FHA) and long-term standby loans, as  these loans are fully insured. The Corporation records a reserve  for unfunded lending commitments for the ECL associated with  the undrawn portion of the Corporation’s HELOCs, which can  only be canceled by the Corporation if certain criteria are met.  The ECL associated with these unfunded lending commitments  is calculated using the same models and methodologies noted  above and incorporate utilization assumptions at time of  default.  \nFor loans that are more than 180 days past due and  collateral-dependent TDRs, the Corporation bases the allowance  on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral as of the  reporting date less costs to sell. The fair value of the collateral  securing these loans is generally determined using an  automated valuation model (AVM) that estimates the value of a  property by reference to market data including sales of  comparable properties and price trends specific to the  Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued  is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the  Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods  provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals  or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the  collateral.

If the estimated  property value decreases in periods subsequent to the initial  charge-off, the Corporation will record an additional charge-off;  however, if the value increases in periods subsequent to the  charge-off, the Corporation will adjust the allowance to account  for the increase but not to a level above the cumulative charge- off amount.

In\n\naddition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do\nnot meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at\nDecember 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the guidance\nincluded in an interagency statement issued by the bank\nregulatory agencies. This guidance states that loan\nmodifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan\npayment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that\nwere granted to borrowers who were current as of the\nimplementation date of a loan modification program or\nmodifications granted under government mandated modification\nprograms, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a\npayment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and\nnonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral\nperiod. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during\nthe deferral period using a constant effective yield method.

Concessions could include a reduction in  the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan,  payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or  other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are  carried at fair value and LHFS are not classified as TDRs.  \nLoans and leases whose contractual terms have been  modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring  may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated  performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under  the restructured terms is expected. Otherwise, the loans are  placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming,  except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is  sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period,  generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in  accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are  placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming  TDRs.  \nSecured consumer loans that have been discharged in  Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the  borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such  loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the  estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the  time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current,  interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on  a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a  binding offer to restructure has been extended are also  classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer  loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on  accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off,  which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the   loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been  placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.  \nA loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is  subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at  a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a  new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.  \nCOVID-19 Programs  \nThe Corporation has implemented various consumer and  commercial loan modification programs to provide its borrowers  relief from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (the  pandemic). In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and  Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the Corporation has elected  to not apply TDR classification to eligible COVID-19 related loan  modifications that were performed after March 1, 2020 to loans  that were current as of December 31, 2019. Accordingly, these  restructurings are not classified as TDRs. The availability of this  election expires upon the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days  after the national emergency related to COVID-19 terminates. In  addition, for loans modified in response to the pandemic that do  not meet the above criteria (e.g., current payment status at  December 31, 2019), the Corporation is applying the guidance  included in an interagency statement issued by the bank  regulatory  agencies.  This  guidance  states  that  loan  modifications performed in light of the pandemic, including loan  payment deferrals that are up to six months in duration, that  were granted to borrowers who were current as of the  implementation date of a loan modification program or  modifications granted under government mandated modification  programs, are not TDRs. For loan modifications that include a  payment deferral and are not TDRs, the borrowers' past due and  nonaccrual status have not been impacted during the deferral  period. The Corporation has continued to accrue interest during  the deferral period using a constant effective yield method. For  most mortgage, HELOC and commercial loan modifications, the  contractual interest that accrued during the deferral period is  payable at the maturity of the loan. The Corporation includes  these amounts with the unpaid principal balance when  computing its allowance for credit losses. Amounts that are  subsequently deemed uncollectible are written off against the  allowance for credit losses.  \n\nLoans Held-for-sale  \nLoans that the Corporation intends to sell in the foreseeable  future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and  to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance  and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the  lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts  for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the  fair value option. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the  lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying  value of the loans and, upon the sale of a loan, are recognized  as part of the gain or loss in noninterest income. LHFS that are  on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as  defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from  nonperforming loans and leases.  \nPremises and Equipment  \nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated  depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization  are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated  useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years  for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and  the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold  improvements.  \nOther Assets  \nFor the Corporation’s financial assets that are measured at  amortized cost and are not included in debt securities or loans  and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation  evaluates these assets for ECL using various techniques. For  assets that are subject to collateral maintenance provisions,  including federal funds sold and securities borrowed or  purchased under agreements to resell, where the collateral  consists of daily margining of liquid and marketable assets  where the margining is expected to be maintained into the  foreseeable future, the expected losses are assumed to be  zero. For all other assets, the Corporation performs qualitative  analyses, including consideration of historical losses and  current economic conditions, to estimate any ECL which are  then included in a valuation account that is recorded as a  contra-asset against the amortized cost basis of the financial  asset.

The\nconsolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is\ninvolved may change as a result of such reassessments.\n\nThe Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization\nactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt\nsecurities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is\nthe servicer of whole loans held in a_ securitization trust,\nincluding non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans,\ncredit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to\ndirect the most significant activities of the trust.

All leases are recorded on the Consolidated Balance  Sheet except leases with an initial term less than 12 months for  which the Corporation made the short-term lease election.  Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the  lease term and is recorded in occupancy and equipment  expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.  \nThe Corporation made an accounting policy election not to  separate lease and non-lease components of a contract that is  or contains a lease for its real estate and equipment leases.

The Corporation has an  unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for  any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to  performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The  Corporation may resume performing the qualitative assessment  in any subsequent period.  \nWhen performing the quantitative assessment, if the fair  value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of  the reporting unit would not be considered impaired. If the  carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a  goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by  which the reporting unit’s allocated equity exceeds its fair value.  An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of  goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss  establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent  reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under  applicable accounting guidance.  \n\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment  loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is  not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the  intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the  sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the  use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite  useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss  is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an  indefinite life exceeds its fair value.  \nVariable Interest Entities  \nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity  investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity  through their equity investments.

The power to direct the most significant activities of a  commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the  special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate  securities which embody certain controlling rights. The  Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it  has the power to direct the most significant activities and also  holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual  arrangements, other than standard representations and  warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.  \nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securities  and AFS securities into municipal bond or res e curit iz ation  trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or  res e curit iz ation trust if it has control over the ongoing activities  of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust’s liabilities or, if  there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design  of the trust, including the identification of securities to be  transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and  also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments  that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation  does not consolidate a municipal bond or res e curit iz ation trust if  one or a limited number of third-party investors share  responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the  significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other  substantive rights.  \nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized  debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf  of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation  does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and,  therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities  that  most  significantly  impact  the  economic  performance of a CDO.

In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt  securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these  debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets,  debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based  primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.  Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests  are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair  values based on the present value of the associated expected  future cash flows.  \nFair Value  \nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and  liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting  guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.  Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use  of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable  inputs in measuring fair value. Under applicable accounting  standards, fair value measurements are categorized into one of  three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with  the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active  markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs.

This category generally  includes retained residual interests in securitizations,  consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured,  complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain  loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where  independent pricing information cannot be obtained for  a significant portion of the underlying assets.  \nIncome Taxes  \nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and  deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid  or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense  results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities  between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities  represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid  in the future because of future reversals of temporary  differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured  by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial  statements.

Interchange fees are recognized upon  settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions  and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit  cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the  corresponding payment network’s rates. Substantially all card  fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain  time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over  12 months. Fees charged to cardholders and merchants that  are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance  for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards  and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders  are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be  redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel  and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based  on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The  liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation  also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are  based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven  by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part  of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner  provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit  card partner’s members or customers on behalf of the  Corporation.

As part\nof the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner\nprovides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit\ncard partner's members or customers on behalf of the\nCorporation.\n\nService Charges\n\nService charges include deposit and lending-related fees.\nDeposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and\ncommercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when\nthe transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer\nfees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account\nmaintenance and various transaction-based services, such as\nATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money\norder processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions.\nCommercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation’s\nGlobal Transaction Services business and consist of commercial\ndeposit and treasury management services, including account\nmaintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep\naccount and other cash management services. Lending-related\nfees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain\nloan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.\n\nInvestment and Brokerage Services\nInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset\nmanagement and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are\nearned from the management of client assets under advisory\nagreements or the full discretion of the Corporation’s financial\nadvisors (collectively referred to as assets under management\n(AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of\nthe client’s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps)\nto 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to\nobtain a client’s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the\nthird party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\nBrokerage fees include income earned from transaction-\nbased services that are performed as part of investment\nmanagement services and are based on a fixed price per unit or\nas a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees\nalso include distribution fees and sales commissions that are\nprimarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM)\nsegment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the\nGlobal Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the\nCorporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial\nproducts or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears\ntransactions and/or submits trade information to the\nappropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage,\nclearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory\nbodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These\nfees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction\nprice, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.\n\nInvestment Banking Income\n\nInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and\nfinancial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees\nearned for the placement of a customer’s debt or equity\nsecurities. The revenue is generally earned based on a\npercentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed.\nOnce the number of shares or notes is determined and the\nservice is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The\nCorporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal\ncosts, in performing these services. These expenses are\n\n132 Bank of America 2020\n\nrecovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the\ncustomer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication\nfees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender\nresponsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan\nsyndication.\n\nFinancial advisory services consist of fees earned for\nassisting clients with transactions related to mergers and\nacquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies\ndepending on the size of the transaction and scope of services\nperformed and is generally contingent on successful completion\nof the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the\ntransaction is completed and all services have been rendered.\nAdditionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and\nacquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the\nfees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the client.\n\nOther Revenue Measurement and Recognition Policies\n\nThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open\nperformance obligations at December 31, 2020, as _ its\ncontracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less\nthan one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is\nless than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to\nrecognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.\n\nEarnings Per Common Share\n\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net\nincome allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-\naverage common shares outstanding, excluding unvested\ncommon shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net\nincome allocated to common shareholders is net income\nadjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends\ndeclared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including\naccelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and\ncumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that\nhave not been declared as of period end, less income allocated\nto participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing\nincome allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on\ndilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can\nbe tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average\ncommon shares outstanding plus amounts representing the\ndilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock,\nrestricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the\ndilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred\nstock, if applicable.\n\nForeign Currency Translation\n\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and\nsubsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of\neach entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation\nis the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are\ntranslated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency\nto the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for\nassets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results\nof operations.

When\nthe foreign entity’s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the\nresulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency-\ndenominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.\n\nPaycheck Protection Program\n\nThe Corporation is participating in the Paycheck Protection\nProgram (PPP), which is a loan program that originated from the\nCARES Act and was subsequently expanded by the Paycheck\nProtection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.

The PPP  is designed to provide U.S. small businesses with cash-flow  assistance through loans fully guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA). If the borrower meets certain  criteria and uses the proceeds towards certain eligible  expenses, the borrower’s obligation to repay the loan can be  forgiven up to the full principal amount of the loan and any  accrued interest. Upon borrower forgiveness, the SBA pays the  Corporation for the principal and accrued interest owed on the  loan. If the full principal of the loan is not forgiven, the loan will  operate according to the original loan terms with the 100  percent SBA guaranty remaining. As of December 31, 2020, the  Corporation had approximately 332,000 PPP loans with a  carrying value of   $\\S22.7$   billion. As compensation for originating  the loans, the Corporation received lender processing fees from  the SBA, which are capitalized, along with the loan origination  costs, and will be amortized over the loans’ contractual lives  and recognized as interest income. Upon forgiveness of a loan  and repayment by the SBA, any unrecognized net capitalized  fees and costs related to the loan will be recognized as interest  income in that period.  "}

At both December 31, 2020\nand 2019, the Corporation had transferred $5.2 billion of non-\nU.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a\nthird-party trust and retained economic exposure to the\ntransferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection\nwith these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash\nproceeds of $5.2 billion as of both transfer dates.

It is the Corporation’s policy to\ninclude these derivative instruments in its trading activities,\nwhich include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments.\nThe resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a\nportfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets\nbusiness segment. The related sales and trading revenue\ngenerated within Global Markets is recorded in various income\nstatement line items, including market making and _ similar\nactivities and net interest income as well as other revenue\ncategories.\n\nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value\nand realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other\nassets, net interest income, and fees primarily from\ncommissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the\ndifference in the client price for an instrument and the price at\nwhich the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer\nmarket. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases\nand sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and\nTrading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these\nsecurities are included in market making and similar activities.\nFor debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest\nassociated with the debt securities, is typically included in\n\n138 Bank of America 2020\n\nmarket making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for\nequity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer\nservices for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of\nthe instrument rather than being charged through separate fee\narrangements.

The following table presents gains  (losses) on these derivatives for 2020, 2019 and 2018. These  gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense  recorded on the hedged item.  \nThe table presents financial data in millions of dollars for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018, covering various types of risks faced by a financial entity. The breakdown is as follows:\n\n1. **Interest Rate Risk on Mortgage Activities:**\n   - 2020: $446 million\n   - 2019: $315 million\n   - 2018: $(107) million (a negative figure indicates a loss or reduction).\n\n2. **Credit Risk on Loans:**\n   - 2020: $(68) million\n   - 2019: $(58) million\n   - 2018: $9 million\n\n3. **Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk on ALM Activities:**\n   - 2020: $(2,971) million\n   - 2019: $1,112 million\n   - 2018: $3,278 million\n\n4. **Price Risk on Certain Compensation Plans:**\n   - 2020: $700 million\n   - 2019: $943 million\n   - 2018: $(495) million\n\nNegative values are shown in parentheses, indicating reductions in value or losses. The table omits a specific caption but includes footnotes referenced as (1), (2), (3), and (4), suggesting additional information or context is given elsewhere in the document.\nTransfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained  through Derivatives  \nThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the  transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales  where substantially all of the economic exposure to the  transferred financial assets is retained through derivatives (e.g.,  interest rate and/or credit), but the Corporation does not retain  control over the assets transferred. At both December 31, 2020  and 2019, the Corporation had transferred   $\\S5.2$   billion of non- U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities to a  third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the  transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection  with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash  proceeds of  $\\S5.2$   billion as of both transfer dates. At December  31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of the transferred securities  was  $\\S5.5$   billion and   $\\S5.3$   billion.  \nSales and Trading Revenue  \nThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client  transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading  account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to  include these derivative instruments in its trading activities,  which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments.  The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a  portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s  Global Markets  business segment. The related sales and trading revenue  generated within  Global Markets  is recorded in various income  statement line items, including market making and similar  activities and net interest income as well as other revenue  categories.  \nSales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value  and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other  assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from  commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the  difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at  which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer  market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases  and sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and  Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these  securities are included in market making and similar activities.  For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest  associated with the debt securities, is typically included in  market making and similar activities. Unlike commissions for  equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer  services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of  the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee  arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in market  making and similar activities as part of the initial mark to fair  value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in  market making and similar activities. In transactions where the  Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded  futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.  \n\nThe following table, which includes both derivatives and non- derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the  respective income statement line items attributable to the  Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in  Global Markets categorized by primary risk, for 2020, 2019 and 2018. This  table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding  valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses).  Global Markets  results in  Note 23 – Business Segment Information  are  presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The table  below is not presented on an FTE basis.  \nThe table presents data on sales and trading revenue, broken down by risk type, for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. The revenue is categorized under three sections: \"Market making and similar activities,\" \"Net Interest Income,\" and \"Other,\" with a total for each risk type in the last column. \n\nFor each year, the risk types considered are:\n\n- **Interest rate risk**\n- **Foreign exchange risk**\n- **Equity risk**\n- **Credit risk**\n- **Other risk**\n\nThe table provides the revenue figures in millions of dollars for each risk type and category. Additionally, it calculates the \"Total sales and trading revenue\" by summing the revenues from each category for a given year. \n\nHere are the highlights for each year:\n\n- **2020**: \n  - Total sales and trading revenue amounts to $14,821 million.\n  - The largest revenue contributor is \"Equity risk\" totaling $5,380 million.\n  \n- **2019**:\n  - Total sales and trading revenue is $12,495 million.\n  - Again, \"Equity risk\" is the highest contributor with $4,498 million.\n  \n- **2018**:\n  - Total sales and trading revenue reaches $12,925 million.\n  - \"Credit risk\" contributes the most at $3,520 million.\n\nOverall, the table provides detailed insights into the financial performance for specific risk types across three years.\nCredit Derivatives  \nThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to  facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk  exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an  underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of  referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as  the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer  upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit  events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit  entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as  acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of  referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be  required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has  occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a  specified amount.

Upon adoption of the new accounting standard,\nthe Corporation recorded a $3.3 billion, or 32 percent, increase\nin the allowance for credit losses on January 1, 2020, which\nwas comprised of a net increase of $2.9 billion in the allowance\nfor loan and lease losses and a $310 million increase in the\nreserve for unfunded lending commitments.

Qualitative reserves cover losses that are expected\nbut, in the Corporation's assessment, may not be adequately\nreflected in the quantitative methods or the economic\nassumptions. The Corporation incorporates forward-looking\ninformation through the use of several macroeconomic\nscenarios in determining the weighted economic outlook over\nthe forecasted life of the assets. These scenarios include key\nmacroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product,\nunemployment rate, real estate prices and corporate bond\nspreads. The scenarios that are chosen each quarter and the\nweighting given to each scenario depend on a variety of factors\nincluding recent economic events, leading economic indicators,\ninternal and third-party economist views, and industry trends.\n\nAs of January 1, 2020, to determine the allowance for credit\nlosses, the Corporation used a series of economic outlooks that\nresulted in an economic outlook that was weighted towards the\npotential of a recession with some expectation of tail risk\nsimilar to the severely adverse scenario used in stress testing.\nVarious economic outlooks were also used in the December 31,\n2020 estimate for allowance for credit losses that included\nconsensus estimates, multiple downside scenarios which\nassumed a significantly longer period until economic recovery, a\ntail risk scenario similar to the severely adverse scenario used\nin stress testing and an upside scenario to reflect the potential\nfor continued improvement in the consensus outlooks. The\nweighted economic outlook assumes that the U.S.\nunemployment rate at the end of 2021 would be relatively\nconsistent with the level as of December 2020, slightly above\n6.5 percent. Additionally, in this economic outlook, U.S. gross\ndomestic product returns to pre-pandemic levels in the early part\nof 2022. The allowance for credit losses considers the impact\nof enacted government stimulus, including the COVID-19\nEmergency Relief Act of 2020, and continues to factor in the\nunprecedented nature of the current health crisis.\n\nThe Corporation also factored into its allowance for credit\nlosses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that\nincluded leveraged loans and industries such as travel and\nentertainment, which have been adversely impacted by the\neffects of COVID-19, as well as the energy sector. The\nCorporation also holds additional reserves for borrowers who\nrequested deferrals that take into account their credit\ncharacteristics and payment behavior subsequent to deferral.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 was\n$20.7 billion, an increase of $7.2 billion compared to\nJanuary 1, 2020. The increase in the allowance for credit losses\nwas driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook\nresulting from the impact of COVID-19. The increase in the\nallowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of\n$6.4 billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a\n$755 million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses was attributed to $418 million in the consumer real\nestate portfolio, $1.8 billion in the credit card and other\nconsumer portfolio, and $4.2 billion in the commercial portfolio.\n\nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for\nunder the fair value option decreased $53.9 billion in 2020,\ndriven by consumer loans, which decreased $37.1 billion\nprimarily due to a decline in credit card loans from reduced retail\nspending and higher payments.\n\nBank of America 2020 151\n", "vlm_text": "At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Corporation had   $\\S1.7$  billion and   $\\S2.2$   billion of commercial TDRs with remaining  commitments to lend additional funds to debtors of   $\\S402$  million and   $\\S445$   million.

The allowance for credit losses considers the impact  of enacted government stimulus, including the COVID-19  Emergency Relief Act of 2020, and continues to factor in the  unprecedented nature of the current health crisis.  \nThe Corporation also factored into its allowance for credit  losses an estimated impact from higher-risk segments that  included leveraged loans and industries such as travel and  entertainment, which have been adversely impacted by the  effects of COVID-19, as well as the energy sector. The  Corporation also holds additional reserves for borrowers who  requested deferrals that take into account their credit  characteristics and payment behavior subsequent to deferral.  \nThe allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 was   $\\S20.7$   billion, an increase of   $\\Updownarrow7.2$   billion compared to  January 1, 2020. The increase in the allowance for credit losses  was driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook  resulting from the impact of COVID-19. The increase in the  allowance for credit losses was comprised of a net increase of \n\n  $\\S6.4$   billion in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a \n\n  $\\Updownarrow755$   million increase in the reserve for unfunded lending  commitments. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease  losses was attributed to   $\\S4\\varSigma8$   million in the consumer real  estate portfolio,   $\\S1.8$   billion in the credit card and other  consumer portfolio, and  $\\S4.2$   billion in the commercial portfolio.  \nOutstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for  under the fair value option decreased   $\\S53.9$  driven by consumer loans, which decreased   $\\Updownarrow37.1$   billion  primarily due to a decline in credit card loans from reduced retail  spending and higher payments.

Included in the table are certain structured  notes issued by the Corporation that contain provisions whereby  the borrowings are redeemable at the option of the holder (put  options) at specified dates prior to maturity. Other structured  notes have coupon or repayment terms linked to the  performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or  commodities, and the maturity may be accelerated based on the  value of a referenced index or security. In both cases, the  Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the  obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual  maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as  maturing at their contractual maturity date.  \nThe table displays the long-term debt of Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries for the years 2021 through 2025, along with projections for debt maturing thereafter. The data is shown in millions of dollars.\n\n1. **Bank of America Corporation:**\n   - **Senior notes:** Amounts are given for each year from 2021 ($8,888 million) to 2025 ($15,723 million) and thereafter ($105,903 million), with a total of $191,173 million.\n   - **Senior structured notes:** Amounts range from $469 million in 2021 to $549 million in 2025, with a \"thereafter\" total of $13,194 million, leading to a total of $17,033 million.\n   - **Subordinated notes:** Amounts are $371 million in 2021, $393 million in 2022, and $3,351 million in 2024, with a \"thereafter\" total of $14,484 million, culminating in a total of $24,136 million.\n   - **Junior subordinated notes:** $739 million thereafter, totaling $739 million.\n   - **Total:** The total debt for Bank of America Corporation is $233,081 million.\n\n2. **Bank of America, N.A.:**\n   - **Senior notes:** The amounts range from $1,340 million in 2021 to $8 million thereafter, totaling $2,834 million.\n   - **Subordinated notes:** A total of $1,883 million is mentioned, all of which matures thereafter.\n   - **Advances from Federal Home Loan Banks:** Amounts start at $502 million in 2021, decreasing to $1 million in 2024, and a \"thereafter\" total of $75 million, summing to $599 million.\n   - **Securitizations and other Bank VIEs:** Beginning at $4,056 million in 2021, reducing to $22 million thereafter, totaling $6,296 million.\n   - **Other:** The total is $683 million with varying amounts across the years.\n   - **Total:** Bank of America, N.A.'s total is $12,295 million.\n\n3. **Other Debt:**\n   - **Structured Liabilities:** Starting at $4,613 million in 2021 up to $859 million in 2025, with a \"thereafter\" total of $6,030 million, summing to $16,792 million.\n   - **Nonbank VIEs:** Totaling $757 million all thereafter.\n   - **Other:** An other category totals $9 million thereafter.\n   - **Total Other Debt:** $17,558 million\n\nFinally, the **Total Long-term Debt** across these categories shows:\n- For 2021: $20,352 million\n- For 2022: $22,456 million\n- For \nNOTE 12  Commitments and Contingencies  \nIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a  number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments  expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market  risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk  limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the  Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \nCredit Extension Commitments  \nThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such  as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit  to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following  table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding  lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e.,  syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The  distributed amounts were   $\\S10.5$   billion and   $\\S10.6$   billion at  December 31, 2020 and 2019. The carrying value of these  commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluding  commitments  accounted  for under the  fair value option, was   $\\S1.9$   billion and   $\\S829$   million, which primarily related to the  reserve for unfunded lending commitments. The carrying value  of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and  other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  \n\nLegally binding commitments to extend credit generally have  specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments  have adverse change clauses that help to protect the  Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay.  \nThe  table  below  includes  the  notional  amount  of  commitments of   $\\S4.0$   billion and   $\\S4.4$   billion at December 31,  2020 and 2019 that are accounted for under the fair value  option. However, the table excludes cumulative net fair value of   $\\S99$   million and   $\\S90$   million at December 31, 2020 and 2019  on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses  and other liabilities.

It distinguishes between \"Total share repurchases, including CCAR capital plan repurchases\" and the \"Purchase price of shares repurchased and retired,\" further categorizing the latter into \"CCAR capital plan repurchases\" and \"Other authorized repurchases.\" \n\nHere's a summary by year:\n\n- **2020**:\n  - Total share repurchases (in millions): 227\n  - CCAR capital plan repurchases: $7,025 million\n  - Other authorized repurchases: $0 million\n  - Total shares repurchased: $7,025 million\n\n- **2019**:\n  - Total share repurchases (in millions): 956\n  - CCAR capital plan repurchases: $25,644 million\n  - Other authorized repurchases: $2,500 million\n  - Total shares repurchased: $28,144 million\n\n- **2018**:\n  - Total share repurchases (in millions): 676\n  - CCAR capital plan repurchases: $16,754 million\n  - Other authorized repurchases: $3,340 million\n  - Total shares repurchased: $20,094 million\nDuring 2020, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System (Federal Reserve) announced that due to economic  uncertainty resulting from COVID-19, all large banks would be  required to suspend share repurchase programs in the third and  fourth quarters of 2020, except for repurchases to offset shares  awarded under equity-based compensation plans, and to limit  dividends to existing rates that do not exceed the average of the  last four quarters’ net income.  \nThe  Federal  Reserve’s  directives  regarding  share  repurchases aligned with the Corporation's decision to  voluntarily suspend repurchases during the first half of 2020.  The suspension of the Corporation's repurchases did not  include repurchases to offset shares awarded under its equity- based compensation plans.  \nDuring 2020, the Corporation repurchased and retired 227  million shares of common stock, which reduced shareholders’  equity by   $\\S7.0$   billion.  \nDuring 2020, in connection with employee stock plans, the  Corporation issued 66 million shares of its common stock and,  to satisfy tax withholding obligations, repurchased 26 million  shares of its common stock.

Contributions may be required in  the future under this agreement.  \nThe Corporation’s noncontributory, nonqualified pension  plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension  benefits to certain eligible employees.  \nIn addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits- eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation  as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored  by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the  Postretirement Health and Life Plans.  \nThe Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the  changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the  projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the  accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the  weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit  obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at  December 31, 2020 and 2019. The estimate of the  Corporation’s PBO associated with these plans considers  various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for  mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate  assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique  that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds  with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each  of the plans. The decreases in the weighted-average discount  rates in 2020 and 2019 resulted in increases to the PBO of  approximately   $\\S1.9$   billion and   $\\S2.2$   billion at December 31,  2020 and 2019. Significant gains and losses related to  changes in the PBO for 2020 and 2019 primarily resulted from  changes in the discount rate. "}

The\nmajority of the Corporation's U.K. net deferred tax assets, which\nconsist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management’s\nconclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for\nthe relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward\nNOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could\nlead management to reassess such valuation allowance\nconclusions.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, U.S. federal income taxes had not\nbeen provided on approximately $5.0 billion of temporary\n\ndifferences associated with investments in non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the\nCorporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability,\nthe amount would be approximately $1.0 billion.\n\nNOTE 20 Fair Value Measurements\n\nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as\nthe exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid\nto transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly\ntransaction between market participants on the measurement\ndate. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments under applicable accounting standards that require\nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its\nfinancial instruments into three levels based on the established\nfair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy\nclassifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs\nused in the financial models measuring the fair values of the\nassets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the\ncurrent marketplace. For more information regarding the fair\nvalue hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,\nsee Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The\nCorporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the\nfair value option. For more information, see Note 21 - Fair Value\nOption.\n\nValuation Techniques\n\nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for\nthe Corporation’s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation\nbelieves its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent\nwith other market participants, the use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of\ncertain financial instruments could result in a different estimate\nof fair value at the reporting date.\n\nDuring 2020, there were no significant changes to valuation\napproaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a\nmaterial impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial\nposition or results of operations.\n\nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are\nprimarily based on actively traded markets where prices are\nbased on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.\nThe fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted\nmarket prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a\nsignificant factor in the determination of the fair values of\ntrading account assets and liabilities and debt securities.\nMarket price quotes may not be readily available for some\npositions such as positions within a market sector where\ntrading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of\nthese instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow\nmodel, which estimates the fair value of the securities using\ninternal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk\nmodels that incorporate management's best estimate of current\nkey assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and\nprepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are\ndiscounted using an observable discount rate for similar\ninstruments with adjustments that management believes a\nmarket participant would consider in determining fair value for\nthe specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net\nasset value approach which considers the value of the\nunderlying securities.

The valuation allowance adjusts the deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability. The absence of a valuation allowance for certain categories suggests full expected realizability of those deferred tax assets.\nManagement concluded that no valuation allowance was  necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets related to the U.K.  NOL carryforwards and U.S. federal and certain state NOL  carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be  sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. The  majority of the Corporation’s U.K. net deferred tax assets, which  consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain  subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management’s  conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for  the relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward  NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could  lead management to reassess such valuation allowance  conclusions.  \nAt December 31, 2020, U.S. federal income taxes had not  been provided on approximately   $\\S5.0$   billion of temporary  differences  associated  with  investments  in  non-U.S.  subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the  Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability,  the amount would be approximately  $\\S1.0$   billion.  \n\nNOTE 20  Fair Value Measurements  \nUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as  the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid  to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most  advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly  transaction between market participants on the measurement  date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial  instruments under applicable accounting standards that require  an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize  the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its  financial instruments into three levels based on the established  fair value hierarchy and conducts a review of fair value hierarchy  classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair  value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs  used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the  assets and liabilities become unobservable or observable in the  current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair  value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value,  see  Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles . The  Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the  fair value option. For more information, see  Note 21 – Fair Value  Option .  \nValuation Techniques  \nThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for  the Corporation’s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation  believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent  with  other  market  participants,  the  use  of  different  methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of  certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate  of fair value at the reporting date.  \nDuring 2020, there were no significant changes to valuation  approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a  material impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial  position or results of operations.  \nTrading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities  \nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are  primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are  based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions.  The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted  market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a  significant factor in the determination of the fair values of  trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities.  Market price quotes may not be readily available for some  positions such as positions within a market sector where  trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of  these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow  model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using  internal credit risk, and interest rate and prepayment risk  models that incorporate management’s best estimate of current  key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and  prepayment rates. Principal and interest cash flows are  discounted using an observable discount rate for similar  instruments with adjustments that management believes a  market participant would consider in determining fair value for  the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net  asset value approach which considers the value of the  underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using  external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity  generally are triggered by the market’s perception of credit  uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market  sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on  limited available market information and other factors,  principally from reviewing the issuer’s financial statements and  changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.

The majority of market\ninputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external\nsources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party\npricing services.

The Corporation also incorporates\nFVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs\non uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the\nCorporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An\nestimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of\nfair value, primarily based on market data.\n\nLoans and Loan Commitments\n\nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on\nmarket prices, where available, or discounted cash flow\nanalyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt\ninstruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or\ncomparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow\nanalyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other\nmarket conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\n\nMortgage Servicing Rights\n\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an\noption-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs.

The borrower-specific credit risk is\nembedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by\nconsidering loan performance when selecting comparables.\n\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\n\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons\nor repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity\nsecurities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities.\nThe fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using\nquantitative models for the combined derivative and debt\nportions of the notes. These models incorporate observable\nand, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security\nprices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,\ncommodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs.\nThe Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit\nspread in determining the discount rate used to value these\nliabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to\nobservable spreads in the secondary bond market.\n\nSecurities Financing Agreements\n\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions\nare determined using quantitative models, including discounted\ncash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs\nincluding interest rates and spreads to generate continuous\nyield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of\nmarket inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through\nexternal sources, including brokers, market transactions and\nthird-party pricing services.\n\nDeposits\n\nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative\nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that require the\nuse of multiple market inputs including interest rates and\nspreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and\nvolatility factors.

The Corporation also incorporates  FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs  on un collateralized derivatives and derivatives where the  Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An  estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of  fair value, primarily based on market data.  \nLoans and Loan Commitments  \nThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on  market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow  analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt  instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or  comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow  analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other  market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.  \nMortgage Servicing Rights  \nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an  option-adjusted spread valuation approach, which factors in  prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This  approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under  multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash  flows using risk-adjusted discount rates.  \nLoans Held-for-sale  \nThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices,  where available, or are determined by discounting estimated  cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation’s  current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the  inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is  embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by  considering loan performance when selecting comparables.  \nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  \nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons  or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity  securities, interest rates, indices, currencies or commodities.  The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using  quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt  portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable  and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security  prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency,  commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs.  The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit  spread in determining the discount rate used to value these  liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to  observable spreads in the secondary bond market.  \nSecurities Financing Agreements  \nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,  repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions  are determined using quantitative models, including discounted  cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs  including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous  yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of  market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through  external sources, including brokers, market transactions and  third-party pricing services.  \nDeposits  \nThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative  models, including discounted cash flow models that require the  use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and  spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and  volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively  quoted and can be validated through external sources, including  brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.  The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in  the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by  reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash  market.  \nAsset-backed Secured Financings  \nThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on  external broker bids, where available, or are determined by  discounting  estimated  cash  flows  using  interest  rates  approximating the Corporation’s current origination rates for  similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.

For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield  or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower  fair value.  \nNonrecurring Fair Value  \nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair  value only in certain situations (e.g., the impairment of an  asset), and these measurements are referred to herein as  nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as  of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value  adjustment was recorded during 2020, 2019 and 2018.  \nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  \nThe table presents asset values and gains (losses) in millions of dollars.

Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow  payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting  principal and interest payments to investors.  \nNonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases  that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including  nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been  restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower  experiencing financial difficulties.  \nPrompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the  U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain  levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories  of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” \n\n “under capitalized,”  “significantly  under capitalized”  and \n\n “critically under capitalized.” Insured depository institutions that  fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to  increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability  to make capital distributions, pay management compensation,  grow assets and take other actions.  \nSubprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for  subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not  exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific  product offerings for higher risk borrowers.  \nTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual  terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a  concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties.  Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure  has been extended are also classified as TDRs.  \nValue-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of  a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to  generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR  represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with  a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model  is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and  losses on our trading portfolios.  \nLoan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV  is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan  divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. "}

Shareholders still  receiving printed copies can join our efforts by electing to  receive an electronic copy of the Annual Report and Proxy  materials.
