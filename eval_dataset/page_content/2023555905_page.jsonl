The jurisdictions surveyed were among those with the highest gross domestic product according  to 2021 World Bank data, selected to ensure broadly representative coverage.   \nWe identified 10 countries that do not restrict land ownership by foreigners:  Belgium ,  France Germany ,  Ireland ,  Japan , the  Netherlands ,  Norway ,  Portugal ,  Sweden , and the  United   Kingdom .   \nWe found that the following countries do not permit foreign ownership of land, although  exceptions may apply in some cases or other rights to land may be acquired:  China ,  Indonesia Nigeria ,  Philippines , and  Thailand .   \nAmong the other jurisdictions surveyed, some have restrictions that apply to different types of  land, including agricultural, residential, and commercial land. Other types of restriction are based  on the location of the land, such as near the border or military establishments. Some jurisdictions  restrict particular categories of foreigners from land ownership. Some require special permission  or approval for foreigners before they can acquire land.   \nOwnership of agricultural land by foreigners is restricted by some provinces of  Canada , and by  Egypt ,  India  (restricted for diplomatic personnel, nonresidents of Indian origin and nonresident  citizens without registration),  Iran ,  Poland  (permit required), and  Russia .

Reservation of the ability  to lease or own land to nationals is one such treatment; therefore, it should be listed in the  schedule as a limitation on national treatment.  This applies to services that the GATS covers.    "}

Regulations for real property transactions of foreigners are explicitly exempt from  the competency of the Federation, meaning the nine states have enacted different acts for the  acquisition of real property by foreigners and requirements may vary.  Some states have enacted  specific acts for the acquisition of real property by foreign nationals, such as Vienna,  whereas  others have integrated provisions on foreign nationals into the general real property acquisition  act, such as Tyrol.  Some provinces, such as Styria, do not require an authorization for foreign  nationals depending on the location of the property, for example no authorization is required in  Graz, the capital of Styria.    \nIn general, an authorization for the acquisition of real property by foreign nationals is granted if  there is a “cultural, social or economic interest in concluding the legal transaction” and provided  that it does not contradict national public policy interests, such as establishing a company to serve  as a front for money laundering.
