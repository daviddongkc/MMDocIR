Executive Statement and Mission Statement\n\nMission Statement\n\nThe United States strives to strengthen our partnerships across Africa in ways that serve U.S.\ninterests, African interests, and the interests of people worldwide by promoting sustainable\nprosperity, democracy, and security toward a more peacefuland mutually beneficial future for\nthe people of Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe State-USAID Joint Regional Strategy for Africa (JRS or Strategy) charts a course for\ndevelopmentand diplomacy to mutually reinforce and build on the complementary strengths\nof each organization. State and USAID representa powerful force for positive change and the\ncapacity to build upon networks of institutions and individuals across the continent as well as in\ninternational organizations and the private sector. The JRS articulates a key framework through\nwhich diplomatic, development, and defense efforts can advance shared objectives in an\nintegrated approach to national security. It provides policy guidance to all U.S. government\nagencies and enumerates the core objectives, operational model, and modern architecture\nneeded to implement the policy!.\n\nThe Africa JRS follows the framework of the Interim National Security Strategy (INSS) and the\nstill evolving State-USAID Joint Strategic Plan (JSP) and articulates four strategic U.S.\ngovernment goals for engagementin the region: 1) Advance peace and security in Sub-Saharan\nAfrica through U.S. leadership and revitalized alliances and partnerships to address challenges\nin security, stability, and democracy; 2) Increase mutually beneficial economic growth, trade,\nand investment; 3) Strengthen democracy, uphold universal values, and promote human\ndignity to build strong, accountable, and democratic institutions; and 4) Build Africa’s resilience\nto meet post-pandemic challenges and promote inclusive development.\n\nThe United States cannot achieve our goals around the world—whether that is ending the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, building a strong and inclusive global economy, combating the climate\ncrisis, or revitalizing democracy and defending human rights — without the engagement and\nleadership of African governments, institutions, and citizens. This strategy lays out how the\nUnited States intends to proactively use diplomatic and development resources to partner with\nAfricans across these goals, making it possible to respond to economic shocks and promote\ngrowth; expand U.S.-Africa trade and investment; preventinstability and the spread of violent\nextremism; advance democracy; combat preventable diseases and save lives; create productive\n\n1 Programs and activities implemented by State and USAID in support of the JRS for Africa comply with numerous\nExecutive Orders and policy requirements promoting diversity and inclusion across the spectrum of planning and\nprogramming. Such requirements include conducting gender analyses to inform strategic planning and project\ndesign; disaggregating person-level data by sex and other demographic variablesto help measure and advance\nequity; and tracking annual budget attributions and performance results by a variety of Keylssues in annual\nOperational Plans (OPs) and Performance Plans and Reports (PPRs) to document the promotion of diversityand\ninclusion across the region.\n\nApproved: February 14, 2022 Page 1\nFOR PUBLIC RELEASE\n\n", "vlm_text": "1.

The sheerdiversity across the continent means that the\npeople of Africa experience insecurity differently based on many factors, including\nwhere they live, genderidentity and expression, sexual orientation, age, disability,\nethnicity, religion, class, occupation, and otherintersecting identities. Yet the continent\nhas enormous potential and Africa’s rich marketplace of ideas hold the promise to\nunlock the human potential and agency of all its people.

These largely exogenous  risks were considered by the interagency and reflected in the design of initiatives such  as Prosper Africa and the USAID Africa Trade and Investment Activity, which target both  country-level and transaction-level constraints. This dual focus is itself a risk mitigation  strategy. For example, these interagency initiatives provide support across sectors and  regions, allowing for more flexibility to respond to changes in macroeconomic  conditions and generating tangible benefits for individual businesses regardless of  country-level developments beyond our control. However, we will also work to address  macro-level constraints through partnerships and technical support, for example to the  African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) and other regional economic  bodies.  \nBureau Objective 2.2:    Expand African capacity and technological innovation to foster effective  participation in global markets.  \n•   Bureau Objective 2.2 Justification and Linkages:    Improving capacity to produce and  export goods that are diverse, competitive, and meet global standards will allow African  firms and individuals to access and benefit from global markets. We will work to expand  this capacity by addressing key constraints to infrastructure, technology, and the full  participation of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), entrepreneurs, women,  and marginalized communities in the economy.  \nWhile African womenface significant challenges accessing resources,they provide the  majority   of   labor   input and   are   key    unlocking   the   continent’s   economic   potential.    The UN estimatedin 2016 that gender inequality costs Sub-Saharan Africa    $\\S95$   billion a  year.

We will work to prevent human  rights abuses and atrocities and support transitional justice processes, with a particular  focus on restorative justice mechanisms and longer-term reconciliation. Such support  works togetherto create an inclusive society and fosterrights-respecting reconciliation  that facilitates collaboration between populations and the government and holds both  accountable for abuses.     \nThis objective aligns with JSP Strategic Objectives 3.1 and 3.2.  \nWe will strive to empowerall Africans, with particular emphasis on engaging and  empowering women and youth, as well as systematically marginalized communities, to  constructively shape and participate in their social, political, and economic  environments,including through our many youth- and women-focusedprograms and  exchanges. Civil society continues to face challenges to its role in representing and  advocating for citizens. We will continue to promote and protect the role of civil society  as an essential element of citizen-centered democratic governance. We will support the  development of the institutional architecture to provide survivor-centered support to  victims, enhance equitable access to justice, improve accountability, promote voices  that encourage local dialogue among Africans, foster a diverse civil society, and  recognize the value of independent and responsible media.    \n•   Bureau Objective 3.2 Risk Considerations:    This objective considers the risks of  shrinking democratic space in several countries as well as risks created by remote and  poorly governed spaces across the region.

African countries  and communities face challenges to achieve climate resilience due to the frequency and  magnitude of multiple climate-related shocks and stressors (e.g.,droughts,floods, pests,  extreme heat), the high reliance on sectors and livelihoods that are sensitive to climate  change and natural resource availability (e.g., rainfed agriculture).      \nIn addition, trends in some sub-Saharan African countries, such as population increase,  rapid urbanization, and democratic backsliding will make achieving ambitious climate  goals even more challenging.
