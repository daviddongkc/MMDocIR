The process is depicted as a continuous cycle with five main stages: \n\n1. Assessment\n2. Strategic Planning\n3. Operational Planning\n4. Budget\n5. Management\n\nThese stages are connected in a loop to show the ongoing nature of performance management. In addition, there are two components, \"Evaluation\" and \"Management,\" which likely indicate additional processes or considerations within the system. At the center of the cycle is the label \"Performance Management System,\" indicating that all the stages contribute to this overarching system. Below the cycle, there's a box with the text \"Leadership, Workforce and Infrastructure,\" suggesting that these elements are foundational or significant in the performance management process."}
