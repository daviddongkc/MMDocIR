Corporations seeking to fly drones within  Canada must satisfy the requirements for a “Basic” or “Advanced” license; these classes  are distinguished by the complexity of their corresponding maneuvers, and not the  commercial or recreational nature of their operations. Should commercial drone  activities exceed the limitations of their license class, a Special Flight Operations  Certificate can be obtained on behalf of one’s business.
