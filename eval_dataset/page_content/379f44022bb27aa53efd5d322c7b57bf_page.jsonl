They fuss over me like | was a\npuppy” We observed care being provided in the lounges\nand dining room. The atmosphere was relaxed and people\nlooked at ease.\n\nAlthough people said they felt safe, people were not\nsafeguarded from abuse. The home had a multi-agency\npolicy for the safeguarding of adults in place, but this was\nnot always followed. We identified four records where\npeople had sustained an injury which had not been\ninvestigated or reported in line with the policy.

One person was given ‘as required’ (PRN) pain\nrelief as part of the regular medicines round and was not\nasked if they required this. This could result in them\nreceiving too much pain relief. No pain assessments were in\nuse although there were several people, according to staff,\nwho were not able to verbally communicate if they were in\npain. Staff said some people used hand gestures to show\nhey were in pain. There were no pain care plans to show\nhow each person would indicate this.\n\nOne person’s eye drops which were prescribed twice a day\nhad only been provided once a day for five weeks. Staff said\nhey had missed this. Another person was prescribed a\ncream twice daily but was recorded as receiving it once a\nday. Two people had been prescribed creams which were\nnot being used, and in one case the cream could not be\n‘ound in the home. One person was being given a medicine\nwhich was not detailed on their medicines administration\nrecord (MAR).\n\n7 The Limes Residential Home Inspection report 05/10/2015\n\nStaff said they had been trained in the administration of\nmedicines. The registered manager said they checked staff\ncompetence following training through observations. We\nfound records of observation were not in place for two of\nthe four staff we checked. For staff whose competency had\nbeen checked this covered the administration of medicines\nonly, and not the recording, stock taking, storage or use of\n‘as required’ medicines. The lack of checks meant that staff\nskills and training needs between training sessions were\nnot monitored to ensure safe medicines management in\nthe home.\n\nedicines stocks were not accurate. The stocks of three\nmedicines were found to be incorrect when compared to\nthe records. In two cases there was an excess of the\nmedicine and in the other some tablets were not\naccounted for.\n\nThe home had a medicines policy in place which staff said\nwas based on guidance from the National Institute for\nClinical Excellence (NICE). However, the policy was not\ncomprehensive and, for example, did not cover the storage,\nadministration and recording of creams, or guidance on the\nuse of PRN medicines and how to respond if a person\nregularly refused their medicines. The policy therefore was\nnot comprehensive enough to ensure that people received\ntheir medicines safely from staff who had been trained and\nassessed as competent to do so.\n\nThe failure to manage medicines safely was a breach\nof regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008\n(Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014.\n\nPeople said they were satisfied with staff managing their\nmedicines. We observed part of a medicines administration\nround at lunch time. Medicines were transported safely in a\nlocked trolley and this was kept locked when staff were\nadministering medicines to individual people. Staff\nfollowed safe procedures with a respectful, gentle and\ndiscreet approach when supporting people to take their\nmedicines.\n\nThe registered manager carried out checks on prospective\nstaff to check their suitability to work with older people.\nThese included employment history, a criminal record\ncheck with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and\nreferences from previous employers. Checks were\ncompleted before staff commenced employment.\n\n", "vlm_text": "Is the service safe? \nwandered around the home. One person had successfully exited the building.

The room where medicines were stored was warm and the temperature of the room was not monitored which could result in the effectiveness of the medicines being compromised. \nPeople did not always receive their medicines when required. One person was given ‘as required’ (PRN) pain relief as part of the regular medicines round and was not asked if they required this. This could result in them receiving too much pain relief. No pain assessments were in use although there were several people, according to staff, who were not able to verbally communicate if they were in pain. Staff said some people used hand gestures to show they were in pain. There were no pain care plans to show how each person would indicate this. \nOne person’s eye drops which were prescribed twice a day had only been provided once a day for five weeks. Staff said they had missed this. Another person was prescribed a cream twice daily but was recorded as receiving it once a day. Two people had been prescribed creams which were not being used, and in one case the cream could not be found in the home. One person was being given a medicine which was not detailed on their medicines administration record (MAR). \nStaff said they had been trained in the administration of medicines. The registered manager said they checked staff competence following training through observations. We found records of observation were not in place for two of the four staff we checked. For staff whose competency had been checked this covered the administration of medicines only, and not the recording, stock taking, storage or use of ‘as required’ medicines. The lack of checks meant that staff skills and training needs between training sessions were not monitored to ensure safe medicines management in the home. \nMedicines stocks were not accurate. The stocks of three medicines were found to be incorrect when compared to the records. In two cases there was an excess of the medicine and in the other some tablets were not accounted for. \nThe home had a medicines policy in place which staff said was based on guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). However, the policy was not comprehensive and, for example, did not cover the storage, administration and recording of creams, or guidance on the use of PRN medicines and how to respond if a person regularly refused their medicines. The policy therefore was not comprehensive enough to ensure that people received their medicines safely from staff who had been trained and assessed as competent to do so. \nThe failure to manage medicines safely was a breach of regulation 12 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2014. \nPeople said they were satisfied with staff managing their medicines. We observed part of a medicines administration round at lunch time. Medicines were transported safely in a locked trolley and this was kept locked when staff were administering medicines to individual people. Staff followed safe procedures with a respectful, gentle and discreet approach when supporting people to take their medicines. \nThe registered manager carried out checks on prospective staff to check their suitability to work with older people. These included employment history, a criminal record check with the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) and references from previous employers. Checks were completed before staff commenced employment. "}

Staff were unaware of the person’s end of life wishes, although the care they currently provided the person was described as, “wonderful”, and “couldn’t be better” by the person and their relatives. \nA pleasant and jovial atmosphere was promoted during the lunchtime meal. People sat in a variety of chairs and two people were supported to move to the dining room in wheeled lounge chairs which meant they could join in the social aspect of the meal. Background music played and people appeared to enjoy the meal as they chatted to one another and to staff.

One member of staff discreetly observed a person eating their meal, and only stepped in to provide assistance when they faltered, saying “shall I just cut that up for you, [person’s name]?” The person accepted the help and the staff member then left the person to manage for as long as they could. People had adapted cutlery and crockery, such as plate-guards where they were required. As a result people’s \nindependence to eat and drink was encouraged. People told us they were able to do things alone if they wanted to, such as bathing using their en-suite facility. This was reflected in their care plan which referred to their ability to make choices and decisions, such as when to call a doctor or nurse. \nPeople said they were involved in their care planning and that staff respected their wishes.
