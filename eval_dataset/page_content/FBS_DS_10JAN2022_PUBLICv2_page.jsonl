Information gaps degrade DS ability to understand and adapt to changing security environments, negatively impacting U.S. diplomatic activities around the globe. Incidents of terrorism, crime, and political violence, along with the renewal of great power competition, will drive Bureau efforts to become a more capable, intelligence- driven security and law enforcement organization. \nBureau Goal 3:    Provide high-quality training to equip Department personnel and  others in the foreign affairs community with the skills to safely and successfully  operate in the current threat environments.  \nâ€¢ Bureau Goal 3 Description:   DS is a leader in security training and must ensure the workforce and related stakeholders have the skills to respond to the changing nature of the threat environment worldwide.
