With the growing size of LLMs, they can serve standalone as very effective knowledge stores, with facts encoded within their parameters ( Petroni et al. ,  2019 ;  Jiang et al. ,  2020 ; Talmor et al. ,  2020 ;  Rae et al. ,  2021 ;  Hoffmann et al. ,  2022 ;  Chowdhery et al. ,  2022 ;  Bubeck et al. , 2023 ;  Kandpal et al. ,  2023 ) and models can be further improved with fine-tuning on downstream tasks ( Roberts et al. ,  2020 ). Nevertheless, even a large model does not contain sufficient domain- specific knowledge for particular tasks and the world continues to change, invalidating facts in the LLM. Updating the knowledge of these models through additional fine-tuning or editing is difficult, particularly when dealing with vast text corpora ( Lewis et al. ,  2020 ;  Mitchell et al. ,  2022 ). An alter- native approach, pioneered in open domain question answering systems ( Chen et al. ,  2017 ;  Yu et al. , 2018 ), is to index large quantities of text, after splitting it into chunks (paragraphs), in a separate information retrieval system. Retrieved information is then presented to the LLM along with the question as context (“retrieval augmentation”,  Lewis et al. ,  2020 ;  Izacard et al. ,  2022 ;  Min et al. , 2023 ;  Ram et al. ,  2023 ), making it easy to provide a system with current knowledge particular to some domain and enabling easy interpret ability and provenance tracking, whereas the parametric knowledge of LLMs is opaque and difficult to trace back to its source ( Akyurek et al. ,  2022 ). \nNevertheless, existing retrieval-augmented approaches also have flaws.

Recent advances in hardware and algorithms have indeed expanded the con-\ntext lengths that models can handle, leading to questions about the need for retrieval systems (Dai\net al., 2019; Dao et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2023). However, as Liu et al. (2023) and Sun et al. (2021)\nhave noted, models tend to underutilize long-range context and see diminishing performance as con-\ntext length increases, especially when pertinent information is embedded within a lengthy context.\nMoreover, practically, use of long contexts is expensive and slow. This suggests that selecting the\nmost relevant information for knowledge-intensive tasks is still crucial.\n\nRetrieval Methods Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have seen improvements in\nvarious components: the retriever, the reader, and end-to-end system training. Retrieval methods\nhave transitioned from traditional term-based techniques like TF-IDF (Sparck Jones, 1972) and\nBM25 (Robertson et al., 1995; Roberts et al., 2020) to deep learning—based strategies (Karpukhin\net al., 2020; Khattab & Zaharia, 2020; Sachan et al., 2023). Some recent work proposes using\nlarge language models as retrievers due to their ability to memorize extensive knowledge (Yu et al.,\n2022; Sun et al., 2022). Research on the reader component includes Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)\n(izacard & Grave, 2022), which employs both DPR and BM25 for retrieval and processes passages\nindependently in the encoder and RETRO (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), which utilizes\ncross-chunked attention and chunkwise retrieval to generate text grounded on retrieved context.\n\nEnd-to-end system training work includes Atlas (Izacard et al., 2022), which fine-tunes an encoder-\ndecoder model in conjunction with the retriever; REALM (Guu et al., 2020), a bidirectional, masked\nLM fine-tuned for open-domain question answering; and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Genera-\ntion) (Lewis et al., 2020), which integrates pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models with a neural\nretriever. Min et al. (2021) introduced Joint Passage Retrieval (JPR) model which uses a tree-\ndecoding algorithm to handle passage diversity and relevance in multi-answer retrieval. Dense Hi-\nerarchical Retrieval (DHR) and Hybrid Hierarchical Retrieval (HHR) represent advancements\nin retrieval accuracy by combining document and passage level retrievals and integrating sparse and\ndense retrieval methods, respectively (Liu et al., 2021; Arivazhagan et al., 2023).\n\n'We will release the code of RAPTOR publicly here.\n", "vlm_text": "The image illustrates the tree construction process used by RAPTOR to cluster and summarize text.

BIC not only penalizes model complexity but also rewards goodness of fit\n\n(Schwarz, 1978). The BIC for a given GMM is BIC = In(N)k — 2In(L), where N is the number\nof text segments (or data points), k is the number of model parameters, and L is the maximized\nvalue of the likelihood function of the model. In the context of GMM, the number of parameters k\nis a function of the dimensionality of the input vectors and the number of clusters.\n\nWith the optimal number of clusters determined by BIC, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm\nis then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, covariances, and mixture weights.\n\nWhile the Gaussian assumption in GMMs may not perfectly align with the nature of text data, which\noften exhibits a sparse and skewed distribution, our empirical observations suggest that it offers an\neffective model for our purpose. We run an ablation comparing GMM Clustering with summarizing\ncontiguous chunks and provide details in Appendix B.\n\nModel-Based Summarization After clustering the nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, the\nnodes in each cluster are sent to a language model for summarization. This step allows the model\nto transform large chunks of text into concise, coherent summaries of the selected nodes. For our\nexperiments, we use got-3.5-turbo to generate the summaries. The summarization step con-\ndenses the potentially large volume of retrieved information into a manageable size. We provide\nstatistics on the compression due to the summarization in Appendix C and the prompt used for\nsummarization in Appendix D.\n\nWhile the summarization model generally produces reliable summaries, a focused annotation study\nrevealed that about 4% of the summaries contained minor hallucinations. These did not propagate\nto parent nodes and had no discernible impact on question-answering tasks. For an in-depth analysis\nof hallucinations, refer to the appendix E.\n\nQuerying In this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR:\ntree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered\nRAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. We\nprovide the pseudocode of both methods in Appendix F. Note that we embed all nodes using SBERT.\n\nThe tree traversal method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine\nsimilarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next\nlayer and the top-k nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the\nquery vector. This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes. Finally, the text from all selected\nnodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. The algorithm’s steps are outlined below:\n\n1. Start at the root layer of the RAPTOR tree. Compute the cosine similarity between the\nquery embedding and the embeddings of all nodes present at this initial layer.\n\n2. Choose the top-k nodes based on the highest cosine similarity scores, forming the set 5).\n", "vlm_text": "Given a set of  $N$   text segments, each represented as a  $d$  -dimensional dense vector embedding, the likelihood of a text vector,    $\\mathbf{x}$  , given its membership in the    $k^{t h}$    Gaussian distribution, is denoted by  $P(\\mathbf{x}|k)=\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x};\\mu_{k},\\Sigma_{k})$  .

This two-step clustering process captures a broad spectrum of relationships among the text data, from broad themes to specific details. \nShould a local cluster’s combined context ever exceed the sum mari z ation model’s token threshold, our algorithm recursively applies clustering within the cluster, ensuring that the context remains within the token threshold. \nTo determine the optimal number of clusters, we employ the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model selection. BIC not only penalizes model complexity but also rewards goodness of fit ( Schwarz ,  1978 ). The BIC for a given GMM is    $B I C=\\ln(N)k-2\\ln(\\hat{L})$  , where    $N$   is the number of text segments (or data points),    $k$   is the number of model parameters, and  $\\hat{L}$   is the maximized value of the likelihood function of the model. In the context of GMM, the number of parameters  $k$  is a function of the dimensionality of the input vectors and the number of clusters. \nWith the optimal number of clusters determined by BIC, the Expectation-Maximization algorithm is then used to estimate the GMM parameters, namely the means, co variances, and mixture weights. \nWhile the Gaussian assumption in GMMs may not perfectly align with the nature of text data, which often exhibits a sparse and skewed distribution, our empirical observations suggest that it offers an effective model for our purpose. We run an ablation comparing GMM Clustering with summarizing contiguous chunks and provide details in Appendix  B . \nModel-Based Sum mari z ation After clustering the nodes using Gaussian Mixture Models, the nodes in each cluster are sent to a language model for sum mari z ation. This step allows the model to transform large chunks of text into concise, coherent summaries of the selected nodes. For our experiments, we use    $\\mathtt{g p t\\!-\\!3.5\\!-\\!t u r b o}$   to generate the summaries. The sum mari z ation step con- denses the potentially large volume of retrieved information into a manageable size. We provide statistics on the compression due to the sum mari z ation in Appendix  C  and the prompt used for sum mari z ation in Appendix  D . \nWhile the sum mari z ation model generally produces reliable summaries, a focused annotation study revealed that about   $4\\%$   of the summaries contained minor hallucinations. These did not propagate to parent nodes and had no discernible impact on question-answering tasks. For an in-depth analysis of hallucinations, refer to the appendix  E . \nQuerying In this section, we elaborate on the two querying mechanisms employed by RAPTOR: tree traversal and collapsed tree. These methods offer unique ways of traversing the multi-layered RAPTOR tree to retrieve relevant information, each with its own advantages and trade-offs. We provide the pseudocode of both methods in Appendix  F . Note that we embed all nodes using SBERT. \nThe  tree traversal  method first selects the top-k most relevant root nodes based on their cosine similarity to the query embedding. The children of these selected nodes are considered at the next layer and the top  $\\cdot\\mathrm{k}$   nodes are selected from this pool again based on their cosine similarity to the query vector. This process is repeated until we reach the leaf nodes. Finally, the text from all selected nodes is concatenated to form the retrieved context. The algorithm’s steps are outlined below: \n1. Start at the root layer of the RAPTOR tree. Compute the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the embeddings of all nodes present at this initial layer. 2. Choose the top-  $\\cdot k$   nodes based on the highest cosine similarity scores, forming the set  $S_{1}$  . "}

These experiments aimed to demonstrate the s cal ability and feasibility of RAPTOR on typical hardware. We varied the context length from 12,500 to 78,000 tokens and measured both the token expenditure and the time required to complete the tree-building process, from initial splitting and embedding to the construction of the final root node. \nThe image presents three line plots that show the token cost as a function of document length for three different datasets: QASPER, Narrative QA, and QuALITY. \n\n1. **QASPER** (left plot):\n   - The plot uses red color to represent data.\n   - The horizontal axis shows document length in tokens, ranging from 0 to 30,000.\n   - The vertical axis shows the total number of tokens for both the prompt and completion, ranging from 0 to 40,000.\n   - The graph illustrates a linear increase in token cost as document length increases.\n\n2. **Narrative QA** (middle plot):\n   - The plot uses blue color to represent data.\n   - The horizontal axis shows document length, ranging from 0 to 400,000 tokens.\n   - The vertical axis shows the total number of tokens for both the prompt and completion, ranging from 0 to 600,000.\n   - The graph depicts a linear relationship, with token cost steadily increasing with document length.\n\n3. **QuALITY** (right plot):\n   - The plot uses green color to represent data.\n   - The horizontal axis shows document length, ranging from 0 to 8,000 tokens.\n   - The vertical axis shows the total number of tokens for both the prompt and completion, ranging from 2,000 to 12,000.\n   - The graph demonstrates a generally linear increase in token cost with document length, though fluctuations are more noticeable as compared to the other datasets.\n\nThe caption of the image explains that RAPTOR tree construction costs scale linearly with document length across all three datasets, indicating that the increase in token usage is consistent as document length grows.\nToken Expenditure We empirically investigated the relationship between the initial document length and the total number of tokens expended during the tree-building process, which includes both the prompt and completion tokens. The document lengths varied significantly across the three datasets examined: QuALITY, QASPER, and Narrative QA. Figure  5  illustrates a clear linear corre- lation between the initial document length and the total token expenditure, emphasizing that RAP- TOR maintains a linear token scaling regardless of document complexity or length.

The x-axis represents the length of the document in tokens, ranging from 0 to 80,000. The y-axis represents the time in seconds, ranging from 0 to 1500. The graph indicates that the build time scales linearly with the length of the document for each of the datasets, as stated in the caption. As the length of the document increases, the time taken to build also increases. The data points are plotted and connected with a line to show this linear relationship.\nBuild Time We also empirically observed a consistent linear trend between the document length and the build time, as shown in Figure  6 .

Here is a brief explanation of the pseudocode:\n\n1. **Function Definition**: The function `TRAVERSETREE` takes three arguments: a `tree`, a `query`, and a parameter `k`.\n\n2. **Initialization**: \n   - `S_current` is initialized to the first layer of the tree using `tree.layer[0]`.\n\n3. **Loop through Tree Layers**: \n   - A `for` loop iterates over the number of layers in the tree using `range(tree.num_layers)`.\n\n4. **Processing Nodes in Current Layer**:\n   - An empty list `top_k` is initialized to keep track of the top-k nodes in each layer.\n   - Another loop iterates over each `node` in `S_current`, computing a `score` using the `dot_product` function with `query` and `node` as inputs.\n   - Each node along with its computed score is appended to the `top_k` list as a tuple `(node, score)`.\n\n5. **Select Top-k Nodes**:\n   - `S_layer` is assigned the top-k nodes from `sorted(top_k)[:k].nodes`, where `top_k` is sorted based on scores.\n\n6. **Update Current Layer**:\n   - `S_current` is updated to be the current set of selected top-k nodes, `S_layer`.\n\n7. **Return Statement**:\n   - The function returns the union of sets from all the layers traversed (`S_0 ∪ S_1 ∪ S_2 ... ∪ S_k`).\n\n8. **End of Function**: The function is concluded with an `end function` statement. \n\nThis algorithm likely performs a top-k selection of nodes at each layer of the tree according to some scoring system derived from the `dot_product` of nodes and a query, effectively filtering the tree traversed by prioritizing nodes with the highest scores.\nG Q UALITATIVE  A NALYSIS \nTo qualitatively examine RAPTOR’s retrieval process, we test it on thematic, multi-hop questions about a 1500-word version of the fairytale Cinderella.

The function `COLLAPSEDTREE` is designed to process a data structure, presumably a tree, based on several parameters: `tree`, `query`, `k`, and `max_tokens`. Here's a breakdown of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Flatten the Tree**: The tree is first flattened into a one-dimensional structure using a function `flatten(tree)`.\n\n2. **Calculate Dot Product**: For each node in the flattened tree, a dot product between the `query` and the `node` is computed and stored in a list `top_nodes` along with the node itself.\n\n3. **Sorting**: The `top_nodes` list is sorted, although it is not specified what it is sorted by.\n\n4. **Initializing Result and Token Count**: The algorithm initializes an empty list `result` and sets `total_tokens` to zero.\n\n5. **Iterating Over Top Nodes**: It then iterates over each node in the sorted `top_nodes` list and checks if adding the current node's token size to `total_tokens` would exceed `max_tokens`.\n\n   - If not, the node is appended to the `result` list.\n   - The `total_tokens` is updated by adding the current node's token size.\n\n6. **Return Result**: The function finally returns the `result` list, which presumably contains a subset of nodes from the original tree that maximize some criteria while keeping within a token limit.\n\nThe algorithm essentially collapses a tree into a prioritized list of nodes based on their relevance to a query, constrained by a token limit.\nThe table compares RAPTOR and DPR responses to two questions about the story of Cinderella:\n\n1. **Question: What is the central theme of the story?**\n   - **RAPTOR**: Focuses on the Fairy Godmother helping Cinderella attend a ball, impressing the Prince, losing track of time, and the Prince searching for her. It highlights forgiveness and the finding of the glass slipper.\n   - **DPR**: Describes the magical transformation of animals and objects, Cinderella's attire change, and her need to leave by eleven. It mentions the Prince meeting a mysterious Princess at the ball, unaware it was Cinderella.\n\n2. **Question: How does Cinderella find a happy ending?**\n   - **RAPTOR**: Details the transformation magic, Cinderella impressing the Prince, her need to leave by eleven, and the Prince finding her through the glass slipper.

The data indicate that a substantial portion of the nodes contributing to the final retrieval comes from non-leaf layers, with a notable percentage from the first and second layers, highlighting the importance of RAPTOR’s hierarchical sum mari z ation in the retrieval process. \nThe table presents data relating to three different queries or layers with corresponding values across three different columns labeled as Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes), Layer 1, and Layer 2. Here's a breakdown of the table contents:\n\n1. The first column is labeled \"Layers Queried / Start Layer\" and lists the different scenarios of the layers queried:\n   - 1 layer\n   - 2 layers\n   - 3 layers\n\n2. The second column, \"Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes),\" provides values for each of the scenarios:\n   - For \"1 layer,\" the value is 66.6.\n   - There is no value (indicated by a dash) for \"2 layers\" and \"3 layers.\"\n\n3. The third column, \"Layer 1,\" presents values as follows:\n   - For \"1 layer,\" the value is 61.1.\n   - For \"2 layers,\" the value is 66.6.\n   - There is no value (indicated by a dash) for \"3 layers.\"\n\n4. The final column, \"Layer 2,\" shows:\n   - For \"1 layer,\" the value is 61.1.\n   - For \"2 layers,\" the value is 66.6.\n   - For \"3 layers,\" the value is 83.3, which is also bolded for emphasis.\n\nThe table seems to depict performance metrics or results specific to each layer query scenario across the three layers mentioned.\nThe table shows data related to layers queried or start layers across two main columns: \"Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes)\" and \"Layer 1\". It contains two rows that describe:\n\n1. For \"1 layer\" queried or started:\n   - The value in \"Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes)\" is 94.7.\n   - The value in \"Layer 1\" is 84.2.\n\n2. For \"2 layers\" queried or started:\n   - There is no value for \"Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes)\" (indicated by '-').\n   - The value in \"Layer 1\" is 89.4.\nThe table shows data for different layers queried or start layers, with respective values for \"Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes)\" and \"Layer 1\":\n\n- For \"1 layer\":\n  - Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes): 57.9\n  - Layer 1: 47.3\n  \n- For \"2 layers\":\n  - Layer 0 (Leaf Nodes): Not applicable or missing\n  - Layer 1: 68.4 (in bold)\nI.2 W HICH  L AYERS DO  R ETRIEVED  N ODES COME FROM  ? \nWe further conduct an ablation study across all three datasets and across three different retrievers with RAPTOR with the collapsed tree retrieval to examine the layers from which the retrieved nodes originate. We observe that between  $18.5\\%$   to  $57\\%$   of the retrieved nodes come from non-leaf nodes. As illustrated in Figure  7 , the retrieval pattern across layers reveals the importance of RAPTOR’s multi-layered tree structure. Notably, a significant percentage of the nodes retrieved by RAPTOR using the DPR retriever for the Narrative QA dataset come from the first and second layers of the tree, as opposed to the leaf nodes. This pattern is consistent across the other datasets and retrievers, albeit with varying percentages. \nTable 18: Percentage of nodes from non-leaf nodes across different datasets and retrievers \nThe table presents the performance of three different information retrieval models—DPR, SBERT, and BM25—across three datasets: NarrativeQA, Quality, and Qasper. The values in the table represent the performance percentages of each model on each dataset. Here is the detailed breakdown:\n\n- For the NarrativeQA dataset:\n  - DPR has a performance of 57.36%\n  - SBERT has a performance of 36.78%\n  - BM25 has a performance of 34.96%\n\n- For the Quality dataset:\n  - DPR has a performance of 32.28%\n  - SBERT has a performance of 24.41%\n  - BM25 has a performance of 32.36%\n\n- For the Qasper dataset:\n  - DPR has a performance of 22.93%\n  - SBERT has a performance of 18.49%\n  - BM25 has a performance of 22.76%\n\nOverall, DPR tends to have the highest performance across the datasets compared to SBERT and BM25."}
