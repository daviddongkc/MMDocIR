Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,\nBerkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets — classified on our balance sheet as\nproperty, plant and equipment — than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. That\nsupremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.\n\nAt yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.\nThat number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.\n\n. Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid\n$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.\nAdditionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailable\nassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.\n\nBerkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership between\ngovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning and\nHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, these\nvenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.\n\nThe Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources and\nmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” That\nupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).\n\nI’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the union\nwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholders\nreaped a disaster.\n\nIn the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from\n$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividends\nand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating loss\nas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered an\nextended and non-reversible death march.\n\nDuring the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, the\ncompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period — a pathetic $100 per day.\n\nEarly in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash and\nsteered essentially a// earnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through the\nyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholders\nprospered.\n\nBerkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction.

Our\ncountry would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,\nhowever, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, say\nthanks.\n\n. From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader in\ninsurance “float” — money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively small\nsum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered the\ninsurance business to $147 billion.\n\nSo far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurance\nlosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-year\nprofit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.\n\nOf equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,\nbut their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we can\ntherefore think long-term.\n\nIf you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. To\nmy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire owners\nthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earnings\nand net worth.\n\nMuch of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring of\nAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience had\nbeen. He replied, “None.”\n\nI said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice as\ncould have been made. Better yet, he continues to be — 35 years later.\n\nOne final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely — but far from assured — that Berkshire’s float\ncan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. | am certain, however, that there will\nbe some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.\n\nBerkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer — and that priority will remain long\nafter Charlie and I are gone.\n\nOur Four Giants\n\nThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have a\ncollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,\nranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.\n\n. Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.\nLeading this list is our cluster of insurers.

{"page": 6, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_BRK-A_2021_6.jpg", "ocr_text": "The insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume\nwill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will forever\nbe important. Our company can and will behave well.\n\nThere are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s\noperation, however, would be almost impossible.\n\nApple — our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value — is a different sort of holding. Here,\nour ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But\nconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire funds\nto gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.\n\nIt’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire\nreports — and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted\nto a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act\nwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first\nlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.\n\nBNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an\nindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were\ninstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.\n\nYour railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the\nold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,\namortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” to\nearnings — to use a polite description — have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have\nrisen. Speaking less politely, | would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)\n\nBNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments\nfar exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.\n\nBHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 million\nearned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake.

The product will never be obsolete, and sales volume will generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will forever be important. Our company can and  will  behave well. \nThere are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’s operation, however, would be almost impossible. \nApple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here, our ownership is a mere  $5.55\\%$  , up from   $5.39\\%$   a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. But consider that each    $0.1\\%$   of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to  \\$100 million . We spent  no  Berkshire funds to gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job. It’s important to understand that only  dividends  from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshire reports – and last year, Apple paid us  $\\S785$   million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amounted to a staggering   $\\S5.6$   billion . Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well. BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar. Your railroad had record earnings of \\$6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about the old-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated  after  interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” to earnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks have risen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..) BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishments far exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad. BHE, our final Giant, earned a record  $\\S4$   billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the    $\\S I22$   million earned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns   $91.1\\%$   of the company. BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company had no  wind or solar generation in 2000.

Meanwhile, I arranged to arrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When I made the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, which was released late on the  $22^{\\mathrm{nd}}$  . \nThe market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter, and BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feeling friendly to railroads – or much else. "}

The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance Capital\nStandard”) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standard\nbased on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”).\nThe IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards,\nrisk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC are\nimplementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S.\nstate regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the various\ndomestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for our\ngroup of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college.

GEICO conducts business through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states. \nThe automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for private passenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies that sell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive and USAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in- force of approximately  $26.0\\%$   over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, the five largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately  $59.7\\%$   based on written premiums, with GEICO’s market share being the second largest at approximately   $13.5\\%$  . GEICO’s written premiums in 2020 were reduced by the effects of the GEICO Giveback Program implemented in response to significant reductions in claim frequencies attributable to reduced policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic- related premium credit programs of other private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions, which impacts the industry data reported by A.M Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates its current market share is approximately   $14.2\\%$  . Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant. However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity of automobile claims. \nState insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult for insurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which is substantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketing methods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers.

In order to remain competitive, BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity. \nAs railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies. BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company. Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories served by BNSF Railway. \nUtilities and Energy Businesses—Berkshire Hathaway Energy \nBerkshire currently has a  $91.1\\%$   ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”).

Berkshire’s retailing businesses employed approximately 26,000 people at the end of 2021. Information regarding each of these operations follows. \nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive \nBerkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”) and its affiliates is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, currently operating 105 new vehicle franchises through 82 dealerships located primarily in major metropolitan markets in the United States. The dealerships sell new and used vehicles, vehicle maintenance and repair services, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. BHA also arranges financing for its customers through third-party lenders. BHA operates 28 collision centers directly connected to the dealerships’ operations and owns and operates two auto auctions and a fluid maintenance products distribution company. \nDealership operations are highly concentrated in the Arizona and Texas markets, with approximately   $75\\%$   of dealership-related revenues derived from sales in these markets. BHA currently maintains franchise agreements with 27 different vehicle manufacturers, although it derives a significant portion of its revenue from the Toyota/Lexus, General Motors, Ford/Lincoln, Nissan/Infiniti and Honda/Acura brands. Approximately   $90\\%$   of BHA’s annual revenues are from dealerships representing these manufacturers. \nThe retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and private dealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricing transparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on the same terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speed are key differentiators in attracting customers. \nBHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. The framework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure of BHA’s dealerships. Failure to meet the terms of these agreements could adversely impact BHA’s ability to acquire additional dealerships representing those manufacturers. Additionally, these agreements contain limitations on the number of dealerships from a specific manufacturer that may be owned by BHA. "}

The agreements contain various requirements and restrictions\nrelated to the management and operation of the franchised dealership and provide for termination of the agreement by the\nmanufacturer or non-renewal for a variety of causes. States generally have automotive dealership franchise laws that provide\nsubstantial protection to the franchisee, and it is difficult for a manufacturer to terminate or not renew a franchise agreement\noutside of bankruptcy or with “good cause” under the applicable state franchise law.\n\nBHA also develops, underwrites and administers various vehicle protection plans as well as life and accident and\nhealth insurance plans sold to consumers through BHA’s dealerships and third-party dealerships.

To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the cost of funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected. \nEpidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses. \nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks may adversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses. \nRegulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results. \nOver time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues, regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulation of banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiatives impact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negative impact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economic interests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. \nData privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world. These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our information systems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significant penalties. "}

Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a single\ncatastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employ\nvarious disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possible\ncorrelations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregate\nabove $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate and\nthat our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such as\nlimitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Our\ntolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.\n\nThe degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserves\nmay result in significant underwriting losses.\n\nThe principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property and\ncasualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will take\ndecades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although we\nbelieve that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged for\nthe coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherently\nimprecise.

Legal Proceedings \nBerkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course of business, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly through reinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. "}

The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per\ncar/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020\nreflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our\nutilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. The\nincrease in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a\nbusiness acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax\nbenefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business.\n\nEarnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined\n11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020.\nWhile customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher\nmaterials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration.\n\nOther earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in\n2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by\nKraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-\nlived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in\n2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 related\nto non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance\nCorporation (“BHFC”).\n\nInvestment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our\ninvestments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that\ninvestment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of\nequity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the\neconomic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant\nvolatility in our periodic earnings.\n\nInsurance—Underwriting\n\nOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities — underwriting and investing.\nUnderwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of\nBerkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we\nevaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses.\nWe consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider\ninvestment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not\nmeaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.\n\nThe timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,\nparticularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from a\ncurrent year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods\nin Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.\n\nChanges in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in\nprior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under\nretroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting\nresults may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of\nnon-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate\nfluctuations.\n\nK-33\n", "vlm_text": "Results of Operations  (Continued) \nAfter-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose   $16.1\\%$   compared to 2020 and decreased   $5.8\\%$   in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue per car/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020 reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of our utilities and energy business in 2021 increased   $13.1\\%$   versus 2020 and increased   $8.8\\%$   in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of a business acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased tax benefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business. \nEarnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased   $34.0\\%$   versus 2020 and declined  $11.4\\%$   in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020. While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced higher materials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID- 19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration. \nOther earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of   $\\S259$   million in 2021,  $\\S11.0$   billion in 2020 and   $\\S435$   million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Approximately  $\\S9.8$   billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite- lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in 2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of  $\\S955$   million and after-tax losses of  $\\S764$   million in 2020 related to non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway Finance Corporation (“BHFC”). \nInvestment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from our investments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe that investment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices of equity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating the economic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significant volatility in our periodic earnings. \nInsurance—Underwriting \nOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing. Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility of Berkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, we evaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses. We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we consider investment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are not meaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses. \nThe timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results, particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding  $\\S100$   million from a current year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter. \nChanges in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences in prior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates under retroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately   $\\S125$   billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwriting results may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced  $\\S631$  million in 2021,  $\\S265$   million in 2020 and  $\\S499$   million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of  $\\mathbb{S}167$   million attributable to the pandemic. \nBH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensation insurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experience significant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigation outcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated. \nUnderwriting expenses increased  $\\S485$   million   $(20.4\\%)$   in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business, changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relatively unchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes in business mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture. \nBerkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group \nThe Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverages on property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG.

Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected by prevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the level of competition. \nPeriodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discount accretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality and interest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of   $\\S18$   million in 2021 and losses of  $\\S67$   million in 2020 and  $\\S40$   million in 2019. \nExcluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were  $\\S526$   million in 2021,   $\\S550$   million in 2020 and  $\\S509$   million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by the effects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuity liabilities were  $\\S15.1$   billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately  $3.9\\%$  . \nVariable annuity \nVariable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of   $\\S114$   million in 2021, losses of  $\\S18$  million in 2020 and earnings of  $\\mathbb{S}167$   million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securities markets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization of expected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the net effects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets. \nInsurance—Investment Income \nThe table displays financial data related to investment income for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, along with percentage changes between these years.

However, dividend income showed increases in both annual comparisons. The effective income tax rate declined slightly each year.\nInterest and other investment income declined  $\\S470$   million   $(44.4\\%)$   in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined  $\\S1.0$   billion   $(49.0\\%)$   compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments and fixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. Treasury Bills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021, which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramount and we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments. "}

The decline was primarily\nattributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending and\nstorage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension of\noperations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’s\nconsolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and Engineered\nMaterials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products.\n\nLubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. The\neffects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset by\nlower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire.\n\nMarmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding the\neffects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from the\neffects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologies\ngroups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of business\ndivestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing and\nCrane Services groups.

TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in sales\nvolumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviation\nservices was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies,\nlower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributable\nto the significant increase in flight demand.\n\n2020 versus 2019\n\nService group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81\nmillion (4.8%).

The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations in\nMarch of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. These\ndeclines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG.\n\nThe decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaper\noperations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings decline\nreflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ample\ninventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges and\nrestructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins.

The decline was attributable to COVID-19-related restaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain product categories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2019.

Additionally, we estimate net\npayments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing and\namount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actual\npayments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recorded\nin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.\n\nOther obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations,\nare not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are\ndelivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations\nprimarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and\nBNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the\nnext five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022.

Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant\ndegrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely\nbe adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of\nour principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows.\n\nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses\n\nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim\nliabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet\ndate. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim\nreporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and\nsettlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments\nand assumptions.\n\nAs of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet\nreported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually\nhave relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for\ndecades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal\nenvironment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.\n\nK-58\n", "vlm_text": "Financial Condition  (Continued) \nBNSF’s outstanding debt was   $\\S23.2$   billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020.

We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows. \nOther obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations, are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods are delivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligations primarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE and BNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over the next five years of approximately   $\\S19$   billion, including   $\\S8$   billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire an additional   $41.4\\%$   of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries. Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these commitments. \nCritical Accounting Policies \nCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion of our principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows. \nProperty and casualty insurance unpaid losses \nWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claim liabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheet date. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claim reporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment and settlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgments and assumptions. \nAs of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yet reported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usually have relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending for decades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legal environment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails. "}

Our\nestimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive\nreliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with\nrespect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies.

In 2021, we paid losses and\nloss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.\n\nIn connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception\nrepresents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize\ndeferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of\nloss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim\npayments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have\na significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances.

The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may\ninclude forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and\nother inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in\nperforming impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and\nearnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the\nindefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying\nvalue of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount\nof goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\n\nK-62\n", "vlm_text": "Property and casualty losses  (Continued) \nRetroactive reinsurance \nOur retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates.

Our estimated liabilities for such claims were approximately  $\\S12.3$   billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receive reliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly with respect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we develop estimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reform and legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities. \nWe reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by   $\\S974$   million in 2021, which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of   $\\S142$   million. In 2021, we paid losses and loss adjustment expenses of   $\\S1.9$   billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts. \nIn connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inception represents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortize deferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount of loss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claim payments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may have a significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, we estimate that amortization expense in 2022 will approximate  $\\S950$   million. \nOther Critical Accounting Policies \nOur Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of   $\\S73.9$   billion and other indefinite-lived intangible assets of  $\\S18.5$   billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment. \nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows and earnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amount of goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.

For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss in\nearnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balance\nsheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We consider\nthe severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowance\nfor credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if the\npresent value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may be\nsubsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized loss\nthat we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\n(e) Investments in equity securities\n\nWe carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fair\nvalues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses.\n\n(f) Investments under the equity method\n\nWe utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significant\ninfluence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significant\ninfluence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. This\npresumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercise\nsignificant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investments\nwhen such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.\n\nIn applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the\ncarrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensive\nincome of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the\ninvestment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investments\nin the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additional\nequity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.\n\n(g) Loans and finance receivables\n\nLoans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loans\nand site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowances\nfor expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity.

Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-\ncollection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on the\nnet present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure of\nexpected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit quality\nindicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateral\nrecovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and the\nhistorical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors.

Once a loan is in the process of\nforeclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modification\nis complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off when\nthe collateral is sold.

Each row corresponds to an initial accident year (from 2012 to 2021) and tracks the development of losses over subsequent years. \n\nAdditionally, there is a column titled \"IBNR and Case Development Liabilities,\" which presents the amount reserved for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and development on known cases for each accident year as of 2021.\n\nThe final row of the table provides the total amount for incurred losses and ALAE, which amounts to $27,135.\nThe table appears to present data related to insurance losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ALAE) by accident year. The table tracks the progression of these financial metrics across different years starting from 2012 to 2021. The table is structured as follows:\n\n- The leftmost column labeled \"Accident Year\" lists years from 2012 to 2021.\n- The columns to the right of \"Accident Year\" represent cumulative loss amounts in USD for subsequent development years.\n- Asterisks (*) next to the year in the column headers may indicate estimates or projections for those years.\n- At the bottom of the table, the summary figures are provided for \"Paid losses and ALAE\" totaling $12,212, \"Net unpaid losses and ALAE for 2012 – 2021 accident years\" totaling $14,923, \"Net unpaid losses and ALAE for accident years before 2012\" totaling $8,688, and a final total of \"Net unpaid losses and ALAE\" amounting to $23,611.\n\nThese figures likely represent the progression of claims costs over time, detailing the amounts paid and reserved for insurance claims for each accident year.\nRequired supplemental unaudited average historical claims duration information based on the net losses and ALAE incurred and paid accident year data in the preceding tables follows. The percentages show the average portions of net losses and ALAE paid by each succeeding year, with year 1 representing the current accident year. \nThe table shows the percentage distribution of different insurance categories over ten years.

Generally, no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on future distributions of foreign earnings under current law.

Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company in\nthe world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a business of promises, and Berkshire’s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.\n\nOne reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and pay\nclaims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe workplace accidents, payments can stretch over\nmany decades.\n\nThis collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums — money we call “float” — that will eventually go to others.\nMeanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float an\ninsurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how it\nhas grown, as the following table shows:\n\nYear Float (in millions)\n1970 $ 39\n1980 237\n1990 1,632\n2000 27,871\n2010 65,832\n2018 122,732\n2019 129,423\n\nWe may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual — at the outside no more than 3% in any year. The\nnature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance to\nour cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. That\nstrength will never be compromised.\n\nIf our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds to\nthe investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money — and, better yet, get paid for holding\nit.\n\nFor the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’s because the standard\ninvestment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily — and properly — skewed toward high-grade bonds. Changes in interest rates\ntherefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decade the bond market has offered pathetically low rates.\n\nConsequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced — by maturities or issuer-call provisions — to recycle their “old”\ninvestment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurers could safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on each\ndollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less if their operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-never\nland of negative rates).\n\nSome insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid “alternative” investments promising\nhigher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions are ill-equipped to play.\n\nBerkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled mountain of capital, abundance of\ncash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more investment flexibility than is generally available to other\ncompanies in the industry. The many choices open to us are always advantageous — and sometimes have presented us with major\nopportunities.\n\nOur P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 16 of\nthe last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2 billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gain\ntotaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.\n\nThat record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who know that the rewards of float\ncan be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.\n\nAs I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a sure thing: We will most\ncertainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.\n\nMistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years — even decades — to surface and ripen. (Think asbestos.) A\nmajor catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur — perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The Big\nOne” may come from a traditional source, such as wind or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack having\ndisastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of the\nlosses and they will be big — very big.
