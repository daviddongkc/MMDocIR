Diversifying economies to strengthen regional health security better positions  MENA to prevent and respond to biothreats like COVID-19. Ensuring that women, youth,  and underrepresented populations can meaningfully participate in the formal economy,  particularly to recover from the pandemic and combat the climate crisis, will improve  economic resilience long term. Ensuring that these marginalized communities are  equipped with the necessary skills and education, coupled with the removal of cultural  and legal barriers, results in more inclusive economic opportunities and growth. In turn,  this creates a more responsive and enabling environment which can then be leveraged  to drive   furtherchange. Women’s economic empowerment benefitsall members of   society and is a crucial prerequisite to a sustainable and strong economy, while  increased participation contributes to slowing and reversing the genderand wage gaps  in the workforce. This objective supports key overarching goals including strengthening  global health security, especially among vulnerable populations, and reducing the  gendergap in access to finance, as outlined in JSP Goal 1.1 and 2.2.
