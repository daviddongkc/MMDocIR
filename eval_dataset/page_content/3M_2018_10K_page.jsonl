Discussion of these factors\nis incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of Part I, Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and\nResults of Operations.”\n\n* Results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, and capital markets conditions. The Company operates in more\nthan 70 countries and derives approximately 60 percent of its revenues from outside the United States. The Company’s business is subject to global\ncompetition and geopolitical risks and may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond its control, such as\nslower economic growth, disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions,\ninflation, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, government actions impacting international trade agreements, imposing trade\nrestrictions such as tariffs, and retaliatory counter measures, government deficit reduction and other austerity measures in specific countries or regions, or in\nthe various industries in which the Company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters or\nclimate change affecting the operations of the Company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest\nrates, tax rates, tax laws, or exchange control, ability to expatriate earnings and other regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates.\n\n* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.The Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major\nrating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M. This evaluation is based on a number of factors, which\ninclude financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. 3M currently has\nan AA- credit rating with a stable outlook from Standard & Poor’s and has an A| credit rating with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service. The\nCompany’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. The addition of further leverage to the\nCompany’s capital structure could impact 3M’s credit ratings in the future. Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings would adversely affect the\nCompany’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n\n* The Company’s results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. Demand for the Company’s products, which impacts revenue\nand profit margins, is affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii) the Company’s response to downward\npricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of\ncustomer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the Company’s incentive programs, or the customer’s ability to achieve\nincentive goals; (iv) changes in customers’ preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in\ncustomer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the Company’s products; and (v) changes in the business environment related to\ndisruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence, block-chain, expanded analytics and other enhanced learnings from increasing volume of available\ndata.\n\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company's ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and\nearnings. Because the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are\nderived from outside the United States, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be\nadversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.\n\n10\n\n", "vlm_text": "Forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject torisks and uncertainties.Actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors.

The aggregate net\nimpact of the gain on sale and related restructuring actions increased earnings per diluted share by 2 cents and 50 cents per diluted share for the\nfourth quarter and full year 2018, respectively, and reflects the specific income tax rate associated with these items.\n\nYear 2017 EPS:\n\n2017 divestiture of identity management business:\nIn May 2017, 3M completed the related sale or transfer of control, as applicable of its identity management business and reflected a pre-tax gain\nof $457 million. The earnings per share impact reflects the specific income tax rate used for this divestiture.\n\nOrganic growth/productivity and other:\nOrganic growth/productivity in 2017 included benefits from higher organic local-currency sales, raw material cost decreases from sourcing cost\nreduction projects, and business transformation, which had a positive impact on 3M’s productivity efforts. These benefits were partially offset by\nhigher defined benefit pension service cost expenses. During 2017, organic growth and productivity were the primary drivers for the year-on-year\nbenefit.\nYear-on-year incremental strategic investments decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $413 million in 2017. These incremental strategic\ninvestments are comprised of 3M’s investments in growth initiatives and optimization of its portfolio and supply chain footprint.\n\nAcquisitions/other divestiture gains:\n- Acquisitions and divestitures (other than the sale of the identity management business) had a neutral impact to earnings per diluted share for full\n\nyear 2017. Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, related primarily to the acquisition of Scott\nSafety (fourth quarter 2017). The net impact related to Scott Safety included income from operations, more than offset by the transaction and\nintegration costs of the acquisition. Interest expense related to financing costs of Scott Safety are also included. The net impact related to Scott\nSafety was equivalent to a year-on-year decrease of 7 cents per diluted share. Full year 2017 had year-on-year operating income impacts from the\nfollowing divestitures: Polyfoam and the remaining portion of the library system business (both in first quarter 2016), protective films business\nand cathode battery technology out-license business (both in fourth quarter 2016), prescription safety eyewear business (January 2017), tolling\nand automated license/number plate recognition business (second quarter of 2017), and electronic monitoring business (fourth quarter 2017). The\n\nincremental year-on-year pre-tax gain on divestiture impact, net of lost operating loss/(income) during 2017 was an increase of approximately 7\ncents per diluted share.\n\nForeign exchange impacts:\n- Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased pre-tax earnings by approximately $111 million year-on-year in 2017, excluding the impact\nof foreign currency changes on tax rates.

Selling prices were flat year-on-year for 2017. In Asia Pacific, strong volume growth in electronics had a\nnegative impact on price. Latin America/Canada and EMEA had price growth, while the U.S. selling prices declined slightly.\n\nFinancial condition:\n\n3M generated $6.4 billion of operating cash flow in 2018, an increase of $199 million when compared to 2017. This followed a decrease of $422 million\nwhen comparing 2017 to 2016. Refer to the section entitled “Financial Condition and Liquidity” later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash\nflows. In November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, which replaced the\nCompany’s February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased $4.9 billion of its own\nstock, compared to purchases of $2.1 billion in 2017 and $3.8 billion in 2016. The Company expects to purchase $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion of its own stock\nin 2019. In February 2019, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2019 dividend of $1.44 per share, an increase of 6 percent. This marked the\n61st consecutive year of dividend increases for 3M. The Company has an AA- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from Standard & Poor’s and an Al\n\ncredit rating, with a stable outlook, from Moody’s Investors Service. The Company generates significant ongoing cash flow and has proven access to capital\nmarkets funding throughout business cycles.\n\nRaw materials:\n\nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy\nproductivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and\nmulti-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the\nCompany is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future\nshortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful\nmanagement of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources.\n3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\nPension and postretirement defined benefit/contribution plans:\n\nOn a worldwide basis, 3M’s pension and postretirement plans were 89 percent funded at year-end 2018. The primary U.S. qualified pension plan, which is\napproximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded. The U.S.\nnon-qualified pension plan is not funded due to tax considerations and other factors.

These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps. \nPension and post retirement defined benefit/contribution plans: \nOn a worldwide basis,3M's pension and post retirement plans were 89 percent funded atyear-end 2018.The primary U.S.qualified pension plan,which is approximately 67 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded and the international pension plans were 89 percent funded.

The benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefits that employees are entitled to in the future for services already rendered as of\nthe measurement date.

Here's a breakdown of the contents:\n\n1. **Net Income and Adjustments**:\n   - It starts with \"Net income including non-controlling interest\" for each year.\n   - Next, it includes the \"Interest expense (after-tax)\" for each year.\n   - From these, \"Adjusted net income (Return)\" is calculated.\n\n2. **Invested Capital Calculation**:\n   - \"Average shareholders' equity (including non-controlling interest)\" for each year is listed.\n   - \"Average short-term and long-term debt\" values are provided, which help in calculating \"Average invested capital.\"\n\n3. **ROIC Calculation**:\n   - The table then details the \"Return on invested capital (non-GAAP measure)\" percentage for each year.\n\n4. **Tax Rate for Interest Expense**:\n   - It also provides the \"Effective income tax rate used for interest expense\" for each year.\n\n5. **Average Equity Calculation**:\n   - There's a section labeled \"(2) Calculation of average equity,\" breaking down the \"Ending total equity\" at the end of each quarter.\n   - The \"Average total equity\" is calculated from these quarterly figures.\n\n6. **Average Debt Calculation**:\n   - Similarly, \"(3) Calculation of average debt\" section provides details of the \"Ending short-term and long-term debt\" as of specified dates.\n   - The \"Average short-term and long-term debt\" is calculated from these figures.\n\nOverall, the table organizes these values across three consecutive years to provide insights into the company's financial performance, focusing particularly on how effectively it generates returns from its invested capital."}

The Company recorded an early debt extinguish ment charge of  $\\S96$  million in the fourth quarter of 2017 within interest expense associated with the differential between the carrying value and the amount paid to acquire the tendered notes and related expenses. \n2016Debt Activity. \nTotal debt at December 31, 2016 increased \\$853 million when compared to year-end 2015, with the increase primarily due to May 2016 debt issuances (approximately \\$1.1 billion at issue date exchange rates) and September 2016 debt issuances of approximately \\$1.75 billion. This increase was partially  $\\S1$  offset by the repayment of billion aggregate principal amount of medium-term notes due September 2016 along with the net impact of repayments and borrowings by international subsidiaries, primarily Japan and Korea (approximately  $\\S0.8$  million decrease), which is reflected in “Change in short-term debtnet”in the preceding table.Foreign exchange rate changes also impacted debt balances \nProceeds from debt for 2016 primarily related to the May 2016 issuance of 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 5.75-year fixed rate medium- term notes due February 2022 with a coupon rate of  $0.375\\%$  and 500 million Euro aggregate principal amount of 15-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2031 with a coupon rate of  $1.50\\%$   In September 2016, 3M issued  $\\S600$  million aggregate principal amount of five-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2021 with a coupon rate of  $1.625\\%$   $\\S650$  million aggregate principal amount of 10-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2026 with a coupon rate of  $2.250\\%$  and  $\\S500$  million aggregate principal amount of 30-year fixed rate medium-term notes due 2046 with a coupon rate of  $3.125\\%$  .All of these 2016 issuances were under the medium-term notes program (Series F). \nRepurchase s of Common Stock: \nRepurchase s of common stock are made to support the Company's stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. In November 2018, 3M's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to  $\\S10$  billion of 3M's outstanding common stock, which replaced the  $\\S4.9$  Company's February 2016 repurchase program. This program has no pre-established end date. In 2018, the Company purchased billion of itsown  $\\S2.1$  stock,compared to purchases of billion and \\$3.8 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company expects full-year 2019 gross share repurchase s to be between  $\\S2.0$  billion to \\$4.0 billion.

Cost of securities sold use the first in,\nfirst out (FIFO) method. The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M\nreviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by ASC 320, Investments-Debt and\nEquity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “other-than-temporary”. A temporary impairment charge results\nin an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders’ equity. Such an unrealized loss does not\nreduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate\nbetween temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the\nunderlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or\n“other-than-temporary” impairment.\n\nInvestments: As described in the “New Accounting Pronouncements” section, 3M adopted ASU No. 2016-01 Recognition and Measurement of Financial\nAssets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for\nunder the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity\ninvestments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions. The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7.\n\nOther assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and\nother long-term assets. Investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any\nchanges in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid.

Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment: Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal direct engineering costs, are recorded at cost.\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. The\nestimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from ten to forty years, with the majority in the range of twenty to forty years. The\nestimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to fifteen years, with the majority in the range of five to ten years. Fully\ndepreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts\nuntil disposal. Upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal,\nis charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of\nan asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. The amount of the\nimpairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted\ncash flow analysis.\n\nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of\ntangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations\nexist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. Over time the\nliabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related\nassets. The asset retirement obligation liability was $122 million and $106 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nGoodwill: Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business\ncombination. Goodwill is not amortized. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between\nannual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is done\nat a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.

The classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is based on the availability for use in current operations. 3M reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by AsC 32o, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as “temporary”or “other-than-temporary\". A temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders?equity. Such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. The factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors. Amounts are reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and into earnings upon sale or \"other-than-temporary\"impairment. \nInvestments:As described in the\"New Accounting Pronouncements\"section,3 M adopted AS UNo.2016-01,Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, all equity securities that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in net income. 3M utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions.The balance of these securities is disclosed in Note 7. \n Other assets: Other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivable s, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and otherlong-term assets.Investments in life insurance are reported atthe amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date,with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. Cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in“Purchases of marketable securities and investments”and Proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments,\"respectively \nInventories:Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value (NRV), which is defined as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation market.

Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal.Upon disposal,assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount,less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. Property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated un discounted future cashflows expected toresult from the use ofthe asset and its eventual disposition.The amount ofthe impairment loss recorded is calculated by theexcess ofthe asset's carrying value over its fair value.Fair value is generally determined using a discountec cash flow analysis \nConditional asset retirement obligations: A liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the Company. The obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques.

Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect (2.9 million average options for 2018, 0.8 million average options for 2017, and 3.6million average options for 2016).The computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31 follow: \nThe table presents financial data for 3M, highlighting net income and earnings per share (EPS) for the years 2018, 2017, and 2016.\n\n1. **Net Income Attributable to 3M:**\n   - 2018: $5,349 million\n   - 2017: $4,858 million\n   - 2016: $5,050 million\n\n2. **Denominator for Weighted Average Shares:**\n   - **Basic Shares Outstanding:**\n     - 2018: 588.5 million\n     - 2017: 597.5 million\n     - 2016: 604.7 million\n   - **Dilution from Stock-based Compensation:**\n     - 2018: 13.5 million\n     - 2017: 15.2 million\n     - 2016: 14.0 million\n   - **Diluted Shares Outstanding:**\n     - 2018: 602.0 million\n     - 2017: 612.7 million\n     - 2016: 618.7 million\n\n3. **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**\n   - **Basic:**\n     - 2018: $9.09\n     - 2017: $8.13\n     - 2016: $8.35\n   - **Diluted:**\n     - 2018: $8.89\n     - 2017: $7.93\n     - 2016: $8.16\n\nThese figures provide insights into 3M's financial performance over the three-year period.\nStock-based compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, and the General Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP). Under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests.However,with respect "}

Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a\nhierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring\nthat the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability\ndeveloped based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s\nassumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the\ncircumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels. Level | inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or\nliabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in\nmarkets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are\nunobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the\nfair value measurement.\n\nAcquisitions: The Company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with ASC 805,Business Combinations. This standard requires the acquiring\nentity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date\nfair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination.

Prior periods have not been restated. Due to the cumulative\nnet impact of adoption, the January 1, 2018 balance of retained earnings was increased by less than $2 million, primarily relating to the accelerated\nrecognition for software installation service and training revenue.\n\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 ,Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which revises the\naccounting related to (1) the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and (2) the presentation of certain fair value changes for\nfinancial liabilities measured at fair value. The ASU also amends certain disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The\nnew guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in equity securities and other ownership interests in an entity, including investments in\npartnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies (collectively, equity securities) that do not result in consolidation and are not\naccounted for under the equity method. Entities will need to measure these investments and recognize changes in fair value in net income. Entities will no\nlonger be able to recognize unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities they classify under current guidance as available-for-sale in other\ncomprehensive income (OCI). They also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity securities that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values. Instead, for these types of equity investments that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient, entities will\nbe permitted to elect a practicability exception and measure the investment at cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes (in orderly\ntransactions). The ASU also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value changes of financial\nliabilities for which the fair value option (FVO) has been elected. Under this guidance, an entity would be required to separately present in OCI the portion\nof the total fair value change attributable to instrument-specific credit risk as opposed to reflecting the entire amount in earnings. This provision does not\napply to derivative instruments required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. For 3M, this standard was\neffective beginning January 1, 2018 via an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings, except for guidance relative to equity\nsecurities without readily determinable fair values which is applied prospectively.

The new standard introduces a lessee model that would\nrequire entities to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases, but recognize expenses on their income statements in a manner similar to current\naccounting. The ASU does not make fundamental changes to existing lessor accounting. However, it modifies what qualifies as a sales-type and direct\nfinancing lease and related accounting and aligns a number of the underlying principles with those of the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, such as\nevaluating how collectability should be considered and determining when profit can be recognized. The guidance eliminates existing real estate-specific\nprovisions and requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. For 3M, the ASU is effective January 1, 2019. As amended, the ASU provides\nfor retrospective transition applied to earliest period presented or an adoption method by which entities would not need to recast the comparative periods\npresented. 3M does not plan on recasting prior periods as it adopts this ASU. 3M has conducted analyses, executed project management relative to the\nprocess of adopting this ASU including implementing a new lease accounting system, conducted detailed contract reviews, considered expanded disclosure\nrequirements, and assessed internal controls impacts.

The ASU indicates\nthat the current exception to income tax accounting that requires companies to defer the income tax effects of certain intercompany transactions would\napply only to intercompany inventory transactions. That is, the exception would no longer apply to intercompany sales and transfers of other assets (e.g.,\nintangible assets). Under the existing exception, income tax expense associated with intra-entity profits in an intercompany sale or transfer of assets is\neliminated from earnings. Instead, that cost is deferred and recorded on the balance sheet (e.g., as a prepaid asset) until the assets leave the consolidated\ngroup. Similarly, the entity is prohibited from recognizing deferred tax assets for the increases in tax bases due to the intercompany sale or transfer.

The ASU requires\nan entity to evaluate if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar\nidentifiable assets; if so, the set of transferred assets and activities (collectively, the set) is not a business. To be considered a business, the set would need\n\nto include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of\noutputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets\nare expected to be considered businesses. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018 on a prospective basis and the Company will apply this guidance\nto applicable transactions after the adoption date.\n\nIn February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05,Clarifving the Scope of Asset Derecognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of\nNonfinancial Assets. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09Revenue from\nContracts with Customers. The new standard clarifies the accounting for derecognition of nonfinancial assets and defines what is considered an in\nsubstance nonfinancial asset. Nonfinancial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and intellectual property that do not constitute a business.\nThe new ASU impacts entities derecognizing (e.g. selling) nonfinancial assets (or in substance nonfinancial assets), including partial interests therein, when\nthe purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, the seller would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers, even though the purchaser is not a customer. For 3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the\nCompany’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09.\n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-07,Jmproving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit\nCost. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost\nin the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and\nonly the service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory. All other net periodic benefit costs components (such as\ninterest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) would be reported outside of operating income.\n3M adopted this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component\nis applied on prospective basis. The Company previously filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 8, 2018 (which updated 3M’s 2017 Annual Report\non Form 10-K) that provided prior period information reflecting the retrospective adoption of this ASU. The adoption had no impact on previously reported\nincome before income taxes and net income attributable to 3M.

To be considered a business, the set would need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The standard also narrows the definition of outputs. The definition of a business affects areas of accounting such as acquisitions, disposals and goodwill. Under the new guidance, fewer acquired sets are expected tobe considered businesses.For3M,thisASUwas effective January 1,2018 on a prospective basis and the Company will apply this guidance to applicable transactions after the adoption date. \nIn February 2017,the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05,Clarifying the Scope of Asset De recognition Guidance and Accounting for Partial Sales of Non financial Assets. This ASU addresses scope-related questions that arose after the FASB issued its revenue guidance in ASU No. 2014-09Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new standard clarifies the accounting for de recognition of non financial assets and defines what is considered an in substance non financial asset. Non financial assets largely relate to items such as real estate, ships and intellectual property that do not constitute a business. The new ASU impacts entities de recognizing (e.g. selling) non financial assets (or in substance non financial assets), including partial interests therein, when the purchaser is not a customer. Under the new guidance, the seller would apply certain recognition and measurement principles of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,even though the purchaser is not acustomer.For 3M,this new standard was effective coincident with the Company'sJanuary1,2018 adoption of AS UNo.2014-09. \nIn March 2017,the F AS B issued AS UNo.2017-07,Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Post retirement Benefit Cost. This ASU changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and/or other post retirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement. Under the new standard, only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost would be included in operating expenses and only the service cost component would be eligible for capitalization into assets such as inventory.All other net periodic benefit costs components(such as interest, expected return on plan assets, prior service cost amortization and actuarial gain/loss amortization) would be reported outside of operating income. 3M adopted this ASU is effective January 1, 2018 on a retrospective basis; however, guidance limiting the capitalization to only the service cost component is applied on prospective basis. The Company previously filed a Current Report on Form 8-K dated May 8, 2018 (which updated 3M's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K) that provided prior period information reflecting the retrospective adoption of this ASU. The adoption had no impact on previously reported income before income taxes and net income attributable to 3M. However, non-service cost components of net periodic benefit costs in prior periods were reclassified from operating expenses "}

The financial information herein reflects these impacts for all periods\npresented. The prospective impact on costs capitalized into assets was not material.\n\nIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08 Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities, which amends the amortization period\nfor certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. Under existing standards, entities generally amortize the premium as an adjustment of\nyield over the contractual life of the instrument. The new guidance shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt\nsecurities that have explicit, noncontingent call features and are callable at a fixed price and preset date. The amendments do not require an accounting\nchange for securities held at a discount. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019 with a modified retrospective transition resulting in a cumulative-\neffect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. 3M’s marketable security portfolio\nincludes very limited instances of callable debt securities held at a premium. As a result, the Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact\non 3M’s consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09 Scope of Modification Accounting, that clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based\npayment award must be accounted for as a modification. The general model for accounting for modifications of share-based payment awards is to record\nthe incremental value arising from the changes as additional compensation cost. Under the new standard, fewer changes to the terms of an award would\nrequire accounting under this modification model. For 3M, this ASU was effective January 1, 2018. Because the Company does not typically make changes\nto the terms or conditions of its issued share-based payment awards, the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its consolidated results of\noperations and financial condition.\n\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-10,Determining the Customer of the Operation Services, that clarifies how an operating entity determines\n\nthe customer of the operation services for transactions within the scope of a service concession arrangement. Service concession arrangements are typically\nagreements between a grantor and an operating entity whereby the operating entity will operate the grantor’s infrastructure (i.e. airports, roadways, bridges,\nand prisons) for a specified period of time. The operating entity also may be required to maintain the infrastructure and provide capital-intensive\nmaintenance to enhance or extend its life. In such arrangements, typically the operation services (i.e. operation and maintenance of a roadway) would be\nused by third parties (i.e. drivers). The ASU clarifies that the grantor, not the third party, is the customer of the operation services in such arrangements. For\n3M, this new standard was effective coincident with the Company’s January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. Because the Company is not typically a\nparty to agreements within the scope of accounting for service concession arrangements, the adoption of this ASU had no material impact on its\nconsolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn July 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-11,(Part I) Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Down Round Features, (Part II) Replacement\nof the Indefinite Deferral for Mandatorily Redeemable Financial Instruments of Certain Nonpublic Entities and Certain Mandatorily Redeemable\nNoncontrolling Interests with a Scope Exception. The new standard applies to issuers of financial instruments with down-round features. A down-round\nprovision is a term in an equity-linked financial instrument (i.e. a freestanding warrant contract or an equity conversion feature embedded within a host debt\nor equity contract) that triggers a downward adjustment to the instrument’s strike price (or conversion price) if equity shares are issued at a lower price (or\nequity-linked financial instruments are issued at a lower strike price) than the instrument’s then-current strike price. The purpose of the feature is typically\nto protect the instrument’s counterparty from future issuances of equity shares at a more favorable price. The ASU amends (1) the classification of such\ninstruments as liabilities or equity by revising the certain guidance relative to evaluating if they must be accounted for as derivative instruments and (2) the\nguidance on recognition and measurement of freestanding equity-classified instruments. For 3M, this ASU is effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption\npermitted. Because the Company has not issued financial instruments with down-round features, 3M does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on\nits consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12,Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities and in October 2018, issued ASU No.\n2018-16, which amended the standard. The ASU amends existing guidance to simplify the application of hedge accounting in certain situations and allow\ncompanies to better align their hedge accounting with their risk management activities. Existing standards contain certain requirements for an instrument to\nqualify for hedge accounting relative to initial and ongoing assessments of hedge effectiveness. While an initial quantitative test to establish the hedge\nrelationship is highly effective would still be required, the new ASU permits subsequent qualitative assessments for certain hedges instead of a quantitative\ntest and expands the timeline for performing the initial quantitative assessment. The ASU also simplifies related accounting by eliminating the requirement\nto separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness.

Therefore, the Company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.\n\nThe Company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the December 31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement\nbenefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated\nliabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The Company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt\ninstruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. Using this methodology, the Company\ndetermined a discount rate of 4.36% for the U.S. pension plans and 4.41% for the postretirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which is an\nincrease of 0.68 percentage points and 0.62 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of December 31, 2017. An increase in the discount rate\nlowers the Projected Benefit Obligation (PBO), the significant increase in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018 resulted in an approximately $1.2\nbillion lower PBO for the U.S. pension plans. For the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which\nthe associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. If the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the Company matches the\nexpected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond\ninformation. In countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate\ncorporate bond yields.\n\nThe Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation. Service costs\nare determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows. The interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration-\nspecific spot rates to the year-by-year projected benefit payments. The spot yield curve approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit\nobligations as the change in service and interest costs offset in the actuarial gains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nFor the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the Company’s assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 7.25% in 2018.

The expected return assumption is based on\nthe strategic asset allocation of the plan, long term capital market return expectations and expected performance from active investment management. The\n2018 expected long-term rate of return is based on an asset allocation assumption of 23% global equities, 14% private equities, 47% fixed-income\nsecurities, and 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, along with positive returns from active investment\nmanagement. The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2018 was -0.5%. In 2017 the plan earned a rate of return of 12.4% and in 2016 earned a return of\n5.8%.

Here's an overview of its components:\n\n1. **Asset Classes**: The table organizes assets into categories such as Equities, Fixed Income, Private Equity, Absolute Return, and Cash and Cash Equivalents.\n\n2. **Levels of Inputs**:\n   - **Level 1**: Includes assets with observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets.\n   - **Level 2**: Involves assets with observable inputs other than quoted prices, for instance, quoted prices for similar assets.\n   - **Level 3**: Consists of assets with unobservable inputs, which require significant management judgment or estimation.\n\n3. **Equities**: Includes Growth equities, Value equities, Core equities, and Equities valued at net asset value, showing values across the input levels.\n\n4. **Fixed Income**: Consists of Domestic government, Foreign government, Corporate debt securities, and Fixed income securities valued at net asset value.\n\n5. **Private Equity**: Comprises Real estate, Real estate valued at net asset value, and Partnership investments.\n\n6. **Absolute Return**: Encompasses Derivatives, Insurance, Other, and Hedge funds, and shows how these are valued.\n\n7. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Lists Cash and cash equivalents, and those valued at net asset value.\n\n8. **Totals**: The table provides subtotals for each main category (Equities, Fixed Income, Private Equity, Absolute Return, and Cash and Cash Equivalents) and a grand total of fair value measurements for both years.\n\n9. **Fair Value at Dec. 31**: Shows the total fair value of each asset class as of December 31st for 2018 and 2017.\n\nOverall, this table offers a detailed view of how different categories of assets are valued under various input assumptions over the specified time periods.\n $^*\\mathrm{In}$  accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding and is determined by the investment manager or custodian of the fund. The fair value amounts presented in this table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the fair value of plan assets. "}

Fair Value Measurements\n\n3M follows ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nand nonrecurring basis. Under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. The standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs\nbe used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained\nfrom sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the factors market participants\nwould use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three\nlevels. Level | inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar\nassets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted\nprices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nCategorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\n\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis:\n\nFor 3M, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities and certain\nderivative instruments. Derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and net investment hedges.

Derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. Industry standard data providers are 3M's primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counter party quotes and a net present value stream of cash flowsmodel \nThe table provides financial information about assets and liabilities valued at fair market value as of December 31, 2018. It categorizes these into different types and further breaks down the valuation using three levels of inputs (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) for fair value measurement.\n\n### Assets\n1. **Available-for-sale:**\n   - **Marketable securities:**\n     - Commercial paper: $366 million, all valued using Level 2 inputs.\n     - Certificates of deposit/time deposits: $10 million, also valued using Level 2 inputs.\n\n   - **Asset-backed securities:**\n     - Automobile loan related: $1 million, valued using Level 2 inputs.\n     - U.S. municipal securities: $40 million, valued using Level 3 inputs.\n\n2. **Derivative instruments — assets:**\n   - Foreign currency forward/option contracts: $127 million, all valued using Level 2 inputs.\n   - Interest rate swap contracts: $19 million, mostly valued using Level 2 inputs, with $3 million in Level 3.\n\n### Liabilities\n1. **Derivative instruments — liabilities:**\n   - Foreign currency forward/option contracts: $22 million, all valued using Level 2 inputs.\n   - Interest rate swap contracts: $31 million, all valued using Level 2 inputs.\n\nThis table highlights the distribution of assets and liabilities across different categories, with most valuations relying on Level 2 inputs, indicating that these values are based on observable market data, although not directly from quoted market prices (Level 1), while some are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3)."}

{"page": 110, "image_path": "doc_images/3M_2018_10K_110.jpg", "ocr_text": "Table of Contents\n\nThe following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the Company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated\ninsurance receivables the Company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.\n\nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Litigation\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to\nrepresent approximately 2,320 individual claimants, compared to approximately 2,230 individual claimants with actions pending at December 31, 2017.\n\nThe vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and\nrespirator products and seek damages from the Company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal\nmine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. A minority of the lawsuits and\nclaims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products\npreviously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company\npremises.\n\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects\nthat filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims\nalleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than\nin the past. Over the past twenty years, the Company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described\nbelow). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits — one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court\nin December — both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury\nin state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of\napproximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company has appealed. The\nCompany believes liability in this case is not probable and estimable. In June 2018, the Company also settled a number of coal mine dust lawsuits for an\namount that was not material to the Company.\n\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended\nmanner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if\nsignificant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of\npersons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of\nunimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it\nexperienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants.\n\nAs previously reported, the State of West Virginia, through its Attorney General, filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other\nmanufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended\ncomplaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker’s\ncompensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive\nfrom the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In November 2013, the State filed a motion to\nbifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit.

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises. \nThe Company's current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty years, the Company has prevailed in fourteen of the fifteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits - one in California state court in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December - both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs against asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found  $3\\mathrm{M}^{\\ast}\\mathrm{s}~8710$  respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded compensatory damages of approximately  $\\S2$  million and punitive damages totaling \\$63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company has appealed. The Company believes liability in this case is not probable and estimable. In June 2018, the Company also settled a number of coal mine dust lawsuits for an amount that was not material to the Company. \nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company's respiratory protection products. Nonetheless the Company's litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically unimpaired claimants. \nAs previously reported,theState of West Virginia,through its Attorney General,filed a complaint in 2003 against the Company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the Circuit Court of Lincoln County, West Virginia, and amended its complaint in 2005. The amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the State for worker's compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. The case was inactive from the fourth quarter of 2007 until late 2013, other than a case management conference in March 2011. In November 2013,the State filed a motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damages proceedings. At the hearing on the motion, the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit. No liability has been recorded for this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. In addition, the Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery responses by the State of West Virginia, the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendant's share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault, if any, a jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried. \nRespirator Mask/Asbestos Liabilities and Insurance Receivable s \nThe Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities.

In 2018, the Company made payments for legal fees and settlements of $76 million related to the respirator\nmask/asbestos litigation. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $673\nmillion, up $65 million from the accrual at December 31, 2017.

This accrual represents the Company’s best estimate of Aearo’s probable loss and\nreflects an estimation period for future claims that may be filed against Aearo approaching the year 2050. Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for\nsettlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner\nLambert and their respective insurers (the “Payor Group”). Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold\nrespiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand and/or owned the AO Safety Division of American Optical Corporation and the alleged years of exposure\nof the individual plaintiff. Aearo’s share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between Aearo and Cabot on July 11,\n1995.

These\nactivities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. As the database of studies of both\nPFOA and PFOS has expanded, the EPA has developed human health effects documents summarizing the available data from these studies. In\n\nFebruary 2014, the EPA initiated external peer review of its draft human health effects documents for PFOA and PFOS. The peer review panel met in\nAugust 2014. In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the\nprovisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200 ppt for PFOS). Where PFOA and PFOS are found together, EPA\nrecommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PROA and PFOS combined is also 70 ppt. Lifetime health\nadvisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse\nhealth effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration. To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA.\npublished on May 2, 2012 a list of unregulated substances, including six PFAS, required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water\nsystem suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence. Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide.\nBased on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the level for PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July\n2016 EPA summary). A technical advisory issued by EPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65 public water\nsupplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and\ndo not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public\nwater supplies. EPA has announced a forthcoming management plan.\n\nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste\nassociated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the\nCompany entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the\npresence of PFAS in the soil at the Company’s manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately\ntwenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the\navailable options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former\nsludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues,\nand construction of the cap was substantially completed in 2018.\n\nThe Company continues to work with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007\nSettlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PFAS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington\nCounty, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the\nCompany’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii) providing treatment or\nalternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (“HBV”) or Health Risk Limit (“HRL”) (i.e., the amount of a\nchemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS\nfor which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii) remediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are\nnot controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain perfluorinated compounds. During\n2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and\nWoodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company’s Cottage Grove manufacturing facility.\nDuring the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M\ncommenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved\nby the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation\nwill continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2019.\n\nIn August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova,\nIllinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.\n\n114\n", "vlm_text": "persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the Company continues to review, control or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials or as byproducts in some of 3M's current flu oro chemical manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams. \nRegulatory activities concerning PFOA and/or PFOS continue in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies.

In May 2016, the EPA announced lifetime health advisory levels for PFOA and PFOS at 70 parts per trillion (ppt) (superseding the provisional levels established by the EPA in 2009 of 400 ppt for PFOA and 200pptfor PFOS).Where PFOA and PFOS are found together,EPA recommends that the concentrations be added together, and the lifetime health advisory for PFOA and PFOS combined is also  $70\\,\\mathrm{pm.}$  Lifetime health advisories, which are non-enforceable and non-regulatory, provide information about concentrations of drinking water contaminants at which adverse health effects are not expected to occur over the specified exposure duration.To collect exposure information under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the EPA published on May 2,2012 alist of unregulated substances,including sixPFAS,required to be monitored during the period 2013-2015 by public water system suppliers to determine the extent of their occurrence.Through January 2017, the EPA reported results for 4,920 public water supplies nationwide. Based on the 2016 lifetime health advisory, 13 public water supplies exceed the levelfor PFOA and 46 exceed the level for PFOS (unchanged from the July 2016 EPA summary).A technical advisory issued byEPA in September 2016 on laboratory analysis of drinking water samples stated that 65public water supplies had exceeded the combined level for PFOA and PFOS. These results are based on one or more samples collected during the period 2012-2015 and do not necessarily reflect current conditions of these public water supplies. EPA reporting does not identify the sources of the PFOA and PFOS in the public water supplies. EPA has announced a forthcoming management plan. \nThe Company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the Decatur, Alabama, Cottage Grove, Minnesota, and Cordova, Illinois plants. As previously reported, the Company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM) to address the presence of PFAS in the soil at the Company's manufacturing facility in Decatur, Alabama. Pursuant to a permit issued by ADEM, for approximately twenty years, the Company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing PFAS in fields at its Decatur facility. After a review of the available options to address the presence of PFAS in the soil, ADEM agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. Implementation of that plan continues, and construction of the cap was substantially completed in 2018. \nThe Company continues toworkwith the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA)pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address the presence of certain PF AS in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company's manufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota. Under this agreement, the Company's principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS from these sites and proposing response actions; (i) providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a Health Based Value (\\*\"HBV\") or Health Risk Limit (\"HRL\") (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) to be safe for human consumption over a lifetime) for certain PFAS for which a HBV and/or HRL exists as a result of contamination from these sites; (ii) re mediating identified sources of other PFAS at these sites that are not controlled by actions to remediate PFOA and PFOS; and (iv) sharing information with the MPCA about certain per flu or in a ted compounds. During 2008, the MPCA issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury). In August 2009, the MPCA issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the Company's Cottage Grove manufacturing facility. During the spring and summer of 2010, 3M began implementing the agreed upon remedial options at the Cottage Grove and Woodbury sites. 3M commenced the remedial option at the Oakdale site in late 2010. At each location the remedial options were recommended by the Company and approved by the MPCA. Remediation work has been completed at the Oakdale and Woodbury sites, and they are in an operational maintenance mode. Remediation will continue at the Cottage Grove site during 2019. \nIn August 2014, the Illinois EPA approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in Cordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results.

Under the terms of the settlement, 3M agreed to provide an  $\\S850$  million grant to the State for a special “3M Water Quality and Sustainability Fund.\" This Fund will enable projects that support water sustainability in the Twin Cities East Metro region, such as continued delivery of water to residents and enhancing groundwater recharge to support sustainable growth. The projects will also result in habitat and recreation improvements, such as fishing piers, trails, and open space preservation. 3Mrecorded a pre-taxcharge of  $\\S897$  million, inclusive of legal fees and other related obligations, in the first quarter of 2018 associated with the resolution of this matter. \nIn June 2018, the State of NewYork, by its Attorney General, filed a lawsuit in Albany Country Supreme Court against 3M, Tyco Fire Products LP Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Kidde-Fenwal, Inc., seeking to recover the costs incurred in responding to the contamination caused by Aqueous Film Forming Foam (AFFF) manufactured by 3M and others; damages for injury to, destruction of, and loss of the State's natural resources and related recreational series; and property damage. \nIn July 2018, the now former governor of Michigan requested that the now former Michigan Attorney General file a lawsuit against 3M and others related to PFAS in a public letter. The new Michigan Attorney General has not yet announced whether she will do so. \nIn December 2018,the State of Ohio,through its Attorney General,filed a lawsuit in the Common Pleas Court of Lucas County,Ohio against 3 M,Tyco Fire Products LP, Chemguard, Inc., Buckeye Fire Equipment Co., National Foam, Inc., and Angus Fire Armour Corp., seeking injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages for remediation costs and alleged injury to Ohio natural resources from A FFF manufacturers. \nAqueous Film Forming Foam(AFFF)Environmental Litigation \n3M manufactured and marketed AFFF for use in firefighting at airports and military bases from approximately 1963 to 2000.As of December 31, 2018, 85 putative class action and other lawsuits have been filed against 3M and other defendants in various state and federal courts in Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Massachusetts,New Jersey,NewYork, Ohio,Pennsylvania, and Washington "}
