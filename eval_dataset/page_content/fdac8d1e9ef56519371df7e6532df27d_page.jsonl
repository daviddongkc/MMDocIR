Towards realising this vision,  NARL gives equal emphasis to technology  development, observations, data archival,  dissemination, assimilation and modeling.  \nNARL carries out its research activities under  seven major groups, namely, Radar Application  and Development Group, I ono sph eric and  Space Research Group, Atmospheric Structure  and Dynamics Group, Cloud and Convective  Systems Group, Aerosols, Radiation and Trace  Gases Group, Weather and Climate Research  Group and Computers and Data Management  Group. Apart from these groups, there are  also specific projects such as the LIDAR  project and Advanced Space-borne Instrument  Development project.  \nThe image shows the MST Radar facility at the National Atmospheric Research Laboratory (NARL). The first part of the image displays a wide view of the radar facility, featuring a large array of antennas or poles, likely organized in a grid pattern, covering an extensive area. The arrangement suggests a complex setup used for atmospheric or meteorological research. The second part of the image provides a closer view of some of the antennas, highlighting their structural details and surrounding environment, such as cables and foundational support. The facility is likely used for scientific studies related to atmospheric conditions, weather prediction, or related fields.\nNorth Eastern-Space Applications Centre (NE-SAC) \nNE-SAC, located at Shillong, is a joint initiative of DOS and North Eastern Council (NEC) to provide  developmental support to the North Eastern Region (NER) using space science and technology. The  centre has the mandate to develop high technology infrastructure support to enable NE states to adopt  space technology inputs for their development.
