This specific type of scam is generally referred to as\nthe Nigerian scam because of its prevalence in that country. Such schemes typically involve\npromising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front\npayment, which the fraudster claims to require in order to cover the cost of documentation,\ntransfers, etc. Frequently, the sum is said to be lottery proceeds or personal/family funds being\nmoved out of a country by a victim of an oppressive government, although many types of\nscenarios have been used. This scheme is perpetrated globally through email, fax, or mail.\n\nAnti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT): Collective\nterm used to describe the overall legal, procedural, and enforcement regime countries must\nimplement to fight the threats of money laundering and terrorism financing.\n\nBearer Share: A bearer share is an equity security that is solely owned by whoever holds the\nphysical stock certificate. The company that issues the bearer shares does not register the owner\nof the stock nor does it track transfers of ownership. The company issues dividends to bearer\nshareholders when a physical coupon is presented.\n\nBlack Market Peso Exchange (BMPE): One of the most pernicious money laundering\nschemes in the Western Hemisphere. It is also one of the largest, processing billions of dollars’\nworth of drug proceeds a year from Colombia alone via trade-based money laundering (TBML,\ndefined below), “‘smurfing,” cash smuggling, and other schemes. BMPE-like methodologies are\nalso found outside the Western Hemisphere. There are variations on the schemes involved, but\ngenerally drug traffickers repatriate and exchange illicit profits obtained in the United States\nwithout moving funds across borders. In a simple BMPE scheme, a money launderer\ncollaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or Venezuela to provide him, at a discounted\nrate, U.S. dollars in the United States. These funds, usually drug proceeds, are used to purchase\nmerchandise in the United States for export to the merchant. In return, the merchant who\nimports the goods provides the money launderer with local-denominated funds (pesos) in\nColombia or Venezuela. The broker takes a cut and passes along the remainder to the\nresponsible drug cartel.\n\nBulk Cash Smuggling: Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals\naccumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity. Smuggling, in the context of bulk\ncash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one\ncountry to another.\n\nCross-border currency reporting: Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a\ncurrency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of\ncash and other negotiable monetary instruments.\n\nCounter-valuation: Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders. One of\nthe parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring\nvalue to another party and/or offsetting debt owed.\n", "vlm_text": "Definitions   \n419 Fraud Scheme:   An advanced fee fraud scheme, known as “419 fraud” in reference to the  fraud section in Nigeria’s criminal code.

This intergovernmental policy making body was given the mandate of examining money  laundering techniques and trends and setting international standards for combating money  laundering and terrorist financing.  \nFinancial Intelligence Unit (FIU):   In many countries, a central national agency responsible for  receiving, requesting, analyzing, and/or disseminating disclosures of financial information to the  competent authorities, primarily concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing  of terrorism.  An FIU’s mandate is backed up by national legislation or regulation.  The Financial  Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the U.S. financial intelligence unit.  \nFree Trade Zone (FTZ):   A special commercial and/or industrial area where foreign and  domestic merchandise may be brought in without being subject to the payment of usual  customs duties, taxes, and/or fees.  Merchandise, including raw materials, components, and  finished goods, may be stored, sold, exhibited, repacked, assembled, sorted, or otherwise  manipulated prior to re-export or entry into the area of the country covered by customs.  Duties  are imposed on the merchandise (or items manufactured from the merchandise) only when the  goods pass from the zone into an area of the country subject to customs.  FTZs may also be  called special economic zones, free ports, duty-free zones, or bonded warehouses.  \nFunnel Account:   An individual or business account in one geographic area that receives  multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, and from which the  funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between the deposits  and withdrawals.

However, because hawaladars have a history\nof and preference for opacity, a lack of technical capacity, and an unwillingness to implement\nCDD requirements (which they view as overly burdensome), they generally fail to file STRs.\nFinTRACA is working to expand supervision and implementation of the MSB/hawala licensing\nprogram.\n\nThe new asset recovery regulations cover only corruption cases. The Afghan government should\nexpand the regulations to include other crimes, such as money laundering and narcotics\ntrafficking.\n\nLack of supervision and regulation of precious metals and stones dealers, lawyers, accountants,\nand real estate agents remains a significant challenge.\n\nENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS\n\nRegulators and enforcement officers need adequate security and resources, political support, and\ncontinued training.\n\nAfghanistan’s Attorney General’s Office (AGO) and law enforcement authorities are hampered\nby limited resources, lack of technical expertise, poor coordination with counterpart agencies,\nlack of full independence, and poor infrastructure. Attorneys, judges, and law enforcement\nauthorities frequently lack the capacity to pursue and prosecute sophisticated or complex cases.\nLaw enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges continue to need training on effective, lawful\nasset seizure. Afghanistan should continue to improve seizure and confiscation procedures.\n\nCooperation between FinTRACA and the AGO is often limited by capacity hurdles and\ncorruption issues. Weak prosecutorial capacity to pursue money laundering cases and asset\nseizures is problematic. No entity has responsibility for post-conviction asset recovery or for the\nuse or equitable sharing of forfeited assets for crimes, other than assets forfeited in corruption\ncases.\n\nInsurance companies and securities dealers are required to file STRs, but the government does\nnot fully enforce this requirement.\n\nFinTRACA should establish a publicly available list of licensed hawalas and promote their use\nby the public. The DAB should continue to enhance its AML/CFT supervision and enforcement\ncapabilities.

However, because hawaladars have a history  of and preference for opacity, a lack of technical capacity, and an unwillingness to implement  CDD requirements (which they view as overly burdensome), they generally fail to file STRs.   FinTRACA is working to expand supervision and implementation of the MSB/hawala licensing  program.    \nThe new asset recovery regulations cover only corruption cases.  The Afghan government should  expand the regulations to include other crimes, such as money laundering and narcotics  trafficking.   \nLack of supervision and regulation of precious metals and stones dealers, lawyers, accountants,  and real estate agents remains a significant challenge.   \nENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  \nRegulators and enforcement officers need adequate security and resources, political support, and  continued training.    \nAfghanistan’s Attorney General’s Office (AGO) and law enforcement authorities are hampered  by limited resources, lack of technical expertise, poor coordination with counterpart agencies,  lack of full independence, and poor infrastructure.  Attorneys, judges, and law enforcement  authorities frequently lack the capacity to pursue and prosecute sophisticated or complex cases.   Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges continue to need training on effective, lawful  asset seizure.  Afghanistan should continue to improve seizure and confiscation procedures.    \nCooperation between FinTRACA and the AGO is often limited by capacity hurdles and  corruption issues.  Weak prosecutorial capacity to pursue money laundering cases and asset  seizures is problematic.  No entity has responsibility for post-conviction asset recovery or for the  use or equitable sharing of forfeited assets for crimes, other than assets forfeited in corruption  cases.   \nInsurance companies and securities dealers are required to file STRs, but the government does  not fully enforce this requirement.   \nFinTRACA should establish a publicly available list of licensed hawalas   and promote their use  by the public.  The DAB should continue to enhance its AML/CFT supervision and enforcement  capabilities.  Afghanistan should fully enforce market manipulation and counterfeiting as  predicates for money laundering and strengthen AML supervision of DNFBPs.  \nIn April 2020, DAB issued a report detailing the results of its onsite AML/CFT examinations of  57 MSBs and foreign-exchange dealers (FXD).  The report identifies a multitude of significant  deficiencies and concludes that, overall, MSB and FXD compliance with applicable laws and  regulations is weak.

Belgium’s Port of Antwerp is\nthe second busiest port in Europe, and with this large volume of legitimate trade inevitably\ncomes the trade in illicit goods. Antwerp is the primary entry point of cocaine into Europe from\nSouth American ports. In 2019, almost 62 tons of cocaine were seized at the Port of Antwerp\nand 41 tons were seized as of mid-year 2020.\n\nAccording to Belgium’s FIU, the Financial Information Processing Unit (CTIF), 11 percent of its\nreferrals to judicial authorities were drug-related in 2019, and five percent were related to\nterrorism and terrorist financing. CTIF estimates the total amount of illicit funds currently in\ncirculation is more than $3.5 billion.\n\nGiven that money laundering techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and criminals\nhave adapted their methods, CTIF introduced new analytical mechanisms in 2018 to improve the\nflow of information, foster cooperation with the federal prosecutors, and enhance partnerships\nand analysis of STRs. In 2019, the number of disclosures of suspicious transactions decreased\n22.2 percent in comparison to 2018. CTIF attributes the drop to improved reporting methods\nthat exclude those STRs that were ultimately deemed to be benign.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nBelgium is emerging as a primary European repository for bulk cash from drug proceeds.\nMultiple crime groups collect bulk cash in Belgium and move it to South American and Asian\nmarkets through various means. The opaque, closed nature of the Antwerp diamond industry\ninhibits money laundering investigations and provides a cover to launder illicit funds through\npre-existing, pseudo-legitimate networks.\n\nCriminal networks increasingly use virtual currencies such as bitcoin to facilitate illegal activity\nin Belgium. Fueled primarily by the sale of synthetic drugs via the dark web, virtual currency\nhas become the subject of a growing number of investigations by Belgian police. Platforms for\nexchanging virtual currencies and custodian wallet providers are not currently regulated in\nBelgium because of the lack of a legal depository.

Belgium’s Port of Antwerp is  the second busiest port in Europe, and with this large volume of legitimate trade inevitably  comes the trade in illicit goods.  Antwerp is the primary entry point of cocaine into Europe from  South American ports.  In 2019, almost 62 tons of cocaine were seized at the Port of Antwerp  and 41 tons were seized as of mid-year 2020.        \nAccording to Belgium’s FIU, the Financial Information Processing Unit (CTIF), 11 percent of its  referrals to judicial authorities were drug-related in 2019, and five percent were related to  terrorism and terrorist financing.  CTIF estimates the total amount of illicit funds currently in  circulation is more than  $\\S3.5$   billion.    \nGiven that money laundering techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and criminals  have adapted their methods, CTIF introduced new analytical mechanisms in 2018 to improve the  flow of information, foster cooperation with the federal prosecutors, and enhance partnerships  and analysis of STRs.  In 2019, the number of disclosures of suspicious transactions decreased  22.2 percent in comparison to 2018.  CTIF attributes the drop to improved reporting methods  that exclude those STRs that were ultimately deemed to be benign.     \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nBelgium is emerging as a primary European repository for bulk cash from drug proceeds.   Multiple crime groups collect bulk cash in Belgium and move it to South American and Asian  markets through various means.  The opaque, closed nature of the Antwerp diamond industry  inhibits money laundering investigations and provides a cover to launder illicit funds through  pre-existing, pseudo-legitimate networks.    \nCriminal networks increasingly use virtual currencies such as bitcoin to facilitate illegal activity  in Belgium.  Fueled primarily by the sale of synthetic drugs via the dark web, virtual currency  has become the subject of a growing number of investigations by Belgian police.  Platforms for  exchanging virtual currencies and custodian wallet providers are not currently regulated in  Belgium because of the lack of a legal depository.  Therefore, virtual currency transactions are  not subject to STR requirements.    \nGaming is legal in Belgium and is highly regulated, with the total number of licensed casinos  limited to nine.  Steady growth in internet gaming continues, but the extent of the activity is  currently unknown.

Criminal\nproceeds laundered in Bolivia are derived primarily from smuggling contraband and the drug\ntrade. In recent years, Bolivia has enacted several laws and regulations that, taken together,\nshould help the country more actively fight money laundering. Bolivia should continue its\nimplementation of its laws and regulations with the goal of identifying criminal activity that\nresults in investigations, criminal prosecutions, and convictions.\n\nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES\n\nMajor sources of illicit funds in Bolivia include cocaine trafficking, smuggled goods, corruption,\nillegal gold mining, and informal currency exchanges. Chile and Peru are the primary entry\npoints for illicit products, which are then sold domestically or informally exported.\n\nThe latest White House Office of National Drug Control Policy report found Bolivia had the\npotential to produce 301 metric tons of cocaine in 2019, a significant source of illicit profits.\nInformal gold mining also has grown in recent years. Although informal currency exchange\nbusinesses and non-registered currency exchanges are illegal, many still operate. Corruption is\ncommon in informal commercial markets and money laundering activity is likely.\n\nBolivia has 13 FTZs for commercial and industrial use in El Alto, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz,\nOruro, Puerto Aguirre, Desaguadero, and Cobija. Lack of regulatory oversight of these FTZs\nincreases money laundering vulnerabilities.\n\nA few legal casinos pay a hefty percentage to the government in order to run card games,\nroulette, slots, and bingo. Many illegal casinos operate in the informal market.\n\nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\nBolivia passed several laws to control the entry and exit of foreign exchange and criminalize\nillicit gains.

Criminal  proceeds laundered in Bolivia are derived primarily from smuggling contraband and the drug  trade.  In recent years, Bolivia has enacted several laws and regulations that, taken together,  should help the country more actively fight money laundering.  Bolivia should continue its  implementation of its laws and regulations with the goal of identifying criminal activity that  results in investigations, criminal prosecutions, and convictions.   \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nMajor sources of illicit funds in Bolivia include cocaine trafficking, smuggled goods, corruption,  illegal gold mining, and informal currency exchanges.  Chile and Peru are the primary entry  points for illicit products, which are then sold domestically or informally exported.   The latest White House Office of National Drug Control Policy report found Bolivia had the  potential to produce 301 metric tons of cocaine in 2019, a significant source of illicit profits.   Informal gold mining also has grown in recent years.  Although informal currency exchange  businesses and non-registered currency exchanges are illegal, many still operate.  Corruption is  common in informal commercial markets and money laundering activity is likely.   \nBolivia has 13 FTZs for commercial and industrial use in El Alto, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz,  Oruro, Puerto Aguirre, Desaguadero, and Cobija.  Lack of regulatory oversight of these FTZs  increases money laundering vulnerabilities.   \nA few legal casinos pay a hefty percentage to the government in order to run card games,  roulette, slots, and bingo.  Many illegal casinos operate in the informal market.   \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nBolivia passed several laws to control the entry and exit of foreign exchange and criminalize  illicit gains.  The National Council to Combat Illicit Laundering of Profits issues guidelines and  policies to combat money laundering.  Regulatory procedures allow for freezing and confiscation  of funds and other assets related to money laundering.   \nAll financial institutions in Bolivia are required by the Financial Investigative Unit (UIF),  Bolivia’s FIU, and banking regulations to report all transactions above  $\\S3{,}000$   (\\$10,000 for  banks).   \nBolivia has KYC regulations.  All transactions conducted through the financial system require  valid photo identification in addition to other required information.  Financial intermediaries  must enter this information into their systems, regardless of the transaction amount or whether  the transaction is a deposit or a withdrawal.  Private banks follow KYC international standards.   \nBolivia does not have a MLAT with the United States; however, various multilateral conventions  to which both countries are signatories are used for requesting mutual legal assistance.  U.S.  CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Bolivian National Customs signed  a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement in 2017 that expands cooperation and information  sharing, including in the area of money laundering, and provides for the sharing of forfeited  assets.  Under that agreement, in November 2020, Bolivia signed an MOU with ICE’s TTU to  exchange trade data for the purpose of better identifying TBML.  "}

Cooperation within and between Colombian AML agencies\ncontinues to be insufficient. Law enforcement agencies and prosecutors need more resources\nand specialized training to effectively investigate and prosecute complex financial crimes.\n\nMost goods brought into Colombia via TBML are sold in black-market venues, most frequently\nSan Andresitos, popular informal shopping areas and thus resistant to effective supervision and\nenforcement. Criminal organizations use adaptive financial networks, relying on corruption,\nbribery, and professional money launderers, to circumvent Colombia’s AML supervision and\nenforcement nets.\n\nThe Colombian Special Assets Entity, responsible for managing and disposing of forfeited\nassets, has struggled to manage its large inventory. Colombia has only 12 asset forfeiture judges\nand one asset forfeiture appellate court, so some asset forfeiture cases take up to 30 years to be\nresolved.\n\nPresident Duque’s administration has committed to improving and strengthening the country’s\nAML, CFT, and counter-proliferation structures through capacity-building initiatives and\nlegislative proposals.\n\nCosta Rica\nOVERVIEW\n\nOrganized crime and narcotics trafficking generate the majority of the financial crimes in Costa\nRica and present significant challenges for authorities. The country continues to show\nimprovement in its AML supervision framework.

While the\nconstruction, real estate, and hotel sectors are areas of concern, campaign financing is also a\nmoney laundering vulnerability.

Cooperation within and between Colombian AML agencies  continues to be insufficient.  Law enforcement agencies and prosecutors need more resources  and specialized training to effectively investigate and prosecute complex financial crimes.    \nMost goods brought into Colombia via TBML are sold in black-market venues, most frequently  San Andresitos, popular informal shopping areas and thus resistant to effective supervision and  enforcement.  Criminal organizations use adaptive financial networks, relying on corruption,  bribery, and professional money launderers, to circumvent Colombia’s AML supervision and  enforcement nets.    \nThe Colombian Special Assets Entity, responsible for managing and disposing of forfeited  assets, has struggled to manage its large inventory.  Colombia has only 12 asset forfeiture judges  and one asset forfeiture appellate court, so some asset forfeiture cases take up to 30 years to be  resolved.   \nPresident Duque’s administration has committed to improving and strengthening the country’s  AML, CFT, and counter-proliferation structures through capacity-building initiatives and  legislative proposals.  \nCosta Rica   \nOVERVIEW  \nOrganized crime and narcotics trafficking generate the majority of the financial crimes in Costa  Rica and present significant challenges for authorities.  The country continues to show  improvement in its AML supervision framework.  The country’s new state party status in the  OECD presents opportunities for progress.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nNarcotics trafficking continues to grow as a principal source of laundered assets in Costa Rica,  with cocaine seizures through October 2020 exceeding 40 metric tons--a new record.  While the  construction, real estate, and hotel sectors are areas of concern, campaign financing is also a  money laundering vulnerability.  Environmental crimes including illegal mining, wildlife  trafficking, and illegal logging also occur.  Authorities have identified sophisticated financing  and laundering schemes associated with these crimes and note that illicit revenue from  environmental crimes exceeds that of drug trafficking.  \nCosta Rica is not a regional financial hub; however, significant tourist and migrant flows  contribute to the vulnerability of Costa Rica’s airports and border crossings as sites for bulk cash  smuggling and related typologies.

Pursuant to the  local NORUT, the reporting entities file UTRs with the FIU.  The FIU analyzes the UTRs and  determines whether they should be classified as suspicious and disclosed to the law enforcement  and prosecutors.  Annually, the FIU receives approximately 50,000 UTRs and disseminates  roughly 900 to 5,000 to the authorities.  Because of the perceived growth in UTRs and in view of  limited resources, the FIU will launch a new reporting portal in January 2021 to automate  processes even more, as well as a new analysis system.    \nCuraçao recently conducted several high-profile money laundering investigations, and numerous  former officials were investigated, charged, or convicted.  There are two multi-year money  laundering prosecutions ongoing in Curaçao.  \nCyprus  \nOVERVIEW  \nThe Republic of Cyprus (ROC) is the only internationally recognized government on the island,  but, since 1974, the northern part of Cyprus has been administered by Turkish Cypriots.  The  north proclaimed itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) in 1983, but the  United States does not recognize the “TRNC,” nor does any country other than Turkey.  A buffer  zone patrolled by the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus separates the two sides.  The ROC and  the area administered by Turkish Cypriots are discussed separately below.  \nTHE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS  \nThe ROC continues to upgrade its established AML legal framework.  As a regional financial  and corporate services center, Cyprus has a significant number of nonresident businesses.   Although increased enforcement of registration rules caused the total number of companies to  decline from 272,157 in 2013 to 216,239 at the end of 2018, it rose to 223,282 at the end of  2019.  The long-term downward trend indicates an overall shrinkage of the international business  sector.  By law, all companies registered in the ROC must disclose their ultimate beneficial  owners to authorities.  \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nThe ROC financial system is vulnerable to money laundering by domestic and foreign criminals;  proceeds generated by illicit activity abroad pose a greater threat.  The primary sources of illicit  proceeds are investment fraud, corruption, advance fee fraud, tax evasion, illegal drugs, and  tobacco smuggling.  Additionally, cybercrime, especially phishing, e-mail hacking, and  ransomware use, continues to increase.  Criminals have reportedly used ROC banks to launder  proceeds, particularly from Russian and Ukrainian illicit activity.   "}

Money  laundering in Jamaica is primarily related to proceeds from illegal narcotics, weapons trafficking,  financial fraud schemes, corruption, and extortion.  The activities are largely perpetrated by  violent, organized criminal groups, some associated with powerful and influential Jamaicans.   Many of the financial crimes related to cybercrime and financial fraud schemes target U.S.  citizens.  There is also significant illicit trade of small arms and narcotics to and from Jamaica,  the United States, and Haiti, which generate large amounts of illicit wealth in Jamaica.     "}

The offshore sector is subject to supervisory  requirements similar to those of domestic institutions and to oversight by the Monetary Authority  of Macau.  Law No. 15/2018, which entered into force in December 2018, stipulates that from  January 2021 the offshore regime will be permanently terminated.  "}

The government has not\nyet provided the number of convictions for 2019. The money laundering unit of the organized\ncrime division of FGR informally reported it obtained 10 money laundering convictions in 2019,\ncompared to 6 convictions in 2018, according to open reporting. The file tracking system of\nMexico’s Federal Judiciary recorded six cases that resulted in guilty pleas and five that went to\ntrial in 2019. The data does not indicate whether the trials resulted in convictions. The relative\nlack of convictions in money laundering cases is representative of Mexico’s limited capacity to\nprosecute crimes generally.\n\nIn August 2019, the president signed into law non-conviction-based asset forfeiture legislation to\nenable prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to more aggressively seize illicit assets,\nincluding instrumentalities of crimes. The new law also adds corruption and money laundering\nas predicate offenses. Subsequently, FGR created a new specialized asset forfeiture unit to\npursue all federal forfeiture actions. In August 2020, the FGR filed its first three federal asset\nforfeiture complaints. The complaints were filed before Mexico’s lone federal asset forfeiture\njudge (there are pending plans to add more forfeiture judges) and have yet to be scheduled for an\ninitial hearing. There are additional asset forfeiture judges at the state level who are considering\ncases throughout the country, but no forfeiture matter has yet been resolved under the new law.\n\nMorocco\nOVERVIEW\n\nMorocco is making progress in strengthening its AML regime through coordination and capacity\nbuilding.

The government has not  yet provided the number of convictions for 2019.  The money laundering unit of the organized  crime division of FGR informally reported it obtained 10 money laundering convictions in 2019,  compared to 6 convictions in 2018, according to open reporting.  The file tracking system of  Mexico’s Federal Judiciary recorded six cases that resulted in guilty pleas and five that went to  trial in 2019.  The data does not indicate whether the trials resulted in convictions.  The relative  lack of convictions in money laundering cases is representative of Mexico’s limited capacity to  prosecute crimes generally.    \nIn August 2019, the president signed into law non-conviction-based asset forfeiture legislation to  enable prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to more aggressively seize illicit assets,  including instrumental i ties of crimes.  The new law also adds corruption and money laundering  as predicate offenses.  Subsequently, FGR created a new specialized asset forfeiture unit to  pursue all federal forfeiture actions.  In August 2020, the FGR filed its first three federal asset  forfeiture complaints.  The complaints were filed before Mexico’s lone federal asset forfeiture  judge (there are pending plans to add more forfeiture judges) and have yet to be scheduled for an  initial hearing.  There are additional asset forfeiture judges at the state level who are considering  cases throughout the country, but no forfeiture matter has yet been resolved under the new law.     \nMorocco   \nOVERVIEW  \nMorocco is making progress in strengthening its AML regime through coordination and capacity  building.  Vulnerabilities stem from the prevalence of cash-based transactions, geographic  location, established trafficking networks, a high volume of remittances, and public corruption.

Designated entities are\nrequired to file unusual transaction reports (UTRs) on transactions that could relate to money\nlaundering. The FIU-NL analyzes UTRs to determine whether they are “suspicious” and\nforwards them to law enforcement for criminal investigation, at which point they become\nclassified as STRs.

Drug  traffickers launder profits through illegal mining activities and gold transactions.    \nThe government implemented steps to strengthen its AML regime in 2020, including  establishing a special prosecutor’s office for asset forfeiture and gaining authorization from the  OECD to exchange international financial and tax information.

State presence is limited outside of coastal areas and large  population centers.  Peru’s challenging geography allows for the transit of large quantities of  illegal goods, contraband, and cash across its borders and internally.  Weak regulatory  enforcement allows illegal gold to be mixed with licit gold in the supply chain, as well as illegal  timber with licit timber.    \nIndividuals and organizations typically funnel illicit funds through front companies.

In May 2020, the Spanish National Police (SNP)  arrested 11 cybercriminals and was investigating five others for charges of money laundering,  fraud, and belonging to a criminal organization.  After dismantling this organization, the SNP  detected 150 bank accounts that had been used to defraud businesses across the United States,  Italy, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Lebanon, and China.  The organization used a  complex network of intermediaries and carveouts to hide the origin of money obtained by  criminal means (primarily phishing and social engineering) and to obscure the final recipients of  the funds.

The proceeds of illegal gaming, official corruption, underground lotteries, and  prostitution are laundered through the country’s informal financial channels.    \nVULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  \nFunds from various illegal industries are transported across Thailand’s four land borders and  through airports and seaports.  Money launderers and traffickers use banks, non-bank financial  institutions, and businesses to move the proceeds of criminal enterprises.  Unlicensed and  "}

Turkish law enforcement is cooperative with HSI, engages in  coordinated investigations, and proactively seeks assistance from the United States in these  matters.  \nTurkmenistan  \nOVERVIEW  \nTurkmenistan is not a regional financial center and is relatively isolated from the global financial  system.  Apart from the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, there are eight domestic banking  institutions.  Among the largest domestic banks are Dayhanbank, which services the agriculture  sector; Halk Bank, which manages private savings; Turkmenbashy Bank, which finances  industrial infrastructure; and the State Bank for Foreign Economic Relations, which services  major state- and privately-owned enterprises, including from the oil and gas sector.  Three  foreign commercial banks have operations in Turkmenistan:  Turkmen-Turkish Joint Stock  Commercial Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and Saderat Bank of Iran.  Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank also have representative offices in Turkmenistan and provide bank guarantees to  companies; they do not offer retail banking services.     \nThe country’s significant mineral and hydrocarbon exports are paid for through offshore  accounts with little public scrutiny or accounting.

Press reporting indicates hundreds of millions of dollars of  gold and other metals were stolen from Venezuelan reserves and shipped to third countries in an  attempt to skirt U.S. financial sanctions.  A robust black market continues to function in the  porous border regions with Colombia, and to some extent Brazil, via the smuggling of  commodities, including food staples and gas.    \nKEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  \nThe 2012  Organic Law Against Organized Crime and Financing of Terrorism , as revised in  2014, lacks important mechanisms to combat domestic criminal organizations, as it excludes the  state and its companies from the scope of investigations.  The Maduro regime used AML and  anticorruption laws as tools to suppress and intimidate political opposition, the private sector,  and NGOs – including those that provide humanitarian assistance.  Venezuela is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is  available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/member-countries/venezuela.   \nAML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  \nMaduro regime entities responsible for combating money laundering and corruption are  ineffective and lack political will.  Their technical capacity and willingness to address financial  crimes remain deeply inadequate.  Further, regime authorities are complicit in financial crime.  A  politicized judicial system further compromises the legal system’s effectiveness and impartiality.   \nVenezuela’s FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Unit (UNIF), is supervised by the  Superintendent of Banking Sector Institutions, which prevents UNIF from operating  independently.  FinCEN suspended information sharing with the UNIF in 2006 due to an  unauthorized disclosure of shared information.  The suspension remains in effect until FinCEN  has assurances its information will be protected.  The UNIF should operate autonomously,  independent of undue influence.    "}
