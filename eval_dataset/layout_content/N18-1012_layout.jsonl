We view this work as rigorously expanding on the foundation set by X U 12 ﬁve years earlier. It is our hope that with a common test set, the ﬁeld can ﬁnally benchmark approaches which do not require parallel data.

The formality and ﬂuency metrics corre- lated best and we believe that some combination of these metrics with others would be the best next step in the development of style transfer metrics. Such a metric could then in turn be used to opti- mize MT models. Finally, in this work we focused on one particular style, formality. The long term goal is to generalize the methods and metrics to any style.
