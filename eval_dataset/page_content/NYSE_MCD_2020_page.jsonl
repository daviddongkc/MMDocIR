In addition, to accelerate implementation of\ncertain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems.

Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.\n\nConstant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at\nprior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency\ntranslation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as income tax provision adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Act”), and bases incentive compensation plans on these results, because the Company believes this better\nrepresents underlying business trends.\n\nComparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the\nCompany or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants\nmay be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters (including restaurants\ntemporarily closed due to COVID-19 in 2020). Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any\nmarket considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period\nexceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by\nchanges in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.\n\nComparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees,\nin operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed.\n\nSystemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not\nrecorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial\nperformance, because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative\nof the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist solely of sales by Company-operated restaurants and\nfees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in\nSystemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\nThe Company’s after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes\nmeasures our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the\nmeasure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 12 for further information on the Company's\ncalculation of ROIC.\n\nFree cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free\ncash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company's ability to convert net\nprofits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder\nvalue. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 12 for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash\nflow conversion rate.\n\n2020 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\n\nIn 2020, global comparable sales decreased 7.7% primarily as a result of COVID-19. Comparable guest counts were negative across all\nsegments for the year.\n\nComparable sales in the U.S. increased 0.4% benefiting from strong average check growth and positive comparable sales primarily at\nthe dinner daypart. The Company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activity, along with growth in delivery, had a\npositive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020.\n\nComparable sales in the International Operated segment decreased 15.0% reflecting negative comparable sales in most markets as a\nresult of COVID-19. The comparable sales decline was primarily driven by France, the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain, partly offset by\npositive results in Australia.\n\nComparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment decreased 10.5% reflecting negative comparable sales\nprimarily in Latin America and Asia, partly offset by strong comparable sales in Japan.\n\nIn addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results in 2020:\n\nConsolidated revenues decreased 10% (10% in constant currencies).\nSystemwide sales decreased 7% (7% in constant currencies).\n\nConsolidated operating income decreased 19% (20% in constant currencies) and included $268 million of net strategic gains.\nExcluding these gains, operating income decreased 23% (23% in constant currencies), when also excluding $74 million of net strategic\ncharges from the prior year.

Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any  market considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period  exceeds   $100\\%$  ), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by  changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. \n\n \n• Comparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees,  in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed.\n\n \n• Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not  recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial  performance, because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative  of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist solely of sales by Company-operated restaurants and  fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in  Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.\n\n \n• The Company’s after-tax return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes  measures our capital-allocation effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the  measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 12 for further information on the Company's  calculation of ROIC.\n\n \n• Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free  cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net  profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder  value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 12 for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash  flow conversion rate. \n2020 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE \nIn 2020, global comparable sales decreased  $7.7\\%$   primarily as a result of COVID-19. Comparable guest counts were negative across all  segments for the year. \nthe dinner daypart. The Company's strategic marketing investments and promotional activity, along with growth in delivery, had a  positive impact on comparable sales in the second half of 2020.\n\n • Comparable sales in the International Operated segment decreased  $15.0\\%$   reflecting negative comparable sales in most markets as a  result of COVID-19. The comparable sales decline was primarily driven by France, the U.K., Germany, Italy and Spain, partly offset by  positive results in Australia.\n\n \n• Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment decreased  $10.5\\%$   reflecting negative comparable sales   primarily in Latin America and Asia, partly offset by strong comparable sales in Japan. \nIn addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results in 2020:\n\n \n• Consolidated revenues decreased   $10\\%$   (  $10\\%$   in constant currencies).\n\n \n• Systemwide sales decreased  $7\\%$   (  $7\\%$   in constant currencies).\n\n \n• Consolidated operating income decreased   $19\\%$   (  $20\\%$   in constant currencies) and included  $\\S268$   million of net strategic gains.

Additionally, we provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald’s  System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to the  Company or reputational harm. \nDespite the implementation of security measures, those technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or  failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become  vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our increasing  reliance on third party systems also present the risks faced by the third party’s business, including the operational, security and credit risks  of those parties. If those systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not  effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees’ operations.

The Company has determined that it\nis the principal in these arrangements. Accordingly, the related revenue is presented on a gross basis on the Consolidated Statement of\nIncome.

This was elected for the Company’s entire lessee and lessor portfolio\nfor any rent deferrals or rent abatements. For the lessee portfolio, the Company elected not to remeasure the Lease right- of-use asset and\nLease liability if a rent deferral or a rent abatement is granted. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnotes on page 52 of this Form 10-K\nfor additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability.\n\nThe Company deferred collection of approximately $490 million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has\ncollected over 80% of these deferrals as of December 31, 2020. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent\npayments based on a percent of sales.\n\nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental\nincome as well as royalties.\n\nCAPITALIZED SOFTWARE\n\nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which\nprimarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate\nsystems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2020-$691.2; 2019-$665.4; 2018-$609.7.\n\nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\namount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as\nwhen new software may be ready for its intended use. Results for the year ended 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software that were no\nlonger being used of $26.3 million.\n\nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\n\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that\nthe carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald’s restaurant assets for potential\nimpairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company\nmanages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant's\ncash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of\nassets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its\ncarrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the\nrestaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows.\n\nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and\ncommitted to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12\nmonths, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related\nto restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered “held for sale\".\n\nGOODWILL\n\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other\nbusinesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases\nin subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the\nsynergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the\nacquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is\nbased on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit.\n\nThe following table presents the 2020 activity in goodwill by segment:\n\nInternational Developmental\n\nInternational Licensed Markets &\n\na millions essetneestennennteee essetnnensetnneennee operated Markets aumes Compo ate cane orsolidated,\nBalance at December 31, 2019 $1,615.8 $ 1,061.6 $ _— $2,677.4\nBusiness acquisitions 9.8 _ _ 9.8\nNet restaurant purchases (sales) (0.1) 9.8 _ 9.7\nImpairment losses _ — _ _\nCurrency translation _ 76.2 _ 76.2\n\nBalance at December 31, 2020 $1,625.5 $ 1,147.6 $ _ $2,773.1\n\nThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exists. If an\nindicator of impairment exists, the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future\ncash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is\nrecorded for the difference. In the current period, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of\nimpairment. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of $14.5 million and $113.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2020 Annual Report 45\n", "vlm_text": "The Company elected the practical expedient to account for COVID-19 related rent concessions as if they were part of the enforceable  rights and obligations of the parties under the existing lease contract.

Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnotes on page 52 of this Form 10-K  for additional information on the Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability. \nThe Company deferred collection of approximately  $\\S490$   million of rental income on revenue that was recognized in 2020, and has  collected over  $80\\%$   of these deferrals as of December 31, 2020. Rental income includes both minimum rent payments and variable rent  payments based on a percent of sales. \nRefer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on deferred collections of rental  income as well as royalties. \nCAPITALIZED SOFTWARE \nCapitalized software is stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the software, which  primarily ranges from 2 to 7 years. Customer facing software is typically amortized over a shorter useful life, while back office and Corporate  systems may have a longer useful life. Capitalized software less accumulated amortization is recorded within Miscellaneous other assets on  the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was (in millions): 2020-\\$691.2; 2019-\\$665.4; 2018-\\$609.7. \nThe Company reviews capitalized software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying  amount of an asset may not be recoverable or if an indicator of impairment exists, which occurs more regularly throughout the year, such as  when new software may be ready for its intended use. Results for the year ended 2020 reflected write-offs of impaired software that were no  longer being used of  $\\S26.3$   million. \nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that  the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. For purposes of annually reviewing McDonald’s restaurant assets for potential  impairment, assets are initially grouped together in the U.S. at a field office level, and internationally, at a market level. The Company  manages its restaurants as a group or portfolio with significant common costs and promotional activities; as such, an individual restaurant’s  cash flows are not generally independent of the cash flows of others in a market. If an indicator of impairment exists for any grouping of  assets, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by each individual restaurant within the asset grouping is compared to its  carrying value. If an individual restaurant is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the  restaurant over its fair value as determined by an estimate of discounted future cash flows. \nLosses on assets held for disposal are recognized when management and the Board of Directors, as required, have approved and  committed to a plan to dispose of the assets, the assets are available for disposal and the disposal is probable of occurring within 12  months, and the net sales proceeds are expected to be less than its net book value, among other factors. Generally, such losses are related  to restaurants that have closed and ceased operations as well as other assets that meet the criteria to be considered “held for sale\". \nGOODWILL \nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets of acquired restaurants and other  businesses. The Company's goodwill primarily results from purchases of McDonald's restaurants from franchisees and ownership increases  in subsidiaries or affiliates, and it is generally assigned to the reporting unit (defined as each individual market) expected to benefit from the  synergies of the combination. If a Company-operated restaurant is sold within 24 months of acquisition, the goodwill associated with the  acquisition is written off in its entirety. If a restaurant is sold beyond 24 months from the acquisition, the amount of goodwill written off is  based on the relative fair value of the business sold compared to the reporting unit. \nThe table shows financial data in millions for different segments: U.S., International Operated Markets, International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate, and Consolidated. It compares balances at the end of 2019 and 2020, along with adjustments from business acquisitions, net restaurant purchases (sales), impairment losses, and currency translation.\n\n- For the U.S.:\n  - 2019 Balance: $1,615.8\n  - Adjustments: Business acquisitions ($9.8), Net restaurant sales (-$0.1)\n  - 2020 Balance: $1,625.5\n\n- For International Operated Markets:\n  - 2019 Balance: $1,061.6\n  - Adjustments: Net restaurant purchases ($9.8), Currency translation ($76.2)\n  - 2020 Balance: $1,147.6\n\n- For International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate, there are no figures provided.\n\n- Consolidated:\n  - 2019 Balance: $2,677.4\n  - Adjustments: Business acquisitions ($9.8), Net restaurant sales ($9.7), Currency translation ($76.2)\n  - 2020 Balance: $2,773.1\nThe Company conducts goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever indicators of impairment exists. If an  indicator of impairment exists, the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit, generally based on discounted future  cash flows, with its carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is  recorded for the difference. In the current period, the Company performed a qualitative assessment and did not identify any indicators of  impairment. Historically, goodwill impairment has not significantly impacted the consolidated financial statements. Goodwill on the  Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects accumulated impairment losses of  $\\S14.5$   million and  $\\S113.9$   million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,  respectively. "}

The Company may also use certain derivatives to mitigate the share\nprice risk related to its sale of stock in McDonald’s Japan. The changes in the fair value of the undesignated derivatives used for the most\nrecent sale transaction were recognized immediately in earnings in Other operating (income) expense, net. In addition, the Company uses\nforeign currency forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The changes in\nthe fair value of these derivatives are recognized in Nonoperating (income) expense, net, along with the currency gain or loss from the\nhedged balance sheet position.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company did not\nhave significant exposure to any individual counterparty at December 31, 2020 and has master agreements that contain netting\narrangements. For financial reporting purposes, the Company presents gross derivative balances in the financial statements and\nsupplementary data, including for counterparties subject to netting arrangements. Some of these agreements also require each party to post\ncollateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2020, the Company was\nrequired to post an immaterial amount of collateral due to the negative fair value of certain derivative positions. The Company's\ncounterparties were not required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on certain hedges of the Company’s supplemental\nbenefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.\n\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\n\nThe Company has a share-based compensation plan, which authorizes the granting of various equity-based incentives including stock\noptions and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) to employees and nonemployee directors.\n\nShare-based compensation, which includes the portion vesting of all share-based awards granted based on the grant date fair value, is\ngenerally amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period in Selling, general & administrative expenses.\n\nThe fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form pricing model. The pricing model\nrequires assumptions, which impact the assumed fair value, including the expected life of the stock option, the risk-free interest rate,\nexpected volatility of the Company's stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield. The Company uses historical data to\ndetermine these assumptions and if these assumptions change significantly for future grants, share-based compensation expense will\nfluctuate in future years. In addition, the Company estimates forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to be\nrecognized each period.\n\nThe fair value of each RSU granted is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at date of grant. For performance-based RSUs,\nthe Company includes a relative Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") modifier to determine the number of shares earned at the end of the\nperformance period. The fair value of performance-based RSUs that include the TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation\nmodel.\n\nRefer to the Share-based Compensation footnote on page 58 for additional information.\n\nPER COMMON SHARE INFORMATION\n\nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using net income divided by diluted weighted-average shares. Diluted weighted-average\nshares include weighted-average shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of share-based compensation calculated using the treasury\nstock method, of (in millions of shares): 2020-5.5; 2019-6.8; 2018-7.3. Share-based compensation awards that were not included in diluted\nweighted-average shares because they would have been antidilutive were (in millions of shares): 2020—1.8; 2019-0.1; 2018-0.5.\n\nCASH AND EQUIVALENTS\n\nThe Company considers short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, Cash and equivalents was $3.4 billion, of which $2.0 billion consisted of certificates of deposit.\n\nMcDonald's Corporation 2020 Annual Report 49\n", "vlm_text": "Net Investment Hedges \nThe Company primarily uses foreign currency denominated debt (third party and intercompany) to hedge its investments in certain foreign  subsidiaries and affiliates. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in shareholders' equity in the  foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") and offset translation adjustments on the underlying net  assets of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, which also are recorded in OCI. As of December 31, 2020,  $\\Updownarrow13.3$   billion of the Company's third  party foreign currency denominated debt and  $\\S843.2$   million of intercompany foreign currency denominated debt were designated to hedge  investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. \nUndesignated Derivatives \nThe Company enters into certain derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting, therefore the changes in the fair value of these  derivatives are recognized immediately in earnings together with the gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position.

{"page": 56, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_MCD_2020_56.jpg", "ocr_text": "Leasing Arrangements\n\nThe Company is the lessee in a significant real estate portfolio, primarily through ground leases (the Company leases the land and generally\nowns the building) and through improved leases (the Company leases the land and buildings). The Company determines whether an\narrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in\nmany cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Renewal options are typically solely at the Company's discretion. Escalation\nterms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-value market\nadjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years.\n\nThe following table provides detail of rent expense:\n\nIn millions 2020 2019 2018\neer eeseeetneeetneeetneeeee eeseeetneeeeneeeeneeeee eeseeetseeeeneeeeneeee re oT aren oy ar eer ere\nOther 79.8 76.4 87.9\n\nTotal rent expense $1,521\n\nRent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows-Company-operated restaurants: 2020-$53.7;\n2019-$74.4; 2018-$82.1. Franchised restaurants: 2020-$136.5; 2019-$200.7; 2018-$200.8. These variable rent payments are based on a\npercent of sales and as sales have decreased in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, the related rent expense has also decreased as compared\nto the prior year.\n\nThe Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments\nover the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental\nborrowing rate.

The Company determines whether an  arrangement is a lease at inception. Lease terms for most restaurants, where market conditions allow, are generally for 20 years and, in  many cases, provide for rent escalations and renewal options. Renewal options are typically solely at the Company’s discretion. Escalation  terms vary by market with examples including fixed-rent escalations, escalations based on an inflation index and fair-value market  adjustments. The timing of these escalations generally range from annually to every five years. \nThe table presents rent expenses in millions for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018. It is divided into two categories: Restaurants and Other. Here's the data breakdown:\n\n- For Restaurants:\n  - In 2020, the rent expense was $1,399.5 million.\n  - In 2019, the rent expense was $1,530.4 million.\n  - In 2018, the rent expense was $1,433.9 million.\n\n- For Other:\n  - In 2020, the rent expense was $79.8 million.\n  - In 2019, the rent expense was $76.4 million.\n  - In 2018, the rent expense was $87.9 million.\n\n- The Total rent expense is given as:\n  - $1,479.3 million in 2020.\n  - $1,606.8 million in 2019.\n  - $1,521.8 million in 2018.\nRent expense included percent rents in excess of minimum rents (in millions) as follows–Company-operated restaurants:  $2020–{\\Updownarrow}53.7$  ;   $2019{-}\\S74.4$  ;   $2018–\\Uparrow82.1$  . Franchised restaurants:  $2020–\\S136.5$  ;   $2019{-}\\S200.7$  ;   $2018–\\S200.8$  . These variable rent payments are based on a  percent of sales and as sales have decreased in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, the related rent expense has also decreased as compared  to the prior year. \nThe Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability reflect the present value of the Company's estimated future minimum lease payments  over the lease term, which includes options that are reasonably assured of being exercised, discounted using a collateralized incremental  borrowing rate. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset lives of the building  or leasehold improvements exceed that of the initial lease term, and the sales performance of the restaurant remains strong. Therefore, the  Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company,  and are not currently a future obligation.  \nThe Company's lease portfolio includes both operating and finance leases, however as of December 31, 2020, the vast majority of the  portfolio was classified as operating leases. \nAs the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease  liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease  within a particular currency environment.

In December\n2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and, during 2019 and 2020, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have\na dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters. As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not yet have a signed\nagreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues.\n\nIn 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company's U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS\nissued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR.

The transfer pricing matters for 2011\nand 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process. The\nCompany is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under\naudit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that\nthe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to $1,040 million within the next 12 months. This would be due to the\npossible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of\nthe statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions.\n\nIn addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12\nmonths, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded.

It breaks down various adjustments to a balance over the year, including:\n\n- **Balance at January 1**: $1,439.1 million in 2020 and $1,342.8 million in 2019.\n- **Decreases for positions taken in prior years**: $(71.4) million in 2020 and $(18.3) million in 2019.\n- **Increases for positions taken in prior years**: $38.5 million in 2020 and $107.1 million in 2019.\n- **Increases for positions related to the current year**: $89.6 million in 2020 and $88.3 million in 2019.\n- **Settlements with taxing authorities**: $(3.9) million in 2020 and $(68.6) million in 2019.\n- **Lapsing of statutes of limitations**: $(12.7) million in 2020 and $(12.2) million in 2019.\n- **Balance at December 31**: $1,479.2 million in 2020 and $1,439.1 million in 2019.\n In 2015, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) that included certain disagreed transfer pricing  adjustments related to the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2009 and 2010. Also in 2015, the Company filed a protest with  the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. During 2017, the Company received a response to its protest. In December  2018, the Company met with the IRS Appeals team and, during 2019 and 2020, the Company and the IRS Appeals team continued to have  a dialogue regarding these disagreed transfer pricing matters.  As of December 31, 2020, the Company does not yet have a signed  agreement with the IRS related to the settlement of these issues. \nIn 2017, the IRS completed its examination of the Company’s U.S. Federal income tax returns for 2011 and 2012. In 2018, the IRS  issued a RAR for these years. As expected, the RAR included the same disagreed transfer pricing matters as the 2009 and 2010 RAR. Also  in 2018, the Company filed a protest with the IRS related to these disagreed transfer pricing matters. The transfer pricing matters for 2011  and 2012 are being addressed along with the 2009 and 2010 transfer pricing matters as part of the 2009-2010 appeals process. The  Company is also under audit in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions for matters primarily related to transfer pricing, and the Company is under  audit in multiple state tax jurisdictions. While the Company cannot estimate the impact to the effective tax rate, it is reasonably possible that  the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease up to  $^{\\S1,040}$   million within the next 12 months. This would be due to the  possible settlement of the IRS transfer pricing matters, completion of the aforementioned foreign and state tax audits and the expiration of  the statute of limitations in multiple tax jurisdictions. \nIn addition, it is reasonably possible that, as a result of audit progression in both the U.S. and foreign tax audits within the next 12  months, there may be new information that causes the Company to reassess the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits recorded. While  the Company cannot estimate the impact that new information may have on our unrecognized tax benefit balance, it believes that the  liabilities recorded are appropriate and adequate. \nThe Company operates within multiple tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions.  With few exceptions, the Company  is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2009.  \nThe Company had  $\\S177.4$   million and  $\\S174.4$   million accrued for interest and penalties related to tax matters at December 31, 2020 and  2019, respectively.

The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement  comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this  Agreement shall be interpreted to be in compliance with Section 409A.  Any payments that qualify for the  “short-term deferral” exception, the separation pay exception or another exception under Section 409A shall be  paid under the applicable exception.

{"page": 88, "image_path": "page_images/NYSE_MCD_2020_88.jpg", "ocr_text": "Reconciliation of Returns on Incremental Invested Capital\n\nROIIC is a measure that evaluates the overall profitability of our markets and the effectiveness of capital deployed over one-year and three-\nyear time periods. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign\ncurrency translation. The numerator is the Company's incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base\nperiod.\n\nThe denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The\nweighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to\nreflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income.

This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign  currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base  period. \nThe denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The  weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis.
