Diabetes sales  were driven by sales of GLP-1 products (Victoza ® ,  Ozempic ®  and Rybelsus ® ), which offset mixed  market conditions for insulins. We continued to  help more people living with obesity, while making  \nprogress with our ambition to secure sustained  growth within our Biopharm division thanks to  strong demand for our growth hormone and new  haemophilia products. \nI believe that our ability to meet the needs of our  millions of patients during the pandemic in 2020  comes as a consequence of our crystal-clear  purpose and long-established company values. We  are far from done and have many more millions  of patients for whom treatment is not accessible  today. So now is the time to continue to invest in  our people and in our organisation, creating an  inclusive, diverse and safe working environment  in which colleagues have equal opportunities to  thrive and fulfil their potential. \nLooking to the future, I am confident that our clear  corporate strategy will make us a valued partner to  society as the world continues on the long road to  recovery from the pandemic. \nIn closing, I would like to thank my colleagues  around the world for their agility and commitment  during this most challenging of years. Special thanks  must go to our partners and collaborators, without  whom we could not succeed. A sincere thank you  goes to our Board of Directors for their continued  support and constructive challenging of the organ- isation. Finally, I would like to send a thank you to  our shareholders for their continuous support. \nLars Fruergaard Jørgensen President & Chief Executive Officer "}

Programme expanded  during COVID-19 \n–  Human insulin: For about 25 USD per vial at  national pharmacies, including Walmart and CVS\n\n –  Immediate Supply Program: A free, one-time,  immediate supply of Novo Nordisk insulin (up to  3 vials or 2 packs of pens) to eligible patients at  risk of rationing\n\n \n–  Co-pay Savings Cards: To help defray high  out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured  patients. \nDuring 2020, we reached more than one million  people through affordability offerings in the US. \nWe also recognise that there are vulnerable  patients in every country and to identify these  groups we will initiate vulnerability assessments  where we operate, excluding the US where we  have already expanded our affordability offerings.  We do this to identify how we can improve access  to affordable care and capacity building. Based on  21 country assessments made in 2020, we have  developed affordability plans in 19 countries. \nVulnerable patient groups include people impact- ed by humanitarian crises, people living in remote  areas or in poorer parts of the world with ineffi- cient healthcare systems and vulnerable popula- tion groups, such as children and the elderly. \nIn 2020, we strengthened our Access to Insulin  Commitment by lowering the ceiling price (the  maximum price within the commitment) from USD  4 to USD 3 per human insulin vial in 76 countries.  This covers Least Developed Countries as defined  by the UN, other low-income countries as defined  by the World Bank, and middle-income countries in  which large low-income populations lack sufficient  health coverage, as well as selected humanitarian  organisations.

The guidance reflects expectations\n\nor continued sales growth in International\nOperations in line with the Strategic Aspiration of\n6-10% growth as well as growth in North America\nOperations. The guidance reflects expectations\nor sales growth within Diabetes care, mainly\ndriven by the GLP-1 products Ozempic® and\nRybelsus®, as well as growth within Obesity care.\nntensifying competition within both Diabetes care\nand Biopharm is also reflected in the guidance.\nFurthermore, continued pricing pressure within\n\nDiabetes care, especially in the US, is expected to\nnegatively impact sales development. Given the\ncurrent exchange rates versus the Danish krone,\ngrowth reported in DKK is expected to be around 4\npercentage points lower than at CER.\n\nOperating profit growth is expected to be 4% to\n8% at CER. The expectation for operating profit\ngrowth primarily reflects the sales growth out-\nlook and continued investments in current and\nfuture growth drivers across the operating units,\nincluding the continued roll-out of Ozempic® and\nRybelsus® as well as global investments in building\nan anti-obesity market and the expected launch\nof semaglutide 2.4 mg in the US. Furthermore, re-\nsources are allocated to both early and late-stage\npipeline activities, including expected initiations\nof several phase 3a clinical trial programmes in\n\n2021. Given the current exchange rates versus\n\nthe Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now\nexpected to be around 6 percentage points lower\nthan at CER, mainly driven by the spot rate of the\nUSD being 615 versus an average of 654 in 2020.\n\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic causes\nuncertainty to the outlook regarding the number\nof patients initiating treatment and societal\nimpacts such as the unemployment rate in the\nUS, which is impacting healthcare insurance\ncoverage. The outlook is based on a number of\nassumptions related to the severity and duration\nof impacts from COVID-19.

The guidance reflects expectations  for continued sales growth in International  Operations in line with the Strategic Aspiration of   $6{\\sim}10\\%$   growth as well as growth in North America  Operations. The guidance reflects expectations  for sales growth within Diabetes care, mainly  driven by the GLP-1 products Ozempic ®  and  Rybelsus ® , as well as growth within Obesity care.  Intensifying competition within both Diabetes care  and Biopharm is also reflected in the guidance.  Furthermore, continued pricing pressure within  Diabetes care, especially in the US, is expected to  negatively impact sales development. Given the  current exchange rates versus the Danish krone,  growth reported in DKK is expected to be around 4  percentage points lower than at CER.  \nOperating profit growth is expected to be  $4\\%$   to   $8\\%$   at CER. The expectation for operating profit  growth primarily reflects the sales growth out- look and continued investments in current and  future growth drivers across the operating units,  including the continued roll-out of Ozempic ®  and  Rybelsus ®  as well as global investments in building  an anti-obesity market and the expected launch  of semaglutide  $2.4\\,\\mathsf{m g}$   in the US. Furthermore, re- sources are allocated to both early and late-stage  pipeline activities, including expected initiations  of several phase 3a clinical trial programmes in  \n2021. Given the current exchange rates versus  the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now  expected to be around 6 percentage points lower  than at CER, mainly driven by the spot rate of the  USD being 615 versus an average of 654 in 2020.  \nThe current COVID-19 pandemic causes  uncertainty to the outlook regarding the number  of patients initiating treatment and societal  impacts such as the unemployment rate in the  US, which is impacting healthcare insurance  coverage. The outlook is based on a number of  assumptions related to the severity and duration  of impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, volatility  in quarterly results should be expected.  \nFor 2021, Novo Nordisk expects financial items  (net) to amount to a gain of around DKK 0.7 billion,  reflecting the expected hedging gains of DKK  1.1 billion mainly related to the US dollar with  a hedging period of 11 months and associated  hedging costs. \nThe effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in  the range of  $20–22\\%$  .  \nCapital expenditure is expected to be around   $\\mathsf{D K K}\\,8.0$   billion in 2021, primarily relating to  investments in additional capacity for active  pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production at  existing manufacturing sites within Diabetes care.  The expected increase in capital expenditure  reflects progress of R&D projects based on the  oral technology platform.  \nDepreciation, amortisation and impairment  losses are expected to be around  $\\mathsf{D K K\\,6.0}$   billion.  The increase in depreciation, amortisation and  impairment losses in 2021 reflects depreciation  of the new production facility for diabetes active  pharmaceutical ingredients in Clayton, North  Carolina, US. The free cash flow is expected to be  DKK 36-41 billion. The increase in free cash flow  compared to 2020 reflects the impact from the  acquisitions in 2020.  \nAll of the above expectations are based on as- sumptions that the global or regional macroeco- nomic and political environment will not significant- ly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk  during 2021, including the potential implications  from major healthcare reforms, and that the cur- rency exchange rates, especially the US dollar, will  \nOutlook 2021 \nThe current expectations for 2021 are summarised in the table below: \nThe table outlines financial expectations as of February 3, 2021, in various categories:\n\n1. **Sales Growth:**\n   - At CER (Constant Exchange Rates): 5% to 9%.\n   - As reported: Around 4 percentage points lower than at CER.\n\n2. **Operating Profit Growth:**\n   - At CER: 4% to 8%.\n   - As reported: Around 6 percentage points lower than at CER.\n\n3. **Financial Items (Net):** Gain of around DKK 0.7 billion.\n\n4. **Effective Tax Rate:** Expected to be 20% to 22%.\n\n5. **Capital Expenditure (PP&E):** Expected to be around DKK 8.0 billion.\n\n6. **Depreciation, Amortisation and Impairment Losses:** Around DKK 6 billion.\n\n7. **Free Cash Flow:** Expected to be between DKK 36-41 billion."}

By 2020, it was the aim that at least  two members were of Nordic nationality and two  of non-Nordic nationality. The aim was also to  have at least three shareholder-elected Board  members of each gender. \nThe Nomination Committee presents proposals  for election or re-election of shareholder-elected  Board members to the Board of Directors. When  recommending candidates to be nominated by  the Board, the Nomination Committee considers  factors such as the balance between renewal  and continuity, the desired competences and  experience, the performance of the individual  Board members, the ambition for diversity as well  as independence considerations. \nAs of 31 December 2020, our shareholder- elected Board members consisted of two Nordic  members and seven non-Nordic members. Of  these, three members were female and six were  male. Thus, the Board of Directors fulfilled its  2016 gender and nationality ambition. The Board  of Directors finds that being diverse in gender  and nationality is of continued importance, and  consequently in 2020 the Board of Directors  prolonged its gender and nationality ambition  to 2024. When including the employee-elected  Board members, six members were Nordic and  seven were non-Nordic. Of these, five were  female and eight were male. \nThe Board of Directors has determined a  competence profile for the shareholder-elected  Board members. Board members should possess  integrity, accountability, fairness, financial  literacy, commitment and desire for innovation.  Additionally, the following competences and  experience should be represented: Global  business management, strategic operations and  governance. Healthcare industry and market  access. Research and development, technology  and digitalisation. M&A and external innovation  sourcing. People leadership and change  management. Finance and accounting. \nIn accordance with sections 99b and 107d of the  Danish Financial Statements Act, Novo Nordisk  discloses current performance on diversity in  the social responsibility section.

(2,797) 610 1,016\nAt the end of the year 34,052 30,878 25,760\n\nSales discounts and sales rebates are predominantly issued in the US. As\nsuch, rebates amount to 74% of gross sales in the US (71% in 2019 and 68%\nin 2018). Provisions for sales rebates includes US Managed Care, Medicare,\nMedicaid and other minor US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of\nEuropean countries and Canada.\n\nPricing mechanisms in the US market\n\nIn the US, sales rebates are paid in connection with public healthcare\ninsurance programmes, namely Medicare and Medicaid, as well as rebates\nto pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare plans.\nKey customers in the US include private payers, PBMs and government\npayers. PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating\nprice concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and\ngovernment channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their\nformularies (or ‘preferred drug lists’).\n\nUS Managed Care and Medicare\n\nFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of\n\nPBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the\ncustomer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters\nrelating to formulary status or pre-established market shares thresholds.\nRebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement,\nhistorical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market\nshare information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to\n\nreflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are\ngenerally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.\n\nUS wholesaler charge-backs\n\nWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo\nNordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at\ncontract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. A\nwholesaler charge-back represents the difference between the invoice price\nto the wholesaler and the indirect customer's contract price. Accruals are\ncalculated for estimated charge-backs using a combination of factors such\nas historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms\nand the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-\nbacks are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim.\n\nUS Medicaid rebates\n\nMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been\nestimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population\ngrowth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation\nalso involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes\nin interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts\nthe provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates\nare generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.\n\nOther US and non-US discounts and sales returns\n\nOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals,\npharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash\ndiscounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded\nas a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales\nreturns relate to damaged or expired products.\n\nNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020 / 52\n\nOther net sales disclosures\n\nIn 2020, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in\nthe US, representing 19%, 13% and 12% respectively of total net sales (19%,\n14% and 12% in 2019 and 20%, 13% and 13% in 2018). Sales to these three\nwholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm.\n\nNet sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts\ncontaining fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater\nthan 12 months, are expected to be DKK 431 million within 12 months (DKK\n544 million in 2019) and DKK 216 million thereafter (DKK 32 million in 2019).\n\nNovo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note\n4.2 for development in key exchange rates.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has\ntransferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that\nNovo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for\ntransferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a point\nin time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based\non the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its\ngoods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for\na variety of sales deductions, including product returns as well as rebates\nand discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance\ncompanies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales\ndeductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net\nsales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable\nconsideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo\nNordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.\n\nIn some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis.\nWhere there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of\nfuture returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in\nsales. Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis,\nwithout sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue\nis recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well-\nestablished products with similar market characteristics. If similar market\ncharacteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of\nconsumption or when the right of return has expired.\n\nUnsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount\nis uncertain (note 3.6).\n\nWhere absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other\nliabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs are netted against trade receivable balances.\n", "vlm_text": "Section 2  Results for the year \n2.1 Net sales and rebates \nThe table contains financial data in DKK (Danish Krone) millions for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating  price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and  government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their  formularies (or 'preferred drug lists'). \nUS Managed Care and Medicare \nFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of  PBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the  customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters  relating to formulary status or pre-established market shares thresholds.  Rebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement,  historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market  share information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to  reflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are  generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date. \nUS wholesaler charge-backs \nWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo  Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at  contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. A  wholesaler charge-back represents the difference between the invoice price  to the wholesaler and the indirect customer’s contract price. Accruals are  calculated for estimated charge-backs using a combination of factors such  as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms  and the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge- backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim. \nUS Medicaid rebates \nMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been  estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population  growth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation  also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes  in interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts  the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates  are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date. \nOther US and non-US discounts and sales returns \nOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals,  pharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash  discounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded  as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales  returns relate to damaged or expired products. \nOther net sales disclosures \nIn 2020, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in  the US, representing   $19\\%,$  ,   $13\\%$   and  $12\\%$   respectively of total net sales (  $.19\\%,$  ,   $14\\%$   and  $12\\%$   in 2019 and   $20\\%_{i}$  ,   $\\uparrow3\\%$   and  $\\uparrow3\\%$   in 2018). Sales to these three  wholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm. \nNet sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts  containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater  than 12 months, are expected to be DKK 431 million within 12 months (DKK  544 million in 2019) and DKK 216 million thereafter (DKK 32 million in 2019). \nNovo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note  4.2 for development in key exchange rates. \nAccounting policies \nRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has  transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that  Novo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for  transferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a point  in time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based  on the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its  goods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for  a variety of sales deductions, including product returns as well as rebates  and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance  companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales  deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net  sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable  consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo  Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied. \nIn some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis.  Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of  future returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in  sales. Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis,  without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue  is recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well- established products with similar market characteristics. If similar market  characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of  consumption or when the right of return has expired.  \nUnsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount  is uncertain (note 3.6). \nWhere absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other  liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs are netted against trade receivable balances.  "}

Significant  judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide accrual  for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and provisions  for uncertain tax positions. \nNovo Nordisk recognises deferred income tax assets if it is probable that  sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the  temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised.  \nManagement has considered future taxable income and applied its  judgement in assessing whether deferred income tax assets should be  recognised. \nIn the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing  disputes with tax authorities may occur. Management judgement is applied  to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. The 'most probable  outcome' method is applied when making provisions for uncertain tax  positions, and Novo Nordisk considers the provisions made to be adequate.  However, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of  litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities. \nThis table presents a financial overview of net deferred tax assets and liabilities for the year 2020, with amounts given in DKK million. The structure of the table includes several columns representing different categories: 'Property, plant and equipment,' 'Intangible assets,' 'Inventories,' 'Liabilities,' 'Other,' and an 'Offset within countries' column. \n\nThe rows in the table track changes throughout the year:\n1. **Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 1 January** - Shows the starting positions for each category at the beginning of the year, with a total of 4,041 million DKK.\n2. **Income/(charge) to the income statement** - Records changes due to income or charges, resulting in a small net change of 2 million DKK.\n3. **Income/(charge) to other comprehensive income** - Reflects adjustments unique to comprehensive income, resulting in a reduction of 577 million DKK.\n4. **Income/(charge) to equity** - Shows impact on equity with a minor change, reducing the total by 72 million DKK.\n5. **Acquisition of subsidiaries** - Represents changes due to acquiring new subsidiaries, adding 276 million DKK to the total.\n6. **Effect of exchange rate adjustment** - Accounts for changes related to currency fluctuations, reducing the total by 307 million DKK.\n\nThe resulting **Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 31 December** is shown at 3,363 million DKK. \n\nThe table also classifies this year-end net position into:\n- **Deferred tax asset at 31 December** - Totaling 5,865 million DKK.\n- **Deferred tax liability at 31 December** - Totaling (2,502) million DKK.\nThe table presents a detailed reconciliation of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities over a period, highlighting changes and classifications. Here's a breakdown of the information:\n\n1. **Net Deferred Tax Asset/(Liability) at 1 January**: This row shows the starting balances for deferred tax assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year for six different categories/columns. The numbers in parentheses indicate a liability.\n\n2. **Change in Accounting Policy, Leases**: This reflects the changes in deferred taxes due to accounting policy changes related to leases. Only one category/column is affected.\n\n3. **Income/(Charge) to the Income Statement**: This shows adjustments made to the deferred tax balances reflected in the income statement for each category/column.\n\n4. **Income/(Charge) to Other Comprehensive Income**: This records changes related to other comprehensive income, affecting two categories/columns.\n\n5. **Income/(Charge) to Equity**: This identifies changes impacting equity directly from deferred tax adjustments, affecting one category/column.\n\n6. **Disposal of Subsidiaries**: This represents changes due to the disposal of subsidiaries, affecting one category/column.\n\n7. **Effect of Exchange Rate Adjustment**: This captures adjustments arising from exchange rate changes on deferred taxes, usually minor adjustments for each category/column.\n\n8. **Net Deferred Tax Asset/(Liability) at 31 December**: This is the reconciled ending balance for the year, showing deferred tax positions for each category/column as of December 31. \n\n9. **Classified as follows**:\n   - **Deferred Tax Asset at 31 December**: This breaks down the year-end balances of deferred tax assets within each category/column.\n   - **Deferred Tax Liability at 31 December**: This details the year-end balances of deferred tax liabilities within each category/column.\n\nThe table provides a comprehensive look at how deferred tax positions have evolved throughout the year, including impacts from policy changes, income statement impacts, and other comprehensive income effects."}

The right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment\nand the lease liability in borrowings.\n\nFor contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-\nuse asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at\ncost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is\nsubsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term.\nThe right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of\nthe lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses.\n\nThe lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a\nlease, together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain\nto be exercised. When determining the term, Management considers multiple\nfactors that create economic incentives to exercise an option to extend the\nlease or not to terminate the lease, including termination penalties, potential\nrelocation costs and whether significant leasehold improvements have been\ncapitalised on the lease, with a remaining useful life which exceeds the fixed\nminimum duration of the lease. For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen\nleases), the Group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination\nperiod if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease\npayments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the\nincremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured using the effective\ninterest method. Variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate\nare recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. Residual\nvalue guarantees that are expected to be paid are included in the initial\nmeasurement of the lease liability.\n\nThe lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease\npayments, typically due to a change in index or rate (e.g. inflation) on property\nleases, or if there is a reassessment of whether an extension or termination\noption will be exercised. A corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-\nuse asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been\nfully depreciated.\n\nNew lease contracts with a lease term of 12 months or less and lease of low\nvalue assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. These are expensed\nona straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis.\nLease of low value assets include personal computers, telephones and small\nitems of office equipment.\n\nAs of 31 December 2020, the lease liability excludes DKK 2,363 million\n(undiscounted) of potential lease payments related to lease term extension\nrights on properties which were not considered reasonably certain to be\nexercised (DKK 2,760 million in 2019).\n", "vlm_text": "Property, plant and equipment  \nThe table presents financial data in Danish Krone (DKK) millions for the years 2020, 2019, and 2018.

These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account\nin the valuation of trade receivables.\n\nDuring 2020 country risk ratings have been downgraded in a number of\ncountries. However, despite of the COVID-19 pandemic, Novo Nordisk has\nnot experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual\ncustomers nor have we experienced significant deterioration in the ageing\nof receivables. Please refer to note 4.2 for the trade receivable programmes.\n\nAccounting policies\n\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and\nsubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest\nmethod, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The allocation of\ntrade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the\nlocation of the customer.\n\nBefore being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair\nvalue with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance\nfor doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade\nreceivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement\nunder sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts\npreviously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.\n\nNovo Nordisk’s customer base comprises government agencies,\nwholesalers, retail pharmacies and other customers. Management makes\nallowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach\nto provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime\nexpected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an\nestimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.\nGenerally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of\ngoods.

These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account  in the valuation of trade receivables.  \nDuring 2020 country risk ratings have been downgraded in a number of  countries. However, despite of the COVID-19 pandemic, Novo Nordisk has  not experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual  customers nor have we experienced significant deterioration in the ageing  of receivables. Please refer to note 4.2 for the trade receivable programmes.  \nAccounting policies \nTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest  method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The allocation of  trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the  location of the customer. \nBefore being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair  value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance  for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade  receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement  under sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts  previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs. \nNovo Nordisk’s customer base comprises government agencies,  wholesalers, retail pharmacies and other customers. Management makes  allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach  to provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime  expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an  estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due.  Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of  goods.

Novo Nordisk does not expect the above investigations to have a material  impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow. \nNovo Nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received  requests for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products  from several committees of the Unites States House of Representatives  and/or United States Senate. Novo Nordisk is working with the staff of the  various committees to respond to their questions. Novo Nordisk does not  expect the inquiries to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial  position, operating profit or cash flow. \nOther contingent liabilities \nIn addition to the above, the Novo Nordisk Group is engaged in certain  litigation proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. In  the opinion of Management, neither settlement or continuation of such  proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to  have a material effect on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit  or cash flow. \nAccounting policies \nProvisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government  agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other  customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded  or when the incentives are offered. Provisions are calculated based on  historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements.  Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or  amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates  are recognised as other liabilities. Please refer to note 2.1 for further  information on sales rebates and provisions. \nProvisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive  obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable  that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated.  In this case, Novo Nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation  of the most likely outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be  made are disclosed as contingent liabilities. \nProvisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated  expenditure for settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate  that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and  the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision for interest  is recognised as a financial expense. \nNovo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal  business. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate  estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for  estimated product returns is recorded. The provision is measured at gross  sales value. \nKey accounting estimate regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation  and investigations \nProvisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provision linked  to ongoing legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding  provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and  potential future litigation outcomes. These are by nature dependent on  inherently uncertain future events. When determining likely outcomes of  litigation, etc., Management considers the input of external counsels on  each case, as well as known outcomes in case law. \n3.7 Other liabilities \nOther liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables  related to non-current assets, and sales rebates. \nAlthough Management believes that the total provisions for legal  proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there  can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters,  or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not  be material.

A limited assurance\nengagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in\nrelation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal\ncontrol, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently,\nthe level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially\nlower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance\nengagement been performed.\n\nOur independence and quality control\n\nWe have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the\nInternational Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and\nother ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity,\nprofessional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.

The accounting policies are the same as for the\nconsolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below.\nFor a description of the accounting policies of the Group, please refer to the\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent\ncompany; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group.\n\nChange of presentation of equity\n\nThe Danish Financial Statements Act has been amended effective from 1\nJanuary 2020 to require an equity reserve corresponding to income and\nexpenses on cash flow hedges recognised in equity (‘Reserve for cash flow\nhedges'). These transactions have previously been recognised in retained\nearnings. The reserve for cash flow hedges is distributable.\n\nThe amendment has been implemented retrospectively. The impact at the\nbeginning of 2019 is recognition of a reserve for cash flow hedges\namounting to DKK (1,506) million and a corresponding increase in retained\nearnings. The implementation had no impact on total equity. The movement\nin the reserve for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,183 million, resulting in a reserve\nof DKK (323) million at the end of 2019.\n\nSupplementary accounting policies for the parent company\n\nFinancial assets\n\nIn the financial statements of the parent company, investments in\nsubsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity\nmethod, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries\nand associated companies. The equity method is used as a measurement\nbasis rather than a consolidation method. The net profit of subsidiaries and\nassociated companies less unrealised intra-group profits is recorded in the\nincome statement of the parent company.\n\nTo the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such\ncompanies, the net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated\ncompanies is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according\nto the equity method. Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are\ndisclosed as profit after tax.\n\nTax\n\nFor Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its\nDanish subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a\nDanish on-account tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax.

The accounting policies are the same as for the  consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below.  For a description of the accounting policies of the Group, please refer to the  consolidated financial statements. \nNo separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent  company; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group. \nChange of presentation of equity \nThe Danish Financial Statements Act has been amended effective from 1 January 2020 to require an equity reserve corresponding to income and expenses on cash flow hedges recognised in equity ('Reserve for cash flow hedges'). These transactions have previously been recognised in retained  earnings. The reserve for cash flow hedges is distributable. \nThe amendment has been implemented retrospectively. The impact at the beginning of 2019 is recognition of a reserve for cash flow hedges  amounting to DKK (1,506) million and a corresponding increase in retained  earnings. The implementation had no impact on total equity. The movement  in the reserve for 2019 amounted to DKK 1,183 million, resulting in a reserve  of DKK (323) million at the end of 2019. \nSupplementary accounting policies for the parent company \nFinancial assets \nIn the financial statements of the parent company, investments in  subsidiaries and associated companies are recorded under the equity  method, using the respective share of the net asset values in subsidiaries  and associated companies. The equity method is used as a measurement  basis rather than a consolidation method. The net profit of subsidiaries and  associated companies less unrealised intra-group profits is recorded in the  income statement of the parent company. \nTo the extent that net profit exceeds declared dividends from such  companies, the net revaluation of investments in subsidiaries and associated  companies is transferred to net revaluation reserve under equity according  to the equity method. Profits in subsidiaries and associated companies are  disclosed as profit after tax. \nTax \nFor Danish tax purposes, the parent company is assessed jointly with its  Danish subsidiaries. The Danish jointly taxed companies are included in a  Danish on-account tax payment scheme for Danish corporate income tax. All  current taxes under the scheme are recorded in the individual companies.  Novo Nordisk A/S and its Danish subsidiaries are included in the joint  taxation of the parent company, Novo Holdings A/S. \nThe table presents sales data in DKK million for the years 2020 and 2019.
