Therefore, the Court applies Nevada law to this case. Nevada law expressly recognizes the  imposition of constructive trusts.  Numerous courts have recognized that it is appropriate to issue  a temporary restraining order and freeze assets to preserve the funds for the equitable remedy.   Further, numerous district courts, including at least one other district judge in the Eastern District  of Louisiana, have issued a TRO in this exact circumstance to freeze a cryptocurrency asset.   \n  Plaintiff has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits of his conversion claim.  Under Nevada law, conversion is “a distinct act of dominion wrongfully exerted over another’s  personal property in denial of, or inconsistent with his title or rights therein or in derogation,  \n31   Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc. , 527 U.S. 308 (1999).  32  Rec. Doc. 1 at 9–10.  33   See  La. Civ. Code art. 3542.   \n34   See Holland v. Anthony L. Barney, Ltd. , 139 Nev. Adv. Op. 49, 540 P.3d 1074, 1083 (Nev. App. 2023)  (“Equitable remedies, such as equitable liens and constructive trusts, are available to a plaintiff when legal remedies,  such as statutory review, are not available or are inadequate. The Nevada Supreme Court previously approved the use  of the Restatement (First) of Restitution (1937), [] and recognized both equitable liens and constructive trusts as  remedies to restore property belonging to another.”) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \nAssuming that Louisiana law applies to this case, the Louisiana Civil Code prohibits the imposition of a  constructive trust or equitable lien on any property.  Mansfield Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Johnson , 268 F.2d 317, 319  (5th Cir. 1959). However, Louisiana courts regularly grant writs of sequestration and place assets in the registry of the  court during the adjudication process.  See  La. Code of Civ. Pro. art. 3571. A writ of sequestration is equitable in nature  because the plaintiff is seeking that the court compels the defendant to perform a certain act or refrain from a certain  act.  \n35   In re Focus Media, Inc. , 387 F.3d 1077, 1084 (9th Cir. 2004);  Absolute Activist Value Master Fund Ltd. v.
