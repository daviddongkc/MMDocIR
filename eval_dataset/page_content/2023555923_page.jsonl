A register of lobbyists has previously  been rejected by Sweden’s parliament, but the proposal is currently being reviewed by  a special government committee following international criticism of Sweden’s lack of  transparency in government-lobbyist contacts.   \nAs of 2019, government ministers and their state secretaries must notify the Review  Board for Ministers and Certain Officials’ Transfer Restrictions when they leave their  position with the state for a position in the private sector.   \nSweden does not have laws requiring that foreign agents register with the government  or someone else. Pending legislation would require that direct investments by  foreigners in sensitive industries be reported to the government. The legislation as  proposed does not include any disclosure requirements for foreign ownership in lobby  or media corporations, but such requirements could be added in the future.    \nI.
