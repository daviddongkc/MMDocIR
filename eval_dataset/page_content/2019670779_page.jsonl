Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist\n\nThe Hotlist currently includes 573 ingredients listed, the use of which are either prohibited or\nrestricted.31 Health Canada describes the Hotlist as “an administrative tool that is used to\ncommunicate to manufacturers and others that certain substances, when present in a cosmetic,\nmay contravene the general prohibition found in section 16 of the FDA,” which states that “no\nperson shall sell any cosmetic that may cause injury to the health of the user when the cosmetic\nis used.” Additionally, according to Health Canada,’3 the presence of a substance from the\nHotlist in a product may cause that product to be excluded from the definition of a cosmetic under\nthe FDA.\n\nThe Hotlist is not exhaustive and is continuously being updated. Proposed updates to the Hotlist\nare put forward as needed, and decisions on the updates depend on the strength of the scientific\nevidence ranging from recognized scientific journals to expert panel opinions.* As the Hotlist is\ncontinually growing, a manufacturer or importer should not rely entirely on the list, and the sale\nof a cosmetic should stop as soon as it is known that an ingredient may cause injury. Once a\nproposal to update the Hotlist is put forward, a Notice to Stakeholders is issued approximately\nthree months before a 60-day consultation period on proposed updates.*5 In this amount of time,\nHealth Canada expects manufacturers and importers to determine which of their products might\nbe affected by a possible update.

Cosmetic Ingredient Hotlist  \nThe Hotlist currently includes 573   ingredients listed, the use of which are either prohibited or  restricted.  Health Canada describes the Hotlist as “an administrative tool that is used to  communicate to manufacturers and others that certain substances, when present in a cosmetic,  may contravene the general prohibition found in section 16 of the FDA,” which states that “no  person shall sell any cosmetic that may cause injury to the health of the user when the cosmetic  is used.” 32  Additionally, according to Health Canada,  the presence of a substance from the  Hotlist in a product may cause that product to be excluded from the definition of a cosmetic under  the FDA.  \nThe Hotlist is not exhaustive and is continuously being updated. Proposed updates to the Hotlist  are put forward as needed, and decisions on the updates depend on the strength of the scientific  evidence ranging from recognized scientific journals to expert panel opinions.  As the Hotlist is  continually growing, a manufacturer or importer should not rely entirely on the list, and the sale  of a cosmetic should stop as soon as it is known that an ingredient may cause injury. Once a  proposal to update the Hotlist is put forward, a Notice to Stakeholders is issued approximately  three months before a 60-day consultation   period on proposed updates.  In this amount of time,  Health Canada expects manufacturers and importers to determine which of their products might  be affected by a possible update. If they have products that might be affected, during this time  they can start planning changes to their “product formulations, distribution and sale.” 36  After the  60-day consultation period, but before it publishes the final revised version of the Hotlist, Health  Canada will evaluate the comments it received and respond to them.  Health Canada publishes  the revised hotlist on the official website. Additionally, Health Canada will send the updated list  to subscribers to the Cosmetics Mailing List,  as well as those who have previously submitted a  CNF.  The last update   to the Hotlist was made in December 2019.     "}

Turkish Framework’s Relationship with the EU Framework  \nThe Cosmetics Regulation of 2005 is the main legislation of the Turkish cosmetics framework. The  Cosmetics Regulation was prepared in parallel to the European Union acquis on the regulation  of cosmetics, and in particular, with reference to Directive 76/768/EEC 3  and Commission  Decision 96/335/EC,  with a view to harmonizing Turkish law with European Union law in the  area of cosmetics.  \nThe Turkish framework is designed to be interoperable with the EU system and to facilitate the  movement of cosmetic products within the EU-Turkey customs union. The Cosmetics Regulation  authorizes the Turkish Medicines and Medical Devices Agency to update the prohibited or  limited substances lists provided in the Regulation in line with developments in EU law and the  state of the art in the relevant sciences.  Furthermore, the Turkish cosmetics registry system uses  the European Commission’s database for cosmetic substances and ingredients, known as CosIng,  and the Agency is charged with notifying the European Commission of cases where it has taken  measures against a cosmetic product made available on the Turkish market upon the discovery  that it poses a health hazard to humans.   \nIn 2009, the EU framework for cosmetics was revised by the adoption of Regulation  1223/2009/EC, which replaced Directive 76/768/EEC.  The Cosmetics Regulation was amended  in 2015 to reflect in Turkish law the changes to the EU’s regulatory framework.   \nThe Cosmetics Regulation and the framework it establishes is applicable to “cosmetic products,”  defined in the same terms as in article 1(1) of Directive 76/768/EEC,  as  "}

As a result of this law, the Regulation  continues to apply in the UK in the same way as in member states of the European Union.  \nThe Regulation provides that it is an offense to supply cosmetic products that may cause damage  to human health or cosmetic products that contain restricted or prohibited substances. The term  “cosmetic product” is defined in Article 2 of the Regulation as:  \nany substance or mixture intended to be placed in contact with the external parts of the  human body (epidermis, hair system, nails, lips and external genital organs) or with the  teeth and the mucous membranes of the oral cavity with a view exclusively or mainly to  cleaning them, perfuming them, changing their appearance, protecting them, keeping  them in good condition or correcting body odours.   \nII.  Registration of Cosmetic Facilities  \nRegistration of cosmetic facilities is governed by the Regulation as part of the UK’s retained EU  law. For further details, please see the EU report.    "}

Safety Review\n\nThe required safety assessment of cosmetic products in the UK continues to be governed by the\nRegulation as part of the UK’s retained EU law. For further details, please see the EU report.\n\nIV. Adverse Event Reporting\n\nThe Regulation governs how adverse events involving cosmetics must be reported. The\ncompetent authority across the UK is the Secretary of State. The enforcement authorities in\nEngland, Wales, and Scotland are Trading Standards, and in Northern Ireland, the enforcement\nauthority is any district council.*\n\nV. Cosmetics Labeling\n\nIf a cosmetic product is not prepackaged or is packaged at the point of sale upon the purchaser’s\nrequest, the label information required by the Regulation’s article 19(1) must be placed on the\ncontainer, or within the immediate proximity of the container.5 Cosmetic products that are\nprepackaged for immediate sale must also include this information, either on a label, tape, or tag\nattached to the package or on a card or an enclosed leaflet. In cases where there are practical\nreasons making it impossible to provide the information in this manner, it must be on a notice\nimmediately next to the container where the cosmetic product is available for purchase.°\n\nVI. Good Manufacturing Practices\n\nThe UK follows the manufacturing practices set out in the Regulation. In 2017, regulations were\nintroduced in England banning the use of microplastics (also referred to as microbeads) in the\nmanufacture of rinse-off personal care products along with the supply of such products\ncontaining microplastics.” Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland introduced similar regulations\nin 2018 and 2019.8 A rinse-off personal care product is defined as\n\nany substance, or mixture of substances, manufactured for the purpose of being applied to\nany relevant human body part in the course of any personal care treatment, by an\napplication which entails at its completion the prompt and specific removal of the product\n(or any residue of the product) by washing or rinsing with water, rather than leaving it to\nwear off or wash off, or be absorbed or shed, in the course of time... .2\n\n+ Cosmetic Products Enforcement Regulations 2013, SI 2013/1478, §j 4, https:/ / perma.cc/ N3ZA-HY9X.\n51d. 45.\nId. § 2.\n\n7 Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, SI 2017/1312, https:/ / perma.cc/5UUY-\nAQMR.\n\n8 Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (Scotland) Regulations 2018, SSI 2018/162, https: // perma.cc/9QZE-\nA7G8; Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (Wales) Regulations 2018, WSI 2018/760 (W. 151),\n\nhttps:/ / perma.cc/ WD95-G4S9; and Environmental Protection (Microbeads) Regulations (Northern Ireland)\n2019, SR 2019/18, https:/ / perma.cc/ Y9AV-S2W4.\n\n° Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017, 2.\n", "vlm_text": "III.
