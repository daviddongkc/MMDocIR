The power to issue CBKs was granted to the  president by constitutional amendments adopted in 2017. Being novel to Turkish  constitutional law tradition, the power has since been a focal point of interest in legal  scholarship and a matter of controversy in practice. This report explores in light of  recent scholarship and Constitutional Court decisions what we know and do not know  regarding the scope and limits of the president’s power to issue CBKs. Finally, the  report examines a recent controversy that arose from the use of a CBK to authorize the  president to withdraw from international treaties.

The constitutional amendments abolished the council  of ministers and transferred its authority to make delegated legislation to the president, which  under the new system constitutes a unitary executive.
